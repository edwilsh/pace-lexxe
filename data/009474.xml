  <title>Winery worker crushed by falling frame</title>
  <content>
A MAN has been seriously injured while helping to rebuild in WA's fire-ravaged south.
The 64-year-old man was crushed by a verandah frame on Wednesday morning at Drakesbrook Winery in Waroona.
Winery owner Bernie Worthington says the victim was conscious but in a lot of pain.
The man was taken to hospital in Perth where he is expected to make a full recovery.
Mr Worthington said the accident is just another part of a tough 18 months.
"We were wiped out in the 2016 Waroona-Yarloop fires, I think we were the first private property hit," Mr Worthington said.
"The whole property was wiped out."
A man has also been flown to Royal Perth Hospital after he was pinned underneath a tree in a separate accident in WA's south.
The man was trapped at a property in Hesterbrook, near Bridgetown.
He escaped with only minor injuries.
