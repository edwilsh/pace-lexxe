  <title>Dirt biker impaled in NSW bush race</title>
  <content>
A dirt biker's leg has become impaled on a branch while racing down a remote bush track near Newcastle.
A CareFlight helicopter was dispatched to the accident scene at Olney, on the edge of the Watagan National Park, just after 4pm on Saturday.
The rider, 35, had crashed and was speared along the length of his thigh by a small branch.
NSW Ambulance crews were also on the scene and provided initial treatment before transferring the man to the chopper.
A specialist doctor and critical care paramedic provided further treatment and he was then flown to Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney in a stable condition.
