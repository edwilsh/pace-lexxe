  <content>
UPDATE 11.30am: A BMA worker has been seriously injured at the Goonyella Riverside mine site on Saturday morning.

He is a husband and father of a 11-month-old baby boy and believed to be in surgery currently.

A BMA spokesman confirmed the incident.

Queensland Ambulance Service was called to the site about 1am on Saturday.

The 31-year-old man is believed to have sustained a head injury.

"BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) confirms that an incident occurred at Goonyellla Riverside Mine today, which resulted in a serious injury to one of our people," the spokesman said.

"Our highest priority at this stage is for the care of the individual involved in the incident.

"BMA is working closely with the relevant authorities on this incident."

The Daily Mercury understands that workers turning up for their shifts this morning didn't get past the gate, and were sent back to camp.

The injured worker was transported to Mackay Base Hospital.

Goonyella Riverside is an open cut mine that's about 30km north of Moranbah.

Mining began at Riverside in 1982.

INITIAL: A man is in a serious condition at the Mackay Base Hospital after sustaining a head injury at Goonyella Mine, Moranbah.

Queensland Ambulance was called to the scene at 1:05am on Saturday morning.

It was suggested that he was hit in the head with an object.
