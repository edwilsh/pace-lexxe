Jason Johannisen was a late withdrawal for the Bulldogs

THE WESTERN Bulldogs have made a late change for the clash against Brisbane at the Gabba with travelling emergency Bob Murphy coming into the side at the expense of Jason Johannisen.

Johannisen was ruled out of the game with a sore back.

The Dogs then suffered a big blow in the opening term, losing acting captain Easton Wood to a hamstring injury.

The 27-year-old was tackled by young Lion Jarrod Berry halfway through the first quarter, and was swung in a wide arc to the ground. He remained on the ground after the tackle, clutching his left hamstring. 

A glum Wood was assisted off the ground by trainers. He suffered numerous hamstring injuries in the early portion of his career, and had two hamstring setbacks last year.

More to come.
