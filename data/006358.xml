  <title>Former SA bikie boss to appeal convictions</title>
  <content>
The former South Australian president of the Nomads bikie gang is seeking to appeal his convictions for ordering disciplinary action against other gang members overturned.
Honar Pishdari was found guilty of two counts of participating in a criminal organisation and with aggravated kidnapping and blackmail in relation to the incidents, including some that involved a former vice-president of the gang.
In May, he was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years behind bars but his case will come before the Court of Criminal Appeal on Wednesday where he will seek leave to overturn his convictions.
Sentencing Pishdari and other gang members earlier this year, Justice David Peek said their actions were outrageous and tantamount to those of a paramilitary organisation.
In one incident, Pishdari ordered action be taken against a gang member who had asked for protection from authorities while in jail, something the gang viewed as reprehensible and a sign of weakness.
