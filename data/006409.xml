A person died after their car crashed into a rock retaining wall on Fairbairn Avenue, Campbell, late on Tuesday night.
It appears a Mazda sedan came down Mount Ainslie Drive and through the intersection before crashing into the rock retaining wall on Fairbairn Avenue at speed.
ACT Policing Acting Sergeant Stephen Dzido said authorities were called about 10.30pm about the single-vehicle crash.
"The vehicle suffered heavy front end damage as a result of the [crash] into the brick wall," he said
Emergency services cut away the top of the car to extract the person, who was the only one in the car at the time. Intensive care paramedics treated the person, however, they died at the scene.
"A occupant of the vehicle has unfortunately died. ACT Policing's Collision and Investigation Reconstruction Team has attended and will prepare a report for the coroner," he said.

Sergeant Dzido said he did not want to reveal the person's gender or age as authorities were contacting their family.
