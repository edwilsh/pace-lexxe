  <title>Battered bus is a renovator's dream</title>
  <content>
A FUNKY old bus which has spent many years languishing at New Norfolk's Willow Court Antique Centre is being restored to transport tourists around southern Tasmania.
Paul Oakley, who runs a sheet metal and industrial insulation business, has bought the 1948 model REO bus and plans to restore it to its original state - a task likely to take some time.
"I plan to restore it to a period bus, which I reckon will take me a couple of years, and then do something with it within the tourism industry," Mr Oakley said.
"Perhaps that could be winery tours, perhaps something else, but it will be great to get it on the road again."
He hopes someone might be able to shed some more light on the history of the US-built vehicle.
"I know the bus was owned by a company in Burnie called Tatlows until 1975," Mr Oakley said.
"It then came down south and took a local family to Queensland.
"It then sat in a paddock at Lachlan and was then acquired by Willow Court."
Anyone who can provide more information on the vehicle's history can contact Mr Oakley on 0418 913 964.
