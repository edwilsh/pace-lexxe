  <title>Books help children understand why Defence Force parents aren't always home</title>

When first-time mum Hayley Boswell couldn't find a children's book to help her explain what her Navy husband did to her daughter, she wrote her own.
A human rights lawyer by trade, Ms Boswell is on maternity leave with her daughter Evie.
She grew up in a Defence Force family - her father was an army cook.
Her husband, Brad Boswell, is a Chief Petty Officer marine technician in the Royal Australian Navy and is often deployed on seafaring duties.
"At about 2 o'clock one morning I had this moment when I thought it was not really fair that a lot of children are at home while their parents are deployed," Ms Boswell said.
"I thought it would be nice to have a book that they could read about their family and how important their parents' jobs are."
What began as a book for Mr Boswell to read to Evie when he was home gained attention after he shared the story with friends on Facebook.
"We started getting orders from friends to make books for their kids," Ms Boswell said.
Mums, dads and all Defence forces included

She soon created a version for Navy mothers and Army mums and dads, and there's an Air Force version on the way.
"It was just something I thought would be important for children to read, so I felt pretty honoured that people wanted to read it," Ms Boswell said.

Her work received such a strong response in Australia that she is now exploring overseas versions.
"I've submitted my work to a few publishers in the UK and US, and one [submission] is before the board of editors at the moment," she said.
"It's going a lot better than I thought it ever would have."
Ms Boswell said she had received a lot of feedback on how her book was helping to ease the anxiety felt by some children when a parent left on a deployment.
She has also thought about creating versions for fly-in fly-out workers and other professions.
"If there's a market, and I think it is needed for those children, then of course I'll do it," she said.
