Police allegedly seized two Colt 1911 .45-calibre automatic pistols, a .25-calibre Walther TP-model pistol and a Bentley-brand 12-gauge shotgun during raids on properties at Revesby and Granville.
They also seized a mobile phone on which they allegedly found footage showing the man "sky-larking with one of the Colt .45 handguns, pointing it at his four-year-old daughter and pulling the trigger".Photo: NSW Police
"The weapon did not discharge," police said. 
Other phone footage allegedly showed the girl playing with an automatic pistol and pulling the trigger without effect.

Further phone images allegedly showed the man pointing a shotgun at the camera.

The man was charged with six offences: four counts of illegal firearm possession, allowing an unauthorised person to possess a firearm and production of child abuse material (firearm) pursuant to Section 91H of the NSW Crimes Act.
Assistant Commissioner Mark Murdoch condemned the father's alleged behaviour. 
"Allowing a child to play with a firearm of any kind is reprehensible and is a serious criminal offence," he said.
The investigation is not terror-related, police said. 
The man was refused bail and, due to the serious nature of the charges, will appear in Burwood Local Court on Tuesday.
The man will then appear before the same court on August 16 on the same charges.
