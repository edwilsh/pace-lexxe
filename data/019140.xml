  <title>Blizzards and thunder to hit Victoria</title>
  <content>
Blizzards are expected to hit Victoria's eastern alpine areas while thunderstorms and hail could batter Melbourne.
Up to half a metre of snow is expected to fall at Mt Hotham, Mt Bulla and Falls Creek with wind gusts of more than 100km/h, Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Dean Stewart says.
"There will be plenty snow up in the eastern alpine regions today with the wind set to create blizzard conditions," Mr Stewart said.
Melbourne can expect rain throughout the day with an unstable atmosphere creating conditions for possible thunderstorms and hail.
"There is a risk of thunderstorm and hail activity through much of the state including in Melbourne," he said.
Mr Stewart said the worst of the wind had passed Melbourne overnight with winds of up to 80km/h recorded by some stations.
