One lane remains closed and "heavy" traffic is backed up to the beginning of the Eastern Distributor, Transport for NSW said. 
Drivers have been advised to avoid the area if possible and expect "significant delays" of up to 30 minutes if heading south.

KENSINGTON: All lanes open on Eastern Distributor, lanes 2 & 3 southbound have re-opened on Southern Cross Dr with lane 1 still closed.

Buses in Randwick and Kensington are delayed up to 25 minutes.
No one is believed to have been hurt. Police are investigating.
