  <title>Aymen Terkmani trial: Mahmoud Hrouk's mother breaks down as accused murderer faces court</title>
  <content>
A Sydney mother has broken down in court while giving evidence at the trial of the man accused of her son's murder.
Aymen Terkmani, 24, has pleaded not guilty to the murder and sexual assault of 16-year-old Mahmoud Hrouk at East Fairfield in May 2015.
The jury today heard evidence from Hrouk's parents, who said they spent the night of May 16, 2015 searching for their son when he failed to return home.
The boy's mother, Maha Dunia, told the court she and her husband rang their son several times telling him to come home and earlier that night he had failed to turn up to a family dinner.
Ms Dunia told the court during one conversation her son told her: "Mum, I'm with Aymen, come pick me up."
She said her son was giving details of the address when the phone line cut out and she tried calling back a few times but could not reach him.
The teenager's mum cried as she gave evidence.
Earlier, the mother of seven told the court she had last seen her son at their Fairfield home the morning he went missing, when she said to him "God bless you".
The teenager's body was found the next day lying in a pool of blood at an East Fairfield house.
The trial before Justice Lucy McCallum continues.
