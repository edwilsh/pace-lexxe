  <title>Raceday focus: Warrnambool</title>
  <content>
JARROD McLean is hoping to start the new season with a bang at his home track at Warrnambool.

McLean will have six horses running at the meeting and he believes SPICY MAC (R8, No. 6) represents his best chance on the track which is rated a Heavy 10.
"She's in form, she loves it wet and she's got an in-form jockey on in Jordon Grob," McLean said.
Spicy Mac opened at $2.50 with TAB fixed odds and has firmed into $2.40.
The most interesting runner on the program is the twice Group 3 placed German galloper NACAR (R3, No. 4) who is making his best for Darren Weir in a 1400m maiden.
Punters swooped on the $2.10 TAB Fixed odds put up and have back him into $1.50.
BEST BET

SPICY MAC (R7, No. 6 $2.40)
Loves the heavy at Warrnambool. Bolted in two starts ago and then ran on well for third last start both at this track. Should be suited by 1400m.
NEXT BEST

NACAR (R3, No. 4 $1.50)
Former German galloper who has been placed at Group 3 level twice making his Australian debut in maiden company. Weir excels in winning with these international imports early in their campaign.
VALUE BET

SILVER STRATUM (R9, No. 6 $5.50)
Model of consistency who has three seconds and two thirds from his last five starts. Looks a great each-way chance again.
THE TRAINER

JARROD McLEAN

GOLD SPUR (R2, No. 5 $4.40)
"He just battled away last start. Wet track suits but he's better off over the jumps."
GREAT SOCIETY (R4, No. 8 $17)
"It's an ordinary race but it's hard to make a case for him. He needs to improve."
JOSES WALES (R7, No. 2 $8)
"He's got great heavy track form. Everyone is claiming around which means he'll be giving weight away. He should run well though."
BRYAN (R7, No. 5 $3.50)
"He won well last start but he's probably not going to run."
PRINCELY BLAZE (R8, No. 1 $5.50)
"He was going to run the previous Saturday in Adelaide but he kicked his float in. He should be competitive."
SPICY MAC (R8, No. 6 $2.50)
"She's in form, she loves it wet and she's got an in-form jockey on in Jordon Grob," McLean said.
OH BABY (R9, No. 15 $26)
"If she gets a run she'll be a place chance."
THE JOCKEY

JOHN ALLEN

One of Australia's best jockeys John Allen will be in action at Warrnambool. His best rides are NACAR (R3, No. 4 $1.50) and SILVER STRATUM (R9, No. 6).
NOTE: TAB Fixed Odds correct at time of publishing.
