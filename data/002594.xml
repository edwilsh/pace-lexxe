  <title>McLachlan hungry for one more time</title>
  <content>
Stewart McLachlan will have another crack at breaking the five-hour mark next year before switching to the unlimited category after a bittersweet Molokai 2 Oahu world title defence on Monday (AEST).

The multiple state and national board champion from Redhead claimed back-to-back crowns and record times in the 12-foot stock category at the 51.5-kilometre world paddleboard titles, crossing in five hours, two minutes and 43 seconds. Countryman Lachie Lansdown was second in 5:08:13.

McLachlan clocked 5.05:41 last year when winning on debut across the Ka'iwi Channel, known as the Channel of Bones, between the Hawaiian islands.
Although happy to win again, the 28-year-old was disappointed to miss his goal of finishing inside five hours.
"It felt a lot easier than last year for the first four hours," said McLachlan, who was greeted by his pregnant wife, Tabitha, at the finish.
"We were holding a really fast time and I was shooting for 4.30, 4.40. I thought I would beat my record by at least 20 minutes.
"But the last 10ks, the tide changed, which was predicted, but the water was just so strong against us. The last six kilometres took me 50 minutes to do. I can do that in 30 minutes if it's dead. It just showed how hard the water was pulling against us even though the wind was behind us.

"I wanted to break five hours, though, so it's disappointing, but it's bittersweet because I lowered my record, which is good, and I won, which is great."

He also lost time at the start after a mix-up.
"They put a red flag up when there's three minutes to the start," he said. "I was 100 metres from the line so I paddled over and 10 seconds after I got there, they fired the gun. They went early. There would be 200 paddlers there and I had to go around them."
McLachlan finished fourth overall as Kurrawa's Matt Bevilacqua powered to his third consecutive win in the unlimited category, bettering his record by finishing in 4.29:20. The unlimited boards are as long as 19-feet, allowing for quicker times rolling along ocean swells, which were over two metres high on Monday.

McLachlan, a lay-down paddler, was planning to one day challenge for that title. 
"At this stage I can't go in the unlimited because no one makes lay-down boards," he said. "Kracka, who is based at Redhead, is upgrading their factory and going to do 18-footers, and he will make me a lay-down 18-footer, so that's the plan.
"I probably would have done it next year had I broken five hours, but now that I haven't, I'll probably wait another year to do that."
He said the conditions this year were "pretty gnarly and intense".
"The swell was definitely bigger this year because that wind was really up," he said. "Some were pretty massive. You don't want to be on the wrong one.

"I lost my board at China Wall, the big cliff face as you come in. It was five, six-foot crashing into a sheer cliff face and I lost my board getting hit by a rebound."
