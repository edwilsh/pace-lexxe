Hunter Valley health officials say an internal investigation is underway after another suicide at a Newcastle mental health centre.
The ABC has been told a woman is the latest Mater Mental Health Centre patient to take their own life.

If you or anyone you know needs help:

It comes after the , and the death of 30-year-old Tyson Matthews just days after he was released in 2013.
The State Government has just announced a series of community consultation sessions as part of a review into seclusion, restraint and observation practices at its mental health facilities.
There will be a consultation in Newcastle on August 14.
Minister for Mental Health Tanya Davies has been informed of the recent death.
A spokeswoman for Hunter New England Health said the matter had been referred to the coroner.
"In the interest of the patient's privacy and the coronial process, we are unable to provide any further information at this time," she said.

"Hunter New England Health has also begun an internal investigation and advised the Ministry of Health.
"Hunter New England Health is in the process of implementing a series of Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) and coronial recommendations at the Mater Mental Health Centre."
The State Opposition's mental health spokeswoman Tania Mihailuk told the ABC she wanted answers.
"Well the community needs assurances that NSW mental health units are adequately resourced," she said.
"It is most concerning that we hear about these tragic deaths occurring in our mental health units in our hospitals."
Ms Mihailuk said she hoped the health service's internal investigation pulled no punches.
"There's no point in doing internal reviews if in the end our communities are not receiving the assurances that they should be that these mental health units are proving a high standard of care," she said.
