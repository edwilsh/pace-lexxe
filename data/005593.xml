  <title>Europe's economic expansion rolls on</title>
  <content>
Europe's economic expansion keeps rolling on and even picked up a little speed in the second quarter.
The economy in the 19 countries that use the euro currency expanded by 0.6 per cent compared to the quarter before and by 2.1 per cent compared to a year earlier.
The official figures announced on Tuesday compared with a 0.5 per cent quarterly expansion in the first quarter.
The eurozone is being boosted by a growing global economy, buoyant consumer and business sentiment and massive monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank.
The ECB has been reluctant to announce when it will dial back the stimulus in the form of bond purchases slated to run at least through year end.
That's because annual inflation at 1.3 per cent remains below its goal of just under 2 per cent.
