  <title>NT politician claims counter-terror raids were part of conspiracy to boost Coalition's poll numbers</title>
  <content>
A Labor NT Government MLA has landed herself in hot water after suggesting Sydney's terror raids were part of a Coalition conspiracy to boost its standing in the polls.
The NT Member for Katherine, Sandra Nelson, used Twitter to make her accusation while watching ABC's Q and A program.
"Polling for LNP not good. Therefore we now have a "terrorist attack". How convenient. #qanda" she wrote.
When she was called out by journalist Ted McDonnell for her comments she responded, "...I'm paraphrasing your pals that can't confirm anything but didn't hesitate in creating panic."
Today, she had changed her tune.
"I do realise now that while it was a throwaway comment it was a mistake and ... reading back on it, it does come across as being insensitive."
Despite admitting her mistake, the Labor backbencher was still insistent she was paraphrasing.

"My comment really was just a paraphrase of a conversation last night and it was in response to another Twitter conversation," she said.

Ms Nelson also called for political parties, including her own, to stop using terrorism as a political football.
"Obviously they reacted and responded in a way that they thought was appropriate in the information that was given to them."
The controversy has prompted a rebuke from Country Liberals Senator and Federal Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Nigel Scullion, who has labelled the comments offensive.
It also received a lashing from Ms Nelson's own team.
"It does not reflect the views of the Gunner Government at all. We know there is a very real threat of terrorism out there," Deputy Chief Minister Nicole Manison said.
"It was an inappropriate comment to make. She should not have made that tweet. She should not have made that comment. She has apologised for that."
The tweets have since been deleted.
