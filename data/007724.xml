  <title>Stephen Colbert channels Queen to bid farewell to Anthony Scaramucci</title>
  <content>
US comedian Stephen Colbert has penned a farewell to axed White House communications boss Anthony Scaramucci, in a continuation of his Bohemian Rhapsody spoof that welcomed the Wall Street financier to the role just days earlier.
after just 10 days in the role.
The Late Show host, who sang a version of Queen's song when "The Mooch" was appointed [Scaramouch, Scaramouch, can you do the fandango] this week switched to a more sober part of the tune.
"Mama, I just got canned ... barely got to the White House, said some dumb stuff now I'm out ... Mama, my job had just begun, and now I've gone and thrown it all away," he crooned.
In his opening monologue on Monday night's show, Mr Colbert said the news left him a "broken man".
"The front stabber has been backstabbed," he joked.
"He said he was going to fire everybody and, I've got to admit, he delivered.
"The Mooch lasted as communications director for only 10 days. 10! That's not even a whole pay period.
His going-away party can serve what's left of his welcome cake."
Earlier on Monday, Mr Colbert tweeted his shock at the departure.

Other US comedians including Seth Meyers, Trevor Noah and Jimmy Kimmel were also quick to ridicule the former hedge fund manager, who sold his business in order to take up the White House position.
