Australian Story is under fire for a piece on Senator Sam Dastyari.

THE ABC has been criticised by MPs from both sides of politics after Australian Story screened a 'puff piece' on Labor senator Sam Dastyari.
The national broadcaster is under fire over Monday night's episode, which includes footage of Senator Dastyari as a teenager, discussion of his family background and an emotional visit to Iran, amid interviews with family, friends and colleagues.
Labor MP Michael Danby, Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson, government minister Zed Seselja, crossbencher Cory Bernardi and Liberal backbencher James Paterson have all called for the ABC to explain the episode, which was aired at the same time Senator Dastyari is promoting his new book, according to Fairfax.
During an radio interview this morning on ABC, the senator notably mentioned the name of his book One Halal of a Story, at least six times in an interview.
Senator Dastyari, who is known for his skills at self-promotion, also tweeted a link to an extract of the book published on the Guardian website today. A review of his book also appeared on The Australian this morning.

While Australian Story also explored the Chinese donation scandal that saw Senator Dastyari , Senator Cory Bernardi told Fairfax the treatment was a "sterilisation of the murky history".
Assistant Minister for Social Services and Multicultural Affairs Zed Seselja described it as "five minutes of re-hashed critique to cover for 25-minutes of puff".
But the senator's political opponents on the right weren't the only ones questioning the episode.
Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson said: "Call me cynical, but this Australian Story seems nicely timed to promote Sam's book and his full political comeback".
