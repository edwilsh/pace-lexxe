  <title>Code words such as</title>
  <content>
Motorbikes, parties, weddings and Masterchef were codewords used by would-be terrorists planning an attack on an Australian Federal Police headquarters and the Lithgow Jail.
The six young men used words like "banana" and "motorbike" for guns, "party" for a terror attack, "wombat hole" for their meeting place and "China" for fighting with Islamic State overseas, .
Three men - including Sulayman Khalid, 22, Jibryl Almaouie, 23 and a 16-year-old - each pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit acts in preparation for a terrorist act in the NSW Supreme Court on Monday.
Their plea followed on from Farhad Said, 25, and Mohamed Almaouie, 21, earlier admitted to possessing documents connected with the preparation of a terrorist attack while a sixth man, Ibrahim Ghazzawy, 21, pleaded guilty to possessing documents in 2016.
He was jailed for at least six years and four months.
The release of the code words and the six men's methods of discussing and planning an attack in late 2014 come after Justice Geoffrey Bellow lifted long-standing non-publication orders on the case.
Despite the attempts at codewords to disguise their plans, the men were being monitored by counter-terror investigators who decoded their conversations in text messages, phone calls and even during meetings in what they called their "wombat hole" but was ringleader Khalid's Regents Park garage.

During raids in December 2014, police found several documents in a black suitcase in Khalid's garage.
One note described an attack on an AFP building in the city or Parramatta: "Helicopters and all that so we are going to fight till shahada [an Islamic creed] anyway so we might as well do something major."
Another read: "The plan is gorilla (sic) warfare ... we are going to go to the woods and attack the dogs there, Blue Mountains and the surrounding forests."
A third document identified Lithgow jail as a target.
The four men and the teenager awaiting sentencing will face a three-day hearing in October.
