A Melbourne man has been charged with murder after a 44-year-old man died at a house in the city's west.
The man died just after 8.30pm on Saturday in the suburb of Sunshine West. A 42-year-old woman who was present in the house was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
A 45-year-old local man who was arrested at the time faced an out-of-sessions court hearing and was charged with one count of murder.
He was remanded to appear at Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Monday.
