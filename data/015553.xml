  <title>Man charged over Sydney police pursuits</title>
  <content>
A man allegedly crashed into a police car during a pursuit in Sydney's east.
Police say the driver crashed into the back of the stationery vehicle in the early hours of Friday morning after police tried to pull him over for travelling 55hm/h in a 40km/h zone.
The 43-year-old was arrested at Maroubra after police deployed road spikes, and has since been charged with two counts of police pursuit, one count of driving in a dangerous manner and one count of resisting arrest.
The Botany man was refused bail to appear at Parramatta Local Court on Friday.
