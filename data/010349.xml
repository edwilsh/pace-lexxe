  <title>Porn Harms Kids calls for online material to have age verification measures to protect children</title>
  <content>
A charity is calling on the Federal Government to introduce age verification measures to stop children from accessing pornography websites.
The registered charity, Porn Harms Kids, made the plea following the introduction of legislation in Britain that will next year force online porn users to prove they are adults.
By April 2018, pornography sites in Britain will be forced to verify users' ages via their credit cards to prove they are over 18 or face being banned.
Porn Harms Kids director Tamara Newlands said the Australian Government had a duty of care towards protecting its children from pornography harm.
"Australia should follow suit because viewing pornography can be a form of sexual abuse for children," Ms Newlands said.
"Some of the things that have been seen are mental health issues, trauma, confusion around identity, grooming for sexual abuse, paedophiles, normalisation of abusive behaviour and can also lead to child-on-child sexual abuse," she said.
Ms Newlands said not every child would have a negative response to porn.
"But when we're talking over 80 per cent of pornography being violence-based, most of it is going to be highly traumatic for children."
Ms Newlands said age verification was a digital child protection buffer that had the potential to create a greater level of safety for children.
"All it takes is access to the internet and children have access to pornography and you go to any porn hub page and it's got incest and paedophiles and the images that you are receiving are really quite disturbing," she said.
Ms Newlands said the Government had formed a working online consultation group to investigate options preventing the harms of pornography.
"We think it's great that they're investigating but we need action," she said.
"We need the Government to step in and say, 'yes we will be implementing the age verification process'.
"We don't let children buy alcohol and enter alcoholic stores, we don't let children buy cigarettes, we don't let children enter sex shops and the same needs to provide for pornography."
