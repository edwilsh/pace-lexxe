  <title>Brighton forum backed by Lib MP</title>
  <content>
GOLDSTEIN Federal Liberal MP Tim Wilson will attend a marriage equality forum in his Brighton heartland tonight.
Supporters of the The Equality Campaign are calling for reform to be resolved by a parliamentary vote.
While the openly gay Mr Wilson has said he will not cross the floor to back a Labor same-sex marriage Bill, he holds a clear position backing the principle.
"We should want people to enter committed, long-term relationships,", he told the Leader on July 11.
Local speakers at the forum will include Bayside civil celebrant Bill Stubbs, Hawthorn Football Club Hall of Fame legend Russell Greene, and his daughter Angie, also the founder of Stand Up Events, which advocates against discrimination.
Mr Wilson confirmed yesterday to the Leader he would attend.
Forum organiser Tiernan Brady encouraged people to attend.
He said a recent poll of the Goldstein electorate stated 77 per cent backed marriage equality.
"Civil marriage equality can be resolved tomorrow by a simple vote in parliament and the nation can move forward," Mr Brady said.
The event will be held at the New Bay Hotel, 329 New St, Brighton from 6.30pm.
