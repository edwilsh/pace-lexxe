  <title>Chinese tourists arrested for Hitler salutes in Germany</title>
  <content>
Berlin: German police on Saturday arrested two Chinese tourists for making illegal "Heil Hitler" salutes in front of the historic Reichstag building that houses the German parliament.

They face charges for "using symbols of illegal organisations", the police said in a statement, and were released after posting bail of 500 euros each.

The Reichstag is a powerful symbol in Germany. It was destroyed by fire in 1933 by an arsonist thought to have been paid by the Nazis, who then blamed the blaze on the Communists and used it as an excuse to severely restrict civil liberties.
