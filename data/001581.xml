  <title>Anderson steady in rankings</title>
  <content>
Philippa Anderson and Ryan Callinan

Merewether's Philippa Anderson held onto 11th spot on the World Surf League qualifying series with a round-six exit at the Supergirl Pro at Oceanside Pier, California, on Monday (AEST).

Anderson was comboed in a 16.17 to 9.96 loss to Brazilian championship tour veteran Silvana Lima, who she had defeated in round four of the 6000-point QS event.
The 1550 points gained kept Anderson 11th on the rankings as she chases a top-six finish to break onto the CT for the first time. She is 1200 short of sixth on the standings, which take into account surfers' best five performances.
Merewether clubmate Ryan Callinan continues his men's QS charge at Huntington Beach against Australian young gun Ethan Ewing, Brazilian Samuel Pupo and Peru's Miguel Tudela in round six of the 10,000-point US Open of Surfing. The event was up to round five on Monday. Callinan, a CT competitor in 2016, is 43rd on the QS after surfing in only three events this year.
Meanwhile, Port Stephens' Mitch Dawkins backed up victory in the over-35 division with a strong start in the over-40s at the Surfmasters national titles at Duranbah Beach on Monday.

Dawkins, the defending champion, won his opening over-40s heat with 16.25  in tricky, wind-blown peaks. Newcastle's Paul Snow, who made the over-35 final, was another opening heat winner.

Swansea's Glenn Valaire starred in the over-50s, racking up a 18-point total in his opening heat. His single scores of 9.25 and 8.75 were the highest of the event.
