  <title>Why this 'vulgar' photo caused a huge backlash</title>
  <content>
ALIYA Shagieva is a young mother who just wants to look after her baby.

She's also the youngest daughter of Almazbek Atambayev, the president of Kyrgyzstan - a conservative Muslim-majority country in Central Asia.

The 20-year-old shared a photo of herself breastfeeding her son in her underwear, with the caption: "I will feed my child whenever and wherever he needs to be fed."

The image caused a severe backlash.

Aliya was accused of being "immoral" and "vulgar", and the trolling became so severe she was eventually forced to remove it altogether.

However, she's holding her head high and using the debate to launch an attack on a culture she says is hyper-sexualising the female body.

"This body I've been given is not vulgar. It is functional, its purpose is to fulfil the physiological needs of my baby, not to be sexualised," she told the .

"When I'm breastfeeding my child I feel like I'm giving him the best I can give. Taking care of my baby and attending to his needs is more important to me than what people say about me."

While it is acceptable to breastfeed in public in Kyrgyszstan, women are typically required to cover themselves and their baby with a cloth.

Victoria Tahmasebi, a Canadian gender studies expert, tweeted: "From a capitalist view point women's breasts can create profit as long as they are sexualised. Breastfeeding in public makes women's breasts less sexy, therefore it is not acceptable."

Even Ms Shagieva's parents, the country's President and First Lady, disapproved.

"They really didn't like it. And it is understandable because the younger generation is less conservative than their parents," she said.

The artist is known for being socially progressive - giving birth just six months after her marriage to a Russian man, and maintaining a vegetarian diet despite the fact that meat is a staple in the ex-Soviet country.

She has at least 32,000 followers on Instagram, and her carefully composed images focusing on family life have been shared around the world.

However, she insists she's not trying to make a political statement.

Rather, she's simply trying to normalise women's bodies and break the taboos surrounding something they've been doing since the beginning of time.
