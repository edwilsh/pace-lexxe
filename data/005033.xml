  <title>YMCA leased buildings in Melbourne's south-east sell for $12.4 million</title>

Two swim schools and a childcare centre in Melbourne's south-east have sold for a combined $12.4 million.
The Kingswim swim school centre in Narre Warren together with a Happy Days childcare centre, both leased to the YMCA on long 15-year leases with two 10-year options, sold to a Chinese investor for $7 million.
Fitzroys' agent James Lockwood, who sold the property with David Bourke and Chris James, said the deal reflected a combined yield of 6 per cent.
Specialised assets with long-term leases were in high demand attracting between 70 and 100 inquiries, he said.
"The excellent lease covenants from national operators along with strong underlying land values form an attractive investment opportunity," Mr Lockwood said.
Mr Lockwood said the Narre Warren transaction followed the sale of another Kingswim school centre at 2 St Catherines Court in Mornington which exchanged to another investor for $5.4 million.
The property on Mornington-Tyabb Road included an indoor swimming pool, commercial offices and call centre.
That property fetched a yield of 6.5 per cent with a similar leasing structure in place.
