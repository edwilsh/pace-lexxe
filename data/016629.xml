PEOPLE should expect nightmare peak-hour commutes on the M5 motorway after an overheight truck struck the tunnel entrance of the M5 East.
Extreme delays are expected for those travelling towards the city this afternoon.
M5 East closed eastbound lanes but they have now been reopened, according to Live Traffic NSW. The truck was moved shortly after the incident.
The truck hit the tunnel entrance at Bexley North before 5.30pm and there is currently heavy traffic.
More to come.
