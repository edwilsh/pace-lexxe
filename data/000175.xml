  <title>Australian model Michelle Leslie detained at LA airport</title>
  <content>
Lingerie model Michelle Leslie has been filmed being escorted away by an airport official shortly after arriving at Los Angeles with partner and musician Daniel Johns yesterday.
Leslie, 36, reportedly encountered a problem while attempting to check in at an automated passport kiosk, which resulted in her being detained.
Leslie and Johns, of Silverchair fame, were filmed kissing briefly before she was escorted away. It is not currently known whether Leslie remains in US immigration custody.
Leslie was previously arrested and jailed in Bali's notorious Kerobokan Jail for the possession of two ecstasy pills in 2005.
The couple shared a photo of the pair together to Instagram in May, appearing to confirm their relationship.
It came just months after a shirtless Johns was photographed collapsing in the street after leaving a bar in Sydney's Double Bay in December last year.
