There has been a spike in last-minute registrations for this weekend's Avon Descent with veteran paddlers saying river conditions are the best they have seen in decades.
More than 300 people are set take part the two-day event, covering 124 kilometres in crafts ranging from kayaks to power boats.

Josh Kippin placed first in the kayak singles last year while best mate Brendan Rice was runner up.
The pair have put aside their friendly rivalry and have teamed up for the relay event.
They will also head to South Africa in September, representing Australia in the kayak marathon world championships.
Mr Kippin, 26, said
"We spent a lot of hours there learning any short cuts and know all the water levels ... but it was an eye opener for me because it's the first time we've done them since we've had those floods," he said.
"The floods that we had earlier this year have actually changed the normal lines quite a lot."
"The ti trees are the section where you make the most impact on your race."
Numbers down despite river levels

The Shire of Northam's Ross Rayson said thousands of people were attending fireworks and a street parade on the riverbank on Friday night.
He said it was great for local businesses.
"They're all open later tonight and the last couple of years they've done really well, so from an economic point of view it's really good," he said.
But despite the ideal conditions, registrations are down to 370, compared with 530 last year.
Event organisers say despite recent rainfall, a dry winter meant fewer registrations.
Graeme Birkett has been volunteering for the event since he moved to Northam in 1996.
He spent today checking hundreds of life jackets.
Mr Birkett said competitor numbers varied from year to year.
"A lot of it depends on the weather, a good river the numbers come up, and a bad one everyone doesn't want to tackle the tough [conditions]," he said.
