36 Needham St, Fig Tree Pocket

The founder of collapsed Linc Energy Peter Bond has failed to sell his prestige waterfront mansion at auction with the property passing in at $9.25 million.
Known as Rivergum Retreat, the seven-bedroom, nine-bathroom pad at, was purchased by Bond in November 2009 for $9.5 million.
Since Linc Energy went into receivership last year with debts of more than $300 million, Bond has been trying to offload his property.

The property had been previously listed with other elite Brisbane agents including the principal of Adcock Prestige - Brisbane, Jason Adcock and Tyson Clarke of Queensland Sotheby's International Realty - Ascot who had it listed for $11.9 million.
With six registered bidders on board, about 70 people attended yesterday's auction including neighbours and other high profile Brisbane agents.
