  <content>
Police will search an area of bushland south west of Sydney in the ongoing quest to find the body of 12-year-old schoolgirl Quanne Diec, allegedly murdered almost two decades ago.
The three-day search of dense bushland off Appin Road at Cataract starts on Monday, following an earlier investigation in Bulli Tops in 2016 which failed to locate her body.Photo: Supplied
A 49-year-old man was charged with her murder in November 2016.
Officers from Rosehill Local Area Command and the Forensic Services Group will conduct the search into the possible location of Quanne's body.
The student went missing on July 27, 1998 after leaving her Granville home to catch the train to Strathfield Girls' High School.
Police combed an address in Granville in the search for Quanne's remains in 2016 before continuing their search at Bulli Tops, east of Cataract.
