  <title>Near miss for jets at San Fran airport</title>
  <content>
Newly released photos show just how close an Air Canada jet came to crashing into other planes as it tried to land in San Francisco last month.
As the Air Canada jet streaked toward a taxiway at San Francisco International Airport, it was as low as 59 feet (18 meters) above ground.
That's barely taller than four planes that were on that taxiway and waiting to take off.
Pilots in one of the planes alerted air traffic controllers about the off-course jet.
The crew of another plane switched on its landing lights in an apparent last-ditch danger signal.
The Air Canada pilots pulled up and flew over the other planes just in time.
Federal officials released the photos and new details about the July 7 incident on Wednesday.
