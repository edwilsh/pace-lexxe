  <title>China sets yuan at 9-1/2 month high</title>
  <content>
China's central bank has set the yuan midpoint at 6.7148 per US dollar, the strongest level since October 11 2016, reflecting broad weakness in the US currency.
Tuesday's official guidance was 135 pips or 0.2 per cent firmer than the previous fix at 6.7283 per dollar.
The dollar weakened in the overseas markets, as uncertainty over the US political outlook heightened after the firing of White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci.
The global dollar index, a gauge that measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, hit its lowest since early May 2016 after the news of Scaramucci's departure.
