  <title>Gym proves a hub for athletes</title>
  <content>
FITNESS: The Sunshine Coast is fast becoming the mecca for state and national squads fine-tuning their performances ahead of competition.
The region has played host to the Maroons plus numerous AFL and NRL squads in the past, with the South Australian Redbacks cricket side currently enjoying the warmer winter climate.
The Base Gym at Twin Waters is the latest drawcard for the top athletes, with the location already hosting the Richmond and Carlton AFL teams in its first 12 months of operation.
Owner Ray Carson said plans were also being finalised for the gym to host the Scottish Commonwealth games weightlifting team.
The gym is managed by Core Strength Fitness' Brendan Wilkins and includes cargo nets, climbing ropes, tyres, atlas stones and almost 40,000kg of weights.
Carson said Twin Waters Resort was already popular among the sporting elite and he wanted to create a hub for visiting sides to train.
His military background heavily influenced the gym's design.
"The way we used to train in the military is you'd get up in the morning and you'd do PT in a paddock and everything was outdoors and functional and it worked," he said.
He built the gym himself at Xperiences HQ, and said a big attraction was exercising outside.
"You're training with a backdrop that is bushland and kookaburras are singing and with the occasional kangaroo hopping past, you can't beat that," he said.
"There's nothing like this gym that I know of in Australia."
