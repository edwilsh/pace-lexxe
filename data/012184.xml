  <title>Tour to rise out of the Ashes after pay deal</title>
  <content>
CRICKET: Australian cricket has finally signed off on a new landmark pay deal, ending a bitter and drawn-out saga that's lasted nearly 10 months.
The Ashes has been saved and Steve Smith will lead his team to Bangladesh later this month for two Tests.
Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers' Association came to an agreement on key issues early in the week but the process of signing off on the deal took longer than expected, with both parties going back and forth over wordings and minor matters.
Originally it was hoped there would be an announcement on Tuesday or Wednesday.
CA chief executive James Sutherland (pictured) and his ACA counterpart Alistair Nicholson were set for a press conference in Melbourne late yesterday.
The anticipation is that players have retained a revenue share model, even if it has been altered to give CA more financial stability.
Grassroots and back pay are the other key points in the agreement.
