  <title>'Man with scissors' caught at CBD station</title>
  <content>
A man allegedly armed with a pair of scissors has been arrested at Sydney's Central Station.
Police say the man entered a shop at Henry Deane Plaza at 8.30am on Wednesday, then closed the door and pulled out the scissors.
A staff member inside managed to contact police, who quickly arrived at the scene and arrested the man "without incident", a NSW Police spokesman told AAP.
The alleged offender was taken to Day Street Police Station for questioning.
The arrest comes a week after police shot dead 30-year-old Danukul Mokmool at Central Station, who was also armed with a pair of scissors.
