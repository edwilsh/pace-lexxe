  <title>Croc number explosion: Salties invade cane drains</title>
  <content>
CROCODILES seem to be -increasingly becoming workplace hazards for the Far North's cane farmers.

A Gordonvale farmer snapped this photo of a healthy-sized saltwater croc sunning itself on the bank of a drain on his property near Mt Sapphire, south of Cairns, this week.

Division 1 Councillor Brett Moller believed the croc had swum upstream from a nearby creek into the drain, which separates two cane paddocks.

"I guess it shows that crocodile numbers are so great, they're forcing smaller crocs into waterways where they never used to be," he said.

"It is unacceptable that we are finding them in drains through cane farms. These are not the animals' natural place."
