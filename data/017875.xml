A magnitude 5.8 earthquake has struck south Mindanao island in the Philippines, the US Geological Survey said.
The quake's epicentre was 34km east of the city of General Santos, which has a population of almost 600,000.
The USGS said the quake was 74km deep, but European quake agency EMSC put it at only 10km deep, which would increase its impact.
The temblor, initially reported as a magnitude 6.0, struck at 8:30am on Saturday.
A magnitude 5.8 earthquake is considered moderate and is capable of causing considerable damage.
