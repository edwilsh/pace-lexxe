  <title>HIA says new homes sales fall sharply in June</title>
  <content>
Sales of new homes fell sharply in June to the lowest since 2013, though conditions were markedly different across states, an industry survey showed on Monday.
The Housing Industry Association (HIA) said its survey of large-volume builders showed new home sales fell a seasonally adjusted 6.9 percent in June, from May, reversing two months of gains.Photo: Rob Homer
Sales of detached houses fell 5.7 per cent, while apartment sales dropped 10.7 per cent.
Total sales in June were down 11.9 per cent on the same month last year.
Results by states were mixed, with sales of houses falling in NSW, South Australia and Queensland, but rising in Victoria and Western Australia.
HIA said the survey captured 9 per cent of Australia's new home building sector.
