Newcastle triathlete Aaron Royle is expected next week to be named in the Australian team for September's season-ending race in Rotterdam.

The 2017 ITU World Series Triathlon grand final in the Netherlands next month would be Royle's fifth straight senior decider and it comes as the 27-year-old looks to qualify for the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast in April. 

The Rio Olympian will hope to emulate his seventh-placed performances at the same 2013 London and 2015 Chicago events to help convince national selectors he's completed his comeback from a foot injury suffered in February.

It will be one of his last chances to post results before the Triathlon Australia nomination period finishes in three months.
There's also the upcoming international round in Montreal on Sunday, later this month in Stockholm and potentially November in Noosa, where he has won twice before.  
"It's my first time in Montreal and I've heard it's a pretty spectacular race with huge crowds" Royle told Triathlon Australia media.
"I'm feeling more comfortable each time I get on the start line this year, so I am gaining confidence and Montreal gives me another opportunity for that."
Two of the three Australian men's positions for the Gold Coast are now discretionary with in-form Jake Birtwhistle having already nabbed an automatic spot.

Royle and co. missed the second automatic position available in Hamburg last month. He finished 25th when top-10 was required and wasn't used in the World Teams Relay, where Australia won gold via Birtwhistle, 19-year-old Matthew Hauser, Ashleigh Gentle and Charlotte McShane.

Royle was 16th in Edmonton last week. Birtwhistle claimed silver.
"Slight improvement on Hamburg, but still a ways to be back where I want to be. Keep working," he posted on Twitter on Monday.

Ryan Bailie, Royle's bronze-medal winning teammate from the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games along with Emma Moffatt and Emma Jackson, has yet to return from a recent calf injury.

Royle, who trains alongside the illustrious Brownlee brothers in the English city of Leeds, will be joined in Montreal this weekend by fellow Australian male competitors Kenji Nener, Declan Wilson and Luke Willian.

The Australian women's contingent for Canada will be down Jackson but led by Commonwealth Games qualifier, Rio Olympian and Gold Coast native Gentle. McShane, Natalie Van Coevorden, Emma Jeffcoat and Gillian Backhouse round out the female group to race Saturday.
