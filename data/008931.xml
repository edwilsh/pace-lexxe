  <title>Coleman to step down at Hamilton</title>
  <content>
DEPARTING: Scott Coleman will not coach the Hawks in 2018.

HAMILTON have begun the unenviable task of finding a replacement for first-grade coach Scott Coleman.
Coleman has informed the club that he is taking a break in 2018.

"We bought an old place that we are going to knock down and rebuild," Coleman said. "Hopefully that will kick off in September-October and will tie me up all pre-season. I won't be able to do first grade."
Coleman leaves big shoes to fill. In 2014, when he coached in Italy, is the only season the Hawks haven't contested the grand final since 2010. They are chasing a record third straight premiership.

"I definitely don't want to make the season about me," he said. "I have called it twice before and they haven't found anyone." 

The Hawks have advertised for all coaching positions.
"We put it out early, hoping we get some applicants in the next few weeks," Coleman said. "If we get any suitable contenders we will invite them to training and show them how we do things at present."
