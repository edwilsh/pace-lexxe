"Can I be upfront, I have not had one single person come up to me and raise with me any concerns about the decision that my government took," Ms Palaszczuk said.
Mr Chien did not rule out taking legal action as a result of the project's demise, but Ms Palaszczuk said the state had the right to terminate under the process deed at any stage.

"We listened to the community, I pride myself in listening to Queenslanders. I listened to to the community and we made a decision," she said.

Ms Palaszczuk said she walked past the $1 billion Jewel residential development and the workers said they would be employed for the next year.
"Of course, we are going to see more and more development happening here on the Coast," she said.
"My government supports that development, but what we know about the Spit, is very clearly, it is iconic to Queensland, it is iconic to the Gold Coast, and I want to see that area transformed into beautiful parklands with storey limits, within the city plan."
Ms Palaszczuk said she was working with the Gold Coast's city leaders to ensure the region had a bright future.
