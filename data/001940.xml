  <title>Centenarian becomes world's oldest tandem skydiver</title>
  <content>
A 102-year-old US man has leaped into the record books, becoming the oldest ever person to make a tandem skydive.
Kenneth Meyer from New Jersey jumped from 10,000 feet in front of an audience including his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren.
His effort surpasses the previous record holder, a 101-year-old British man who claimed it in May.
"I can't believe it to tell you the truth," Mr Meyer told ABC7NY.
"It was awesome."
Mr Meyer said he would consider taking the plunge again for his 105th birthday.
