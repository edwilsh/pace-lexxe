  <title>Homes near Athens in path of brush fire</title>
  <content>
Greek authorities have ordered the evacuation of dozens of homes in two communities south of the capital because of a brush fire fanned by strong winds.
About 40 firefighters, 20 fire trucks and two water-dropping helicopters are battling the fire, which broke out in Lagonissi, a coastal area 30km from Athens with homes scattered across land plots.
"The situation is difficult," regional mayor Yorgos Sofronis told state television, adding that the fire was burning between residences. "The winds are strong."
Three firemen were lightly injured in the blaze and two trucks suffered damage, a fire brigade official said. Summer wildfires are common in Greece. Hundreds died in 2007 during the most serious outbreak in decades.
