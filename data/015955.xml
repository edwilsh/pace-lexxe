UPDATE, 1.55PM: A Queensland Police Service spokesman said patrons were being treated for minor injuries.

"We believe an elderly female lost control of the car," he said.

"It has knocked about three people off their chairs that may have been sitting outside.

"Nobody is seriously injured.

"The lady driver is being treated for a bit of shock.

"The three people hit may have experienced a bit of bruising but nobody is seriously injured.

"It appears she hit the accelerator instead of the brakes."
