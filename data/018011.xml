  <title>Dr Mark glad to be back in Coffs</title>
  <content>
FOR more than 30 years, Dr Mark Mowat has been taking care of the dental health of Coffs locals.
After a two year break, Mark is back, and looking forward to reacquainting himself with new and old patients.
At Coffs Dentist, Mark covers all aspects of general dental practice: check-ups, cleans, implants, crown and bridgework.
"I'm really pleased to be back in Coffs, and I'm really looking forward to seeing everyone again," Mark said.
"Getting to know my patients is one of the best aspects of my job, so I am really enjoying being back."
Mark says giving his patients the smile they want and getting them out of pain is a very satisfying part of his job, as is educating people that a healthy lifestyle and good oral health is essential to your everyday wellbeing.
"Experience is something that cannot be taught," he says. "It takes a long time to get that balance right and give you the confidence and ability to treat any problem or issue that patients present with.
