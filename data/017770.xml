, sold $100,000 beyond reserve on Saturday, July 29.

AN auction result in Highett has suggested Bayside properties with price tags below $1 million will draw buyers in big numbers.
Charlton King Real Estate director Kylie Charlton said a three-bedroom townhouse at 1/12 Jillian Ave, Highett, soared $100,000 beyond reserve, after quoting $850,000-$920,000.
It was snapped up for $1.02 million.
"The auction was a bit of madness," Ms King said.
"We had five strong bidders, and the property was sold after 25 bids."

Ms King said around 110 groups inspected the home, and attributed the strong interest to the sub-$1 million price point.
"And even though it sold above that, it was the buyers that took it there."
She said the vendor's reserve was $920,000.
Ms King said a couple of bidders stretched themselves beyond their limits considerably, which she said was a reflection of the lack of homes on the market.
"People are eager to buy," she said.
She said the home was bought by an investor, who she expected would land bank and sell the home again in the future.
"They're very confident about ongoing price growth in Bayside," she said.
