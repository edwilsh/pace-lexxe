  <title>Labor leader queries privatised power</title>
  <content>
Labor leader Bill Shorten says the privatisation of electricity generators has contributed to higher power prices.
Mr Shorten was asked in the Labor caucus meeting on Monday about the opposition's approach to energy providers, as power bills soar across the country.
He told the meeting Labor was pushing for export controls on gas and acknowledged the privatisation of generators has been a "contributor".
