  <title>Surgeon aims to cut through race field</title>

HE'S finished second in the past two Targa Tasmania rallies, now Hobart surgeon Mike Pritchard hopes to be as competitive on the water.
With his 600-horsepower Dodge Viper tarmac rally beast parked in the garage, Pritchard has been working hard to set up his new ride - the 2013 Sydney-Hobart handicap winner Victoire - for his 2017 race campaign.
Now called Oskana, Pritchard's Farr-Cookson 50 will be crewed by locals, including possibly wife Bianca, his father-in-law Colin Langham, and Michael Hutchinson (boat captain), Jason Wilkie (navigator), Stephen McCullum, Jack McCullum, Matt Clougher, Stuart Beltz, Patrick Copeland and Sam Tiedemann.
Pritchard and company have been tuning their 50-footer over the winter months.
"We have been sailing every week up until recently, when the mast came out to be serviced and the rod rigging replaced," Pritchard said. "There were many sails that came with the boat, so we've been looking at all of them as we go.
"We did a night sail during Dark Mofo, which ended up being slightly eerie with the red glow all over the city."
Mike and Bianca claimed second in ORCi division three when they raced their yacht Audere in the 2014 Sydney-Hobart and hope for another outstanding performance in the 73rd edition of the race starting on Boxing Day.
"If the weather pattern falls in her favour, she can finish top 10 again, but we won't have an opportunity to test ourselves against the competition beforehand," Pritchard said.
"At the moment, all we can do is sail to our numbers and practice our crew work."
Michael Crew's 62-footer Magic Miles, from the Bellerive Yacht Club, is the only other Tasmanian yacht entered so far.
