Eddie Betts is racing the clock to be ready for Sunday's Showdown

ADELAIDE star Eddie Betts faces a last-minute fitness test before he's cleared to play in Sunday's Showdown against Port Adelaide at Adelaide Oval.

The electric small forward has been named in the Crows' extended 25-man squad to take on the Power after having his appendix removed early last week.

It appears he will be included in the final 22 to be confirmed on Friday afternoon, before being put through his paces at a closed training session on Saturday morning.

"I've got a test tomorrow," Betts told radio station Five AA.

"We train tomorrow, I'll go through a little test and we'll see from there."

Adelaide's thrilling draw with Collingwood last week was the first game Betts has missed since joining the Crows in 2014.
