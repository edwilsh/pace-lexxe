She certainly doesn't look like she flies through the bush in a Datsun at almost 100km/h.
But information management specialist and rally driver Lynda Leigh, 46, is more than happy for you to think that. She gave up doing what was expected and being "normal" about six years ago.Photo: Rohan Thomson
"Life is way too short," she said.
"I lost my mother and grandmother in a very short period, six years ago, and when there's a huge change in your life, you reassess.Photo: Rohan Thomson
"Normal was just too hard - it's like that old saying, 'why be normal when you can be yourself?'
"So I started accepting who I was and that I could be doing a shitload more with my life."

That "shitload more" now includes the realisation of a long-term dream - giving her own TED talk.

Lynda is one of 12 speakers who'll take the stage of Canberra Theatre next month for TEDx Canberra - the local version of the global TED (Technology Entertainment Design) talk phenomenon.
In a talk entitled Drive like a girl, she wants to make sure that Canberrans actually never, ever use that insult again.
"I'm going to do things a little differently, and what will appear on stage is something you've probably not seen before," she said.
"And probably not even thought about before. I'm looking forward to having a one-on-one conversation with every single person in that audience.
"It'll be a bit about inspiration and a lot about safety."
While she started out as a co-driver for partner and former national rally driving champion David Stephens in 2014, Lynda said her frustration in the passenger seat led her to actually try being the driver.
"My partner was a national champion driver and he asked me - very romantically - 'will you be my co-driver?' about three years ago," Lynda said.
"So I started co-driving for him and I couldn't understand why things had to be done a certain way - as a rally co-driver you manage the time, you manage the service crew, the meal breaks, how much fuel you have and it's all about the analytics.
"But when I started driving everything just clicked. Now I get it."
Lynda was hooked. She bought her own rally car, a bright orange 1980 Datsun Stanza she lovingly named Kumquat.
"Why Kumquat? Cause it's not a lemon," she laughed.
"And I know Kumquat's a girl because she has a purple head gasket."
Lynda placed second in the novice section of the 2016 ACT Regional Rally Series and said rally driving had changed her approach to "street" driving so much that she now refers to herself as "old" and "new" Lynda.
"I was doing my Monday morning drive to Canberra from Bega recently and I nearly hit a kangaroo," she said.
"If it had have been old Lynda driving, she would not be here to tell this story. She would have braked, she would have gone off the road and she would have hit a tree at 100km/h.
"But post-rallying Lynda had the sense to brake gently and hold the line - there's a saying in rally driving: 'if in doubt, power out' and that's what I did."
Born with a congenital ear problem that now means she's 90 per cent deaf, Lynda wants the learner driver process to include an entire section on car maintenance, especially for girls.
"When I learnt how to drive, my dad didn't teach me car maintenance - he said 'if you get a flat just stand by the road my darling and somebody will change it for you'.
"I look back now and that's bad advice.
"There's this big thing now of 'oh let's be independent women' but how many women know how to put air in their tyres? How many women don't even know how to check their oil?
"You don't know what you don't know, and sometimes that can be fatal."
