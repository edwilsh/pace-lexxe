It's look increasingly unlikely that Scott Pendlebury will play again this year

COLLINGWOOD has virtually ruled out skipper Scott Pendlebury and speedster Travis Varcoe for the remainder of the year after both had surgery last week. 

Pendlebury had a second operation on his broken finger while Varcoe's dislocated elbow also needed an operation. 

Magpies football manager Geoff Walsh told the club website that time might be against the pair returning before the end of the season. 

"While their surgery went well, Scott and Travis are both (expected to miss) multiple weeks and we won't know whether they will return before the end of the year or not for a few weeks yet," Walsh said.
"Right now, it's looking like time might run out for both those boys." 

The Pies are also likely to be without big-bodied midfielder Rupert Wills again for this week's game against North Melbourne at Etihad Stadium due to a quad injury that forced him to miss last Sunday's draw with Adelaide.

Wills was impressive against West Coast in his only senior game for 2017 having battled soft tissue injuries for most of the year.

Meanwhile, father-son prospect Josh Daicos should be available for selection in the VFL against Werribee on Saturday after his foot was stood on against Essendon at Victoria Park last Sunday.

Daicos was an emergency for the senior team and was forced from the ground early in the game against the Bombers.
