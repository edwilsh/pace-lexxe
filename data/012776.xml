  <title>Corrupt MP's operated in secret: Keneally</title>
  <content>
Former NSW premier Kristina Keneally says three ministers in her government found to have engaged in corrupt conduct did so "in secret".
An Independent Commission Against Corruption report, released on Thursday, found then-Labor MPs Eddie Obeid, Joe Tripodi and Tony Kelly engaged in serious corrupt conduct between 2007 and 2010.
ICAC found the trio, and senior staffer Gilbert "Laurie" Brown, acted corruptly in relation to a lucrative public-private partnership proposal by controversial water infrastructure company Australian Water Holding.
Ms Keneally on Thursday stressed that she shut down the prospect of the suspect PPP when it came across her desk.
"The ICAC report lays out the extent to which Obeid, Tripodi and Kelly operated in secret in their failed attempt to undermine my government's cabinet process," Ms Keneally said on Twitter.
"The ICAC report also makes clear that, despite the various attempts by Obeid, Tripodi and Kelly to lobby me, their efforts failed when I ordered the AWH cabinet minute withdrawn."
Thursday's report made no adverse findings against Liberal party members -including federal senator Arthur Sinodinos - who was the deputy chairman of AWH between 2009 and 2010.
The Liberal senator stepped down from the front bench in March 2014 when he was drawn into the inquiry - but was reinstated 18 months later.
Senator Sinodinos on Thursday said it was the end of "a long and comprehensive process".
NSW Labor leader Luke Foley distanced himself from the three former ministers saying authorities should "throw the book at them".
"Nothing tells you more about the change in the Labor Party than the fact that I'm the party's leader - because I'm the fella that took them on inside the party for decades."
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian used Thursday's findings to attack the state opposition.
"This is yet another example of the way the former Labor government held the people of NSW in contempt and ran the state to line its own pockets," she said in a statement.
The premier in question time noted many current Labor MPs were in government when the three ministers were working "for their own political and financial interests".
