  <title>Body blow for Rossdog as back injury ends his season | photos</title>

NEWCASTLE will be without their leading tryscorer, fullback Nathan Ross, for the rest of the NRL season after he suffered a broken bone in his back in Saturday's win against the Warriors.

Ross fielded a kick in the 49th minute and, as he bent over to gather up the ball, was hit from behind by Warriors centre Blake Ayshford.
Ayshford's knee appeared to strike Ross right in the middle of his back and Newcastle's No.1 immediately screamed in pain.
After a lengthy delay for treatment, he was helped off the field. 
Once he crossed the sideline, he lay down and was eventually taken from the playing arena on a medicab.
The 28-year-old crowd favourite, who has scored 10 tries in 18 games this season, was rushed to hospital, where X-rays confirmed a fracture of the L1 transverse process, which will require surgery.
The recovery time frame is likely to be six to eight weeks, and Newcastle have only four games left this season.
The City Origin representative thanked his fans on Twitter, adding: "I am devastated about this but will be back." He told the Newcastle Herald the setback has "broken my heart".
Knights coach Nathan Brown said he had no concerns about the incident that left Ross injured.
"I'd have thought it was definitely an accident,'' Brown said. "He's not that type of player, Blake Ayshford.
"He plays the game pretty fair."
After Ross's departure, versatile Peter Mata'utia switched to fullback, and his brother Sione moved from back row to left-side centre.
Brown also has the option of using Queensland Origin star Dane Gagai as fullback.
While the loss of the Ross, who has made more attacking metres than any Knights player this year, is a blow, Newcastle are likely to welcome back new recruit Shaun Kenny-Dowall (hamstring) for Friday's clash with Parramatta at ANZ Stadium.
