  <title>City council to weigh into Australia Day debate</title>
  <content>
ADELAIDE City Councillors will next week join the contentious debate about whether to move the traditional date for Australia Day celebrations.
At the Australian Local Government Association's National General Assembly in June, the Hobart City Council moved to encourage Australian councils to "consider efforts they could take to lobby the Federal Government to change the date of recognition of Australia Day".
January 26 marks the anniversary of the 1788 arrival of the First Fleet and is regarded by many indigenous Australians as 'Invasion Day'.
Thirty-seven South Australian councils attended the national general assembly, with a majority of attendees voting in support of the Hobart City Council.
Adelaide City Councillor Alex Antic, who said he was disappointed by the decision to back the Hobart Council motion and will move his own motion for his own council to come to a position on the issue at a meeting next Tuesday.
"Australia Day is a day for all Australians to celebrate the things which make our country great," Mr Antic told The Advertiser.
"This week I will ask the Adelaide City Council to instruct the Lord Mayor to write to the Prime Minister, and the ALGA, to indicate that the City of Adelaide wants the date of Australia Day to remain the 26th of January, and to express concern regarding their recent resolution," he said.
"I hope that position is supported by my colleagues."
