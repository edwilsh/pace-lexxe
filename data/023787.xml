The new facilities were announced in the Brisbane City Council .
Lord Mayor Graham Quirk said his river plan was designed to enhance tourism and lifestyle options, by providing convenient locations to jump aboard Moreton Bay and Island cruises, hop-on hop-off city-sights tours, water-taxis and leisure craft.Photo: Brisbane City Council
"New Farm Park and the City Botanic Gardens are two of the five inner-city docking sites that will be built, followed by West End and two river-front locations at South Bank," Cr Quirk said.
"These will be complemented by five river lifestyle hubs in the suburban reaches of the Brisbane River, including at Dutton Park."Photo: Brisbane City Council
The hubs built at New Farm Park and the City Botanic Gardens will have mooring facilities for several vessels, including a separate space for leisure and commercial vehicles.
