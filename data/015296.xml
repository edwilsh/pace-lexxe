A man arrested over an alleged carjacking of a luxury car in Canberra's south yesterday will remain behind bars after he was refused bail.
Ashley Brian Figura, 23, is one of three men police believe was involved in a violent carjacking of a distinctive red Ford Mustang in Yarralumla.
He has been charged with dangerous driving after a dramatic incident when police said they tried to arrest him at a petrol station,
Court documents allege he drove at police before escaping.
The car was recovered yesterday afternoon in Manuka and the ACT Magistrates Court heard Figura was later caught and arrested.
Police said they had seen Figura on CCTV getting out of the car.
But Figura told the court he had never driven a red Mustang.
He applied for bail, saying he would live under supervision at his mother's house.
But police told the court they feared Figura may interfere with their investigation, after he made threats against a possible witness, calling him a "dog" and threatening to "get him".
Police also told the court the matter was tied up in an investigation into IGA robberies in the area and they were still looking for two other men driving a white Volkswagen.
He will be back in court later this month.
