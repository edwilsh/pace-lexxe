  <title>Trinity Bay State High flying flag for community pride</title>
  <content>
FOR the first time in Trinity Bay State High School's 57-year history the Australian, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islands flags were raised together at the school's gates.
Trinity Bay's community education counsellor Damon Leftwich said the start of the school's NAIDOC week celebrations yesterday were the perfect time to debut the flags.
He said a Year 7 maths class were solving a geometry problem using the flagpole and wondered aloud why only the Australian flag was flown.
"There was a lot of pride among the students and the staff when the flags were raised," he said.
"It's not just Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-indigenous students at the school, we have many from all over the world who come to study here."
Malakai Oui was one of the Year 7 students behind the new flags and said they made him feel happy.
