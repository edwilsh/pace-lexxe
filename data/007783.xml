  <title>Melbourne weather: Plane misses approach at airport due to fog</title>
  <content>
Melbourne's  morning pea-soup fog is so thick a pilot had to pull out of their descent on a flight into Melbourne Airport.
A Virgin Australia flight  from Canberra was heading  into Melbourne Airport when the pilot decided the fog was too heavy to land. They were forced to pull the Boeing 737 out of the landing. The flight was then diverted to Sydney. Photo: Justin McManus
A Virgin Australia spokeswoman said the "missed approach" was routine and did not pose a risk to customers.Photo: Justin McManus
Several other flights across numerous airlines have also been delayed, and one Qantas flight had to be diverted. Flights continue to arrive and depart at the airport.
The fog is thick across Melbourne, with many social media users posting snaps of obscured landmarks.
