  <title>Two charged after shopping centre bomb hoax</title>
  <content>
POLICE have charged two men after a Rockhampton shopping centre was allegedly threatened with a bomb.
The shopping centre on Yamba Rd was evacuated yesterday morning when a threatening call was allegedly made to staff at a business in the centre.
Another call was also allegedly made to staff at a service station in Allenstown,
Police were able to determine that threats were unsubstantiated.
Two Gracemere men, aged 24 and 26, have since been charged with two counts each of bomb hoax and are expected to front Rockhampton Magistrates court today.
Those convicted of making a bomb threat could face up to five years jail time.
