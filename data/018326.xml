  <title>Eddie's ready: Betts cleared for epic Showdown</title>

Eddie Betts has been cleared to face Port Adelaide on Sunday

SUPERSTAR Adelaide forward Eddie Betts will face Port Adelaide in Sunday's Showdown after he completed training on Saturday morning.

Betts, 30, had his appendix taken out just under a fortnight ago and had his streak of 100 consecutive games broken when he missed the draw with Collingwood. 

Adelaide assistant coach David Teague confirmed to reporters on Saturday morning that Betts was set to take the field. 

"He went well. He got through training so we're very confident that he'll line up tomorrow," Teague said. 

While training the day before a game is usually a light session, Teague said Betts had proven he could cope with more physical work. 

"He's done contact (work) during the week. We did match sim type stuff on our main training session and he got through that no worries," he said.

"Then he did a little bit extra today, and as long as he pulls up alright tomorrow, I'm pretty confident that he'll be out there." 

Meanwhile, Brad Crouch (fractured cheekbone) and Jake Lever (hamstring) are both set to take on the Power in a clash that has top-four ramifications. 

The Crows entered the round a game clear at the top of the ladder while the Power was fifth and win behind fourth-placed Richmond. 

Crouch trained with a helmet during the week but Teague was "not sure" if the tough midfielder would don the headwear on Sunday.
