Authorities have warned it could take months to recover the tilt-rotor aircraft MV-22 Osprey, after it crashed about 4pm on Saturday during a military exercise.
The Osprey had launched from the USS Bonhomme Richard amphibious assault ship when the "mishap" occurred.
The aircraft, carrying 26 people, reportedly hit the deck of the USS Green Bay and slid into the water.
On Sunday, family members of the three missing marines received the news that the search for survivors had been called off, replaced with a recovery operation.
"Prayers forfamily (sic) and friends of Nathan Ordway he was one of the ones on the v22 crash in Australia," Jon Dakota posted to Facebook.
"I left mct with him. This is crazy."
A 36-year-old man, one of the 23 marines who survived the crash, was flown from Rockhampton Hospital to Brisbane for further treatment to a broken leg.
Australia has sent the navy survey ship HMAS Melville to the area, along with a navy clearance diving team.
Defence Minister Marise Payne said the Australian government was supporting the US forces.
"These recovery operations are complex in nature and are affected by a range of factors including weather conditions, water depth, debris and water current," she said, in a statement.
It is the 10th known crash involving an Osprey - a tilt-rotor aircraft that takes off and lands like a helicopter but flies like an aeroplane - since 1991.
US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were briefed on the incident, while Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk also offered her government's support.
