  <title>Wild winds, rain to lash weekend</title>
  <content>
EXTREME weather has been forecast for parts of Victoria this weekend.
But the Bureau of Meteorology says it will be different from last Saturday's windy conditions.

A revised forecast for this weekend will be realised this morning by BoM and State Emergency Service.
Strong winds have been forecast, with a severe weather warning expected to be issued for parts of the state.
Gusts of up to 130km/h swept through Victoria last Saturday, prompting severe weather warnings to be issued.
The SES received more than 800 calls for help, with 300 due to building damage.
The BoM will release more information at 11am, after conducting a final forecast of this weekend's conditions.
Melbourne can expect a rainy top of 14 degrees tomorrow, with a low of seven overnight.
Similar conditions have been forecast for Sunday with a low of seven and top of 14.

These dedicated weather reporters take 'rain, hail or shine' very seriously.
