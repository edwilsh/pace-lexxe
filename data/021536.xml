CROSSFIT: Olympic weightlifter Tia-Clair Toomey can lay claim to being the fittest woman on Earth after snaring a breakthrough victory at the CrossFit Games.
After finishing runner-up in the past two editions, the Maroochy River product won this year's gruelling four-day competition with a gutsy performance in Madison, Wisconsin.
She finished on 994 points, just two points ahead of compatriot Kara Webb, after taking part in a series of strength and endurance events.
The 23-year-old lifted for Australia at the Rio Games last year but she said winning in the United States was something else.
"Ten times better. Like 100 times better," she said via the The CrossFit Games official website.
She won the run swim run and the muscle-up clean ladder and claimed a string of other consistent places amid 13 events.
Toomey, who is now based in Gladstone but still calls the Sunshine Coast home, owns a gym and only started weightlifting in earnest less than three years ago.
