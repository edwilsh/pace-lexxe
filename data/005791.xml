  <title>Union bans workers from Sydney Opera House renovation after asbestos found</title>
  <content>
The Electrical Trades Union has issued a work ban on the $200 million renovation of the Sydney Opera House, after asbestos was found in the structure last week.

The union was notified several days later, after the substance tested positive.
Mr Page said the electricians, employed by contracting company Downer, were not issued the proper masks and overalls required to enter an area that had asbestos, and most did not have training on how to work safely with the toxic substance.Photo: AAP
On Monday afternoon, the ETU issued a ban encompassing any work on risers (which carry cables vertically between floors), rectangular ceiling lights known as troffers, and other "penetrations that carry electrical services between floors and through walls".
Mr Page said the union's hand was forced after builders Laing O'Rourke and the contractor Downer failed to halt work.

"That's what's blown us away," he said. "When asbestos was identified they didn't cease work. When the testing came back, they still didn't cease work, and we had to intervene.

Mr Page said the electricians had been working in walls, ceilings and between floors as they installed cables and lighting. This might have disturbed some of the asbestos fibres, causing them to become airborne. 
"Once it becomes airborne and there's work going, it's highly possible others have been exposed to this asbestos," Mr Page said.
"They should be in full overalls, and with the proper respiratory gear they need to do the job. Any employee who is working in these areas needs to be fully trained in asbestos awareness."
About 90 per cent of the 25 electricians concerned had not received this training, he said. SafeWork NSW is investigating the asbestos discovery.
In a statement on Monday evening, Laing O'Rourke said work was continuing on the site as normal after the asbestos was safely removed, and some workers were having health checks.
"As with any Sydney building constructed in the 1960s and 1970s, our Sydney Opera House renewal works have planned for the management of asbestos in known and unknown locations, and there is a comprehensive Asbestos Management Plan in place," a spokesperson said.
"The existence of asbestos in original structures of the Opera House was always planned for as part of these major works, and we are taking every precaution and safeguard.
"Asbestos awareness training has also been provided to our employees and subcontractors on the project since the start of works.
"Last week suspect material was identified on site by electricians. The area was isolated and the material was removed safely and in accordance with the Asbestos Management Plan by licensed removalists. Workers have undergone health checks and SafeWork NSW has been notified."
A spokesman for Downer declined to comment.
Electricians would stay away from where the asbestos was found until a fresh risk assessment was done, the union said. They asked Laing O'Rourke to "outline the controls they plan to put in place" and train all electricians in how to deal with asbestos.
Mr Page said the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) had become involved since the work ban was issued, and there was the possibility further bans on the site could be made.
The $200 million renovation of the Opera House is the biggest upgrade since it was opened in 1973. The NSW government funded the renovation with money from the sale of the state's electricity assets.
