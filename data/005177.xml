  <title>Hopefuls line up for mayoral race</title>
  <content>
The field of candidates for the Ipswich City Council mayoral by-election has been finalised with eleven people vying for the position.
Candidate nominations closed at midday today and the draw for ballot paper order was conducted soon after.
Queensland Electoral Commissioner Walter van der Merwe said eleven was a "significant number" of candidates for a council by-election.
"The ballot papers will now be printed so the more than 120,000 Ipswich voters can have their say and elect a new mayor," Mr van der Merwe said.
Here is how candidates will appear on the ballot paper:
1. Jack Paff
2. Paul Rix
3. Peter Robinson
4. Gary Duffy
5. Brett Morrissey
6. Paul Tully
7. Andrew Antoniolli
8. Patricia Petersen
9. Ken Salter
10. Peter Luxton
11. Dallas Klass
The by-election will be held on August 19, but the Electoral Commission of Queensland (ECQ) will start taking votes from next Monday.
"People don't need a special reason to vote early - anyone can go to a pre-poll centre and cast their ballot before election day," Mr van der Merwe said.
"We'll have four pre-poll centres operating from Monday, August 7 - three in the Ipswich area and one at ECQ headquarters in Brisbane."
"Voting is compulsory and ECQ is doing what it can to ensure people are able to make their voices heard."
On election day, ECQ will operate more than 40 polling booths in the Ipswich area from 8am-6pm.
"We are mailing out a Voter Information card which lists the addresses of all 44 polling booths," Mr van der Merwe said.
"It also features a barcode so that polling officials can quickly scan voters' names, mark them off the electronic roll and keep queues moving."
"I encourage everyone to bring the Voter Information card with them, whether they're voting early or on polling day."
