Brazilian police say a British family who made a wrong turn while holidaying outside Rio de Janeiro have been shot at and that a woman was wounded.
Local police say a couple and their three children were driving in Angra dos Reis, a popular coastal holiday spot about 150 kilometres from the city, on Sunday when a group approached the car and apparently told the family to get out before opening fire.
A police statement says the woman was shot in the abdomen and is being treated in hospital. Her condition is not known.
Tourists in Brazil have occasionally been attacked when they accidentally stray into slums, which are often controlled by criminal gangs.
