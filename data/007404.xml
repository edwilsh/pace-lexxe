  <title>More funding for SA schools after NAPLAN</title>
  <content>
South Australian schools will receive a $67.5 million funding increase following poor NAPLAN results.
The extra funding will be used to employ more teachers to help improve literacy and numeracy, SA Education Minister Susan Close said in a statement on Wednesday.
The minister also noted that the NAPLAN results will be analysed and used to direct extra funding to primary schools.
"Getting literacy and numeracy right in the early years is the foundation for students to go on to succeed in the rest of their education," Ms Close said.
SA ranked below the national average in the reading and writing component of the nationwide test.
