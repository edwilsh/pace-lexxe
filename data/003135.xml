  <title>Dog owner loves park life in tropics</title>
  <content>
A MOVE from the harsh Top End climate to work in the Far North's sugar industry proved a sweet shift for Peter Barry.
The Edge Hill resident has found comfort in the tropical, leafy Cairns suburb and loves getting out to the local dog parks.
He listed Goomboora Park at Brinsmead as his favourite.
"There is lots of open space and plenty of social people and dogs," he said.
Holloways Beach and Yorkeys Knob also rank highly as weekend locations.
The former South Australian moved to Cairns after a stint in Darwin.
"I sort of tossed a coin and came east instead of west," he said. "Queensland is all I know now."
The Bureau of Meteorology has forecast possible showers for the next few days, but only 4mm is expected to drizzle.
Temperatures will hover around the 27C mark. Mr Barry is loving the weather, which he said was a comfortable change from Darwin.
"It is a lot more benign," he said. "In Darwin you don't get any rain in the dry season.
"But here you still get a bit of rain and the wet season is more bearable."

It comes as the bureau predicts Cape York, Cairns and the Tablelands are a chance of an early wet season onset.
