  <title>Police seize 10 kilograms of ice near Deniliquin</title>
  <content>
About $5 million of ice has been seized and a man arrested near Deniliquin.
The 42-year-old driver was pulled over on the Sturt Highway early Sunday morning.

The man's white campervan was searched and he taken into custody soon afterward. 

During the search, police located approximately 10 kilograms of white crystallised powder, believed to be ice.
The powder and the vehicle were confiscated for forensic analysis.

If the results are positive for methylamphetamine, the street value of the alleged drug could be worth millions. 

The driver was taken to Hay police station and later released, pending further inquiries.
