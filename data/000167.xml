  <title>Katter party moves to heartland</title>
  <content>
KATTER'S Australian Party is relocating its head office from Brisbane to its heartland in North Queensland.
It will open its head office in Townsville in the next couple of weeks.
KAP leader Bob Katter MP said KAP was relocating its head office to be closer to its supporters.
"KAP was born in North Queensland and it makes sense that head office is in our heartland," Mr Katter said.
"The party is in the final stages of choosing an exact location for its new head office in Townsville."
KAP has three elected Members of Parliament including Shane Knuth and Robbie Katter.
"KAP offers people an alternative to the major parties that isn't just a 'no' vote," Mr Katter said.
"The party establishes constructive policy in consultation with the electorates it represents.
"In Queensland State Parliament, only 14 Private Members' Bills have ever become law; two of them were KAP bills. "
