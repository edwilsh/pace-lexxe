  <title>Search finds no trace of slain Qld teen</title>
  <content>
An extensive search of bush west of Brisbane has uncovered no trace of slain teenager Tiffany Taylor who has been missing for two years.
Acting on a tip off, a search party of around 40 emergency rescue and police officers scoured dense bushland and difficult terrain near Banks Creek Road in Fernvale on Saturday but no evidence of the 16-year-old was found.
Rodney Wayne Williams, 60, was charged with Tiffany's murder, but her body has never been found.
Tiffany has not been seen since allegedly meeting up with the 60-year-old on July 12, 2015.
The Logan teenager was pregnant with her 41-year-old partner's child and was using online dating sites to sell sexual services.
Earlier this month police appealed to the public saying just one phone call with information could be all it took to find Tiffany's body and give her family some answers.
Investigators were particularly looking for information on a 1995 champagne-coloured Hyundai Excel and had yet to track down Tiffany's white Samsung S5 mobile phone.
Police are still appealing for information.
