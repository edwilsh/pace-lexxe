No one was injured when a gunshot was fired into a home on the New South Wales south coast.
Two men allegedly knocked on the front door of the Warilla home at about 12:30am on Tuesday and started an argument with the male resident.
The two men then fired a shot into the front window of the house, before fleeing in a white sedan.
