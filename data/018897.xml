  <title>Court told men's dad acted as look-out during burglaries</title>
  <content>
The father of two men allegedly responsible for a string of break-ins at regional drinking spots is claimed to have acted as the look-out while his nephew and sons raided the premises, Wollongong Local Court heard yesterday.Anthony Edward Welland, 55, is accused of parking outside five targeted clubs and watching for police as his nephew and two sons stole or damaged an estimated $250,000 worth of property, facts before the court said.The Warrawong father yesterday pleaded not guilty to five counts of aggravated breaking and entering and one charge of participating in a criminal group.Welland's sons Shane, 32, (also known as Nathan Thompson) and Steven, 22, and his nephew Trevor Hanson were charged earlier this month with carrying out eight break-and-enters at clubs and hotels over a one-year period.Police claim Welland parked his car at a "forward observation position" so he could report potential police sightings to the trio while they allegedly broke into the Bulli Bowling Club and Scarborough Wombarra Bowling Club in the early hours of February 17 this year.According to the facts, Welland performed the same task when the men hit the Albion Park Hotel on February 28 and two Shoalhaven hotels in March.On several occasions, it is alleged Welland also picked the trio up after they had dumped stolen vehicles used in the break-ins.Police allege phone records show calls between the men and a phone registered to Welland's partner around the time of the alleged offences.In opposing bail yesterday, prosecutor Sgt Aaron Wunderlich said the offences were serious and involved a high degree of planning.Defence lawyer Jane Healey said the prosecution had a weak, circumstantial case.Ms Healey told the court Welland had recently had significant wrist and hip surgery, had other health problems and was willing to report to police or comply with a curfew.Magistrate Michael Stoddart refused bail and adjourned the matter until July 27.
