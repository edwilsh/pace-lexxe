  <title>Manus Island death sparks concerns for refugees</title>
  <content>
The death of a refugee on Manus Island has sparked serious concerns others will be injured or killed if Australian authorities don't intervene.
The man reportedly took his own life before he was due to move from detention into the Papua New Guinean community, with advocacy group Doctors for Refugees describing his death as a preventable tragedy.
"More deaths are likely unless the Australian government acts immediately to bring these people, on both Manus Island and Nauru, to safety in Australia," Dr David Berger said on Monday.
The Turnbull government has consistently said refugees being held on Manus Island and Nauru will never settle in Australia.
Tensions are high on Manus Island, with water and electricity cut off to some compounds at the regional processing centre as authorities try to shuffle detainees around ahead of its October closure.

The dead man is understood to be an Iranian refugee with a history of mental illness.
"He was very sick for (a) long time but Australia did not provide medical treatment for him," Iranian journalist and Manus Island refugee Behrouz Boochani, posted to Twitter.
