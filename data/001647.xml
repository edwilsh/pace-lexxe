Dr. Clive Harrison, deputy director of academic affairs at the Australian Institute of Music (AIM), says many HSC graduates want more than "dry science" and an educational shift is needed in response to student thinking. 
"Students want to build a future that includes imagination, creativity, and societal conscience," Harrison says. "We should redress the imbalanced focus on traditional STEM courses by delivering STEAM." The 'A' is for arts.Photo: Supplied
If you're not sure what paths creative study can take and want to know more, get a long to an open day in August-September. 
AIM has classical and contemporary music, composition, music production, audio, music theatre, entertainment arts management and dramatic arts courses. Open day at AIM's Sydney campus includes music workshops and masterclasses, performances and a Q&A with industry experts and alumni.  

Saturday August 12, 10am-3pm, Surry Hills.
