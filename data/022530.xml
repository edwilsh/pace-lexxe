  <content>
A missing Victorian woman whose backpack was discovered on a Gold Coast beach has been found.
Police confirmed on Monday afternoon that 40-year-old Gail Elizabeth Oliver has been located safe and well.
It followed an earlier appeal for information after a member of the public found her backpack on Kurrawa Beach at Broadbeach about 6.15am.
A search of the beach and water had failed to locate the 40-year-old, who was reported missing in her home state.
