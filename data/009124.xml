  <title>Who will follow Mitchell, Priddis?</title>
  <content>
WEST Coast veteran Sam Mitchell today announced 2017 would be his last playing season.
He became the second Eagle in as many weeks to hang up the boots, with fellow Brownlow medallist Matt Priddis calling time on his AFL career on Friday.
So who will be the next to go?
In this week's edition of the Duff and Quarters AFL podcast, The West Australian chief football writer Mark Duffield believes it could be big man Drew Petrie.
How much is Mitch McGovern worth?

Petrie has been serviceable since arriving at the Eagles in last year's rookie draft, playing 10 games and providing cover for injured ruckmen Nic Naitanui (knee) and Scott Lycett (shoulder).
But, with Naitanui and Lycett set to return in 2018 and fellow tall Nathan Vardy performing strongly this year, Duffield advised the former Roo not to go around again.
"He's been OK (this season), but he shouldn't harbour no ambitions to go on in 2018," Duffield said.

"I've heard that there's just a chance he's thinking about it, but I would advise strongly against it with Nic Naitanui and Scott Lycett back next year.
"You can always find a third ruckman, they have Fraser McInnes who they can keep on the list cheap as a young guy who they can get some footy out of if they get to the stage of needing a fourth ruckman.
"But I don't think the answer is to go back to Drew Petrie next year."
Duffield and his partner in crime, The Sunday Times sports editor Glen Quartermain, also discuss Patrick Dangerfield's suspension and what the future will hold for out-of-contract Crows forward Mitch McGovern.
Do the Brownlow rules need to be changed?
