  <title>Brisbane bus strike: Major impacts to services expected as drivers plan fourth strike</title>
  <content>
Brisbane bus drivers will continue rolling strikes on Wednesday, with plans to walk off the job for four hours.
The Rail, Tram and Bus Union said its members would stop work from 10:00am to 2:00pm, as part of an ongoing industrial campaign over pay, conditions, rostering and safety.
It will be the fourth day of action for union members, which included driver strikes during Friday's peak hour, affecting up to 100,000 commuters
Bus drivers also walked off the job  and also refused to collect fares on Thursday.
Brisbane Lord Mayor Graham Quirk said Brisbane City Council's budget made allowances for a 2.5 per cent wage increase for bus drivers.
He said any further increase would have an impact on rates in future years.
"The additional wage level the unions are seeking would cost ratepayers about $52 million over three years," Councillor Quirk said.
"Council will continue discussions with the unions to ensure an acceptable outcome for workers and the ratepayers of this city.
"Council staff provide a tremendous service to the people of Brisbane and we have made a fair and reasonable wage offer in line with community expectations for the next three years."
Major impacts to bus services across the network are expected until approximately 2:45pm as services start returning to normal.
Commuters who normally travel during these times are advised to plan ahead and make alternative arrangements.
The union has been contacted for comment.
