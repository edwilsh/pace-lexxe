  <title>Jerry Seinfeld review: Comedian barely wastes a word with slick stand-up </title>

COMEDY
JERRY SEINFELD ★★★★ 1/2
Hisense Arena, August 6, 7 and 8
Reviewed by Martin Boulton
The sneakers and jeans Jerry Seinfeld wore in 180 episodes of Seinfeld from the late '80s to 1998 were nowhere to be seen on the first of his three nights in Melbourne. Dressed immaculately in a suit and tie, he looks more like he's stepping into a business meeting than the business of comedy.Photo: Kevin Mazur
One thing, however, this 63-year-old New Yorker pulls off as smoothly as his comedy is looking relaxed. No matter there's thousands of people in the room to see and hear him; it could just as easily be a one-on-one conversation as he points out the many negatives about "going out" for the night.  
It's been nearly two decades since his last Australian shows, but the enduring appeal of his observational comedy style lies somewhere between this everyman and the up-close, often awkward and mostly personal insights that made Seinfeld the most successful sitcom on television. On stage, these insights come thick and fast, polished and barely a word wasted in 90 minutes.
Our growing addiction to 21st century technology would have been manna from heaven for Seinfeld's scriptwriters, so too the proliferation of energy drinks that promise to revitalise ordinary people when, as Seinfeld suggests, a nap would probably do the job. Both subjects tap into our modern lives, as does the majority of this performance, poking fun at what motivates us on one hand and drives us to distraction on the other.
A few local references to things he's noticed in Australia were appreciated by the crowd, but in keeping with the tone of the TV show that made him a household name, Seinfeld avoids anything to do with politics, sticking tightly to his razor sharp dissection of everyday events.

Swearing, used by many stand-up comedians for added impact, is not a technique used by Seinfeld. He doesn't utter one swear word and takes just two sips from his glass of water throughout the whole time he's on stage.
"You know me, you know everything about my life," he said at the outset, but the latter part of the show focuses on just that, Seinfeld's life at home. Life with his wife, his three children, the ups and downs and the many Seinfeld moments that must fill his notebooks.

Of course, his life would be a whole lot simpler with more time to watch baseball on TV,  but it probably wouldn't be as funny.
