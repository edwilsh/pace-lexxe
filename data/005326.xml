  <title>Honda reports 19 per cent rise in profit</title>
  <content>
Japanese car maker Honda is reporting a nearly 19 per cent improvement in its fiscal first quarter profit on better sales and cost cuts.
The Tokyo-based manufacturer, which makes the Fit subcompact, Accord sedan and Asimo robot, reported a 207.3 billion yen ($A2.4 billion) profit on Tuesday for April-June, up from 174.6 billion yen the same period last year.
Quarterly sales rose 7 per cent to 3.71 trillion yen.
Honda expects to sell 5.08 million vehicles for the fiscal year through March 2018, up from nearly 5.03 million vehicles for the last fiscal year.
Honda raised its annual profit forecast to 545 billion yen from an earlier forecast it gave in April for 530 billion yen. Its profit was 616.5 billion yen in the previous year.
