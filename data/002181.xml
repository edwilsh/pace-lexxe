  <title>Heat set for Star studded Big Bash opener</title>
  <content>
IT took Brisbane Heat officials less than an hour to realise last season's barnstorming momentum is set to spill into next summer.
The Heat opened membership renewals on Monday and within an hour of sending an email had several dozen confirmations.
For the first time the Heat will cap memberships at 3500, meaning the early demand is likely to continue.
The Heat are coming off a record summer of five sold-out games, including a semi-final, last season that attracted 171,877 fans.
This year there will be an expanded schedule (40 games after 32 last season) which will feature five home games apart from the finals and push the schedule a week beyond the school holidays.
"We're very pleased with the allocation of our home games for the fans, with one pre-Christmas game not long after school holidays start, one between Christmas and New Year's Day, and then three through January including a double header with the WBBL Heat," Heat general manager Andrew McShea said.
"We're very pleased with the allocation of our home games for the fans, with one pre-Christmas game not long after school holidays start, one between Christmas and New Year's Day, and then three through January including a double header with the WBBL Heat," McShea said.
"The opening home game against the Melbourne Stars on December 20 will be a bumper match. Based on last season we are aiming for sellouts each match so we will be urging fans to pre-purchase tickets once they go on sale,'' he said.
Channel 10 will broadcast the matches in the final year of their five-year contract with Cricket Australia.
CA is set to soon start negotiations for the next rights deal with Channel 9 likely to have a massive tilt at the Big Bash rights which went for $20 million a year last time but are likely to rise to $50 million.
