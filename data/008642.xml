  <title>Sam Mitchell's move into coaching the next step after glorious Hawthorn and West Coast AFL career</title>

Sam Mitchell has had one of the great all-time AFL careers - but the way it started was less than ideal.
As a young man playing his footy for Mooroolbark in Victoria he failed to get selected in the 2000 AFL draft. Things changed, however, when he joined Hawthorn's VFL affiliate, Box Hill.
A solid season in the VFL led to Mitchell being taken at pick 36 in the 2001 draft, a 2002 debut for the Hawks and a 16-year-career in the AFL.
The rest is now Hawthorn and AFL history.
So when Mitchell spoke out in trade week last year, expressing an interest to leave his home at Hawthorn and head to the West Coast Eagles, the news came as a genuine shock.
Mitchell was seen as part of the furniture at Hawthorn - a five-time Hawks' best-and-fairest, a four-time premiership player, and one of the most highly rated midfielders in the AFL - and a move initially seemed the stuff of fanciful off-season rumour.
What made the news more stunning was that Mitchell revealed coach Alastair Clarkson had planted the seed in a private conversation a couple of weeks previously.

Mitchell's mighty career

2008, 2013, 2014, 2015 premierships with Hawthorn
Premiership captain 2008
Brownlow Medallist 2012
Four-time Hawthorn best-and-fairest
Three-time All Australian
AFL Rising Star 2003

He would be followed out the door by long-time teammate Jordan Lewis, who headed to Melbourne as the Hawks tried to free up some cap space to grab free agent targets Jaeger O'Meara and Tom Mitchell.
The lure of the move west was an opportunity for Mitchell to get into coaching after his playing career wound down, a move that will begin in 2018 with the Eagles.
West Coast might have hoped that Mitchell might be the last piece of the puzzle to have a shot at the flag.
After round one, it looked like a genius move, as Mitchell was best on ground, gathering 38 disposals in a big win over North Melbourne.
The hope has not come to fruition, in a disappointing season for the Eagles that still might yet end in a finals appearance.

But the new recruit cannot be blamed. He came across on a four-year contract, and will stay on as an assistant coach for the next three seasons.
Mitchell has played 16 out of the 19 games the Eagles have played so far in 2017, as coach Adam Simpson and West Coast managed the 34-year-old.
He has averaged 27 disposals (10 contested), three tackles, 4.5 clearances, three inside 50s and two rebound 50s a game.
Not a bad return - and that's not counting his footy smarts around the ground, his ability to set up plays and the 16 years of AFL experience he can pass on as a mentor to younger players.
Late in his career he was awarded a Brownlow Medal along with Richmond's Trent Cotchin - but not in the circumstances he would have wanted, following the ruling by the AFL Commission over Jobe Watson's 2012 medal win.
It's not that he did not deserve a Brownlow, far from it.

A look at the tables shows Mitchell has the joint second most career Brownlow votes - along with Gary Ablett Jr - of 220, including 44 maximum three-vote games over 15 seasons prior to this year.
Early on in his career, Mitchell was classed as "the Extractor" for his ability to hoover up clearances at will. In an AFL career that has spanned 322 league matches, he has averaged 5.49 clearances a game.
But it was never just the number, it was the timing.
Whenever the Hawks seemed in trouble, or the game was in the balance, Mitchell would pop up at the right time and set up a telling attack for the brown and gold.
Some might say that he never had the pace or overall skills of some other star midfielders. But his combination of hard work, and timing, and a footy brain that's arguably been unmatched in this era, ensured his career will stand alongside the best to have played the game.
