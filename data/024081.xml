  <title>Dancers add to Scottish tale</title>
  <content>
FANCY a fling? Logan's popular McCullough Highland Dancers will show people on the northside a reel or two when they perform in Sandgate Theatre's August production of Brigadoon.
The  young dancers and their coach Barbara McCullough, who are all from Logan and Springfield, give the musical production a true Scottish flavour.
Heather Clarke's country dancing gives the show a point of difference to other productions of the popular musical, made famous by the 1954 movie starring Gene Kelly and Van Johnson.
Kilts, bagpipes, Highland flings, music and costumes all add to the fun of the musical, which tells the story of two American tourists who stumble upon Brigadoon, the mysterious Scottish village which appears for only one day every 100 years.
Tommy, one of the tourists, falls in love with Fiona, a young woman from Brigadoon.
Talented director Lilian Harrington keeps the show moving at a fast clip with colourful and realistic backdrops and sets.
The Sandgate Theatre company welcomed the support from the wider community, and the dancers were more than willing to put their talents on show and make the trek northside to show off their spirited highland dancing.
Brigadoon runs from August 11 to 20, Fridays and Saturdays at 7.30pm with a Sunday matinee at 2pm on August 20.
