  <title>Accused killer asked jail mate if he could get a witness 'knocked', court told</title>
  <content>
A man has told a court that accused murderer Christopher Lavery asked him in jail if he could get a witness "knocked".
Mr Lavery, 31, is standing trial for the March 2008 murder of James Russouw, whose body was found stabbed to death and on fire in his Jeep beside a suburban sports oval.
The man, who can only be described as "Witness B" told the Supreme Court of Victoria on Thursday that he "changed the subject right away" when Mr Lavery asked him if he knew anyone who could kill the witness.
He said he didn't do anything beyond disengaging with Mr Lavery because he was "probably scared".
Mr Lavery's defence counsel Scott Johns suggested the conversation never happened, and that Mr Lavery, intimidated as a newcomer to the custody system, wouldn't have made such comments.
Mr Johns also suggested if the conversations had happened, Witness B would have removed himself from Mr Lavery.

"I was in the same jail, the same area, it was very small," Witness B told the court.
Mr Lavery has long had an alibi - that he was at a movie at Forest Hill Chase at the time of Mr Russouw's murder.

But the man he went to the cinema with, who in turn can only be described as "Witness A", told police in March last year that Mr Lavery had, in fact,  left the film partway through.
In early March last year, Victoria Police advertised a $1 million reward for information leading to a conviction.
The hearing continues.
