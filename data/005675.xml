  <title>Saints veteran in doubt after VFL setback</title>

David Armitage hasn't played in the AFL since round four

TOUGH St Kilda onballer David Armitage could miss his second straight week after experiencing groin soreness in his comeback from two operations.                        

The left-footer last played AFL in round four against Collingwood before he was sent in for adductor release surgery. 

He went under the knife again the following month to fix the problem. 

Armitage, 29, came back through the VFL two weekends ago and played 60 minutes of game time before sitting out the last quarter, instead doing extra running. 

The plan had been for the midfielder to play around 80 minutes last weekend but he wasn't considered fit. 

He faces a test at training on Thursday before a decision is made on whether he lines up for Sandringham against Casey at Trevor Barker Oval on Saturday afternoon. 

St Kilda sits in 11th spot with a 9-9 record as it bids to make finals for the first time since 2011.
