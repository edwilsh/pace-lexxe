  <title>Chinese held for Nazi salutes in Berlin</title>
  <content>
Two Chinese tourists have been detained for performing banned Nazi salutes in front of the German parliament in Berlin, police say.
Officers saw the two men, aged 36 and 49, taking photos of each other making the gesture in front of the Reichstag on Saturday.
Police said in a statement that the men were questioned at a nearby precinct but later released after leaving a security deposit of 500 euros ($A747) each.
They face a criminal investigation for using symbols associated with organisations that are considered to be in breach of Germany's constitution. Convictions can incur a fine or a prison sentence of up to three years.
