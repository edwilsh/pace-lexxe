  <title>Scaramucci says expletive-laden interview was 'off the record"</title>
  <content>
Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci says he was "joking" off the record when he made an expletive-laden rant about his colleagues that resulting in him losing his job.
The former hedge fund manager, nicknamed "the Mooch", told The Huffington Posthis comments - published in the New Yorker by journalist Ryan Lizza - were not meant for publication.
"Most of what I said was humorous and joking," Mr Scaramucci said.
Mr Scaramucci labelled then-chief of staff Reince Priebus "a f***ing paranoid schizophrenic" and said chief strategist Steve Bannon was "trying to suck his own c**k".
Mr Priebus was fired a day later.
"Legally, it may have been on the record, but the spirit of it was off. And [Lizza] knew that."
The former financier said the pair's families "have been friends for over 50 years" as their fathers knew each other from construction, and "we were building a personal relationship".
Ms Lizza said they "are not and have never been old family friends", despite their fathers' relationship.

"But that would not be a reason to suppress an explosive on-the-record interview," she said.
After Ms Scaramucci's resignation, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said President Donald Trump thought the remarks were "inappropriate".
Mr Scaramucci said he offered to resign in the immediate aftermath of the interview, but was told it was not necessary.
A few days later, new White House chief of staff John Kelly called Mr Scaramucci into his office and asked for his resignation in "a very polite conversation".
After his 10 controversy-filled days in the White House, Mr Scaramucci said he is "now going to go dark".
"Then I will re-emerge ... as me," he said.
