  <content>
Fires which caused minor damage to two Gold Coast schools are being investigated as arson.
On Wednesday evening a small fire was lit in a classroom of a Mermaid Waters school and on Friday night attempts were made to torch another classroom at a Clear Island Waters school.
"Initial investigations indicate that in both fires, flammable material was pushed under the classroom doors and set alight," police said.
