  <title>Labor protects Gold Coast Spit, rejects casino</title>
  <content>
A multibillion-dollar integrated resort and casino in southeast Queensland has been rejected by the State Government, saying the area where it was proposed must be protected.

Chinese-backed company ASF had planned a five-tower integrated resort, including a casino, on Crown land on the Spit at Southport, on the Gold Coast.

ASF had been named as the preferred proponent for the resort and a second Coast casino.

Announcing the shock decision, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk today said The Spit needed to be protected.

"This part of the GC is unique to qlders and unique to the world," she said.

She said Cabinet made the "very important decision" yesterday.

"The first decision we made was to terminate the ASF proposal for the spit."

Ms Palaszczuk said another decision made by Cabinet was to have a masterplan for The Spit.

"I used to come here as a young girl, I still come here," she said.

"This area is probably equivalent to what Central Park is to New York."

Ms Palaszczuk said a three-storey height limit for development would apply on The Spit.

She said the casino licence would remain on the Gold Coast but no integrated resort would be allowed on The Spit.

She said the traffic congestion from the ASF proposal would result in locals paying more in rates and an "eyesore" in terms of new road development.

The project would have been a major job creator but was unpopular with many locals. Opposers, led by former Beattie government minister Judy Spence, had railed against the ASF proposal.

Mayor Tom Tate's plans for a cruise ship terminal on the Spit are not expected to be impacted by the Government's decision.

It comes a month after ASF Consortium director  he was in talks with Caesars Entertainment regarding the proposal. The global giant is behind famed Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.

"ASF Consortium has been in ongoing discussions with a number of world-class operators," he said in July.
