  <title>Defeated PNG opp'n leader says violence in Enga not his fault</title>
  <content>
Unrest in Papua New Guinea's Enga Province is being blamed on what the losing candidate in the Kandep electorate is describing as vote rigging.
Supporters of the former opposition leader Don Polye rioted when it was announced he had lost his seat to the PNC candidate, Alfred Manase.
Police and military reinforcements were sent into the area amid reports of injuries and houses being burned.
The defeated candidate, Don Polye, is appealing for calm, but he says the violence is not his fault.
