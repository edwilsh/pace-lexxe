  <title>Iron ore's 'Goldilocks moment' means big profit without new supply </title>
  <content>
The world's biggest producer of iron ore says the industry is enjoying a "Goldilocks moment", with prices generating a tidy profit but not enough to lure much new supply.
"The market is in a sweet spot right now from $US60 to $US70," Vale chief financial officer Luciano Siani Pires told Bloomberg Television on Thursday.Photo: Louie Douvis
"It is a price which does not incentivise too much swing capacity to come back and it's a very profitable range for major mining companies."
Prices of the steel-making ingredient have see-sawed this year, rallying to $US95 in February before tumbling to $US53 in mid-June as glut fears resurfaced.

Now they're back above $US70 after an up-tick in demand from Chinese steel mills.
But prices probably will average $US50 in the final three months as falling steel prices hurt mills' margins, according to Barclays. India's JSW Steel said this week that prices might go as low as $US40.

Vale disagrees.
It's betting prices will stay in a $US60 to $US70 range for the rest of the year, supported by still "very strong" demand and supply "that is a little more tame," Siani Pires said from Bloomberg's Rio de Janeiro office.
More normal

For Vale - even more so than its main rivals, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton - the differences in price outlook are a big deal.
Each $US1 drop in iron ore had a $US350 million impact on the Brazilian company, the CFO said. That in turn affects its ability to bring down a whopping $US22 billion debt load and return cash to shareholders.
While China's demand outlook remained bright, underpinned by infrastructure spending, growth was set to return to "more normalised" levels from the current rate of about 5 to 6 per cent, he said.
"We're positive about China and we never shared the views that the country would collapse," Siani Pires said.
