  <title>Kathmandu expects net profit to rise at least 11.6 pc</title>

It's not all doom and gloom in retail, judging by a positive trading update from Kathmandu, which now expects net profit to rise at least 11.6 per cent in 2017.
Kathmandu chief executive Xavier Simonet said on Thursday the outdoor clothing retailer expected earnings before interest and tax for the 12 months ending July to come in between $NZ56 million and $NZ57 million, compared with $NZ50.9 million last year, exceeding consensus forecasts around $NZ54.3 million.
Kathmandu expects to achieve a net profit between $NZ37.4 million and $NZ38.0 million, compared with $NZ33.5 million in 2016, beating consensus forecasts around $NZ36.6 million.
Sales are expected to rise 4.6 per cent to $NZ445.3 million, ahead of market forecasts of $NZ442 million, underpinned by a 5.5 per cent rise in same-store sales.

Mr Simonet attributed the better than expected trading to successive winter promotions, new products and better engagement with customers.

"Our financial performance has been strengthened further during 2017 through operating leverage, reduced inventory and record low debt," he said.
Kathmandu will release full year results on September 26.
