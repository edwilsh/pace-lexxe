  <title>Inaccurate Saints: Who's the worst offender?</title>
  <content>
Josh Bruce has booted 29.20 this year

INACCURATE goalkicking could be St Kilda's downfall in its bid to make finals, with the Saints costing themselves almost 10 points per game with their misses.

Furthermore, the shots they have taken are relatively easy with their expected conversion of 50.6 per cent second in the AFL, behind only Melbourne (52.3 per cent).

However, they nail 5.5 per cent fewer shots than they should - ranked second-last in that category (with Richmond 18th).

The stats, compiled by Champion Data, compared how Saints players have kicked against the competition average and take into account where shots at goal are taken from, what type of kicks they were and the pressure the players were under. 

Josh Bruce just missed the unmissable ðŸ˜±

Misses were particularly costly early in road trips to face West Coast in round two and Port Adelaide last weekend, while the side's percentage of 96.7 has taken a hammering from the inaccuracy.

Champion Data has also ranked every club based on its average expected score compared to its actual score.

On that measure, St Kilda is ranked 17th. Again, only Richmond has been more wasteful.

The Saints score 9.4 points per match fewer than they should, compared to the competition average.

The problem plagues about half of any side that has represented St Kilda this season, with Mav Weller, Jack Lonie and Jack Steele the worst offenders.

Other players who have reputations as impressive field kicks, like Jack Billings, Jade Gresham and Josh Bruce, have also let the side down.
