  <title>Monash crash causes long delays</title>
  <content>
OUTBOUND traffic has been brought to a crawl in Melbourne's eastern suburbs after a car collided with railing on the Monash Freeway.
Emergency services were called to the crash, near the Ferntree Gully ramp at Glen Waverley, and closed two outbound lanes while working to clear the scene.
An Ambulance Victoria spokeswoman said a man, believed to be in his 50s, had been assessed by paramedics but was not taken to hospital.
Motorists in the area have been advised to seek alternative routes to avoid long delays as it is not yet known how long the lanes will be closed for.
No one else was injured in the crash.
