  <title>'Queen' Nic hits Coast with kids in tow</title>
  <content>
NICOLE KIDMAN is keeping mum on the Gold Coast.
While the Australian actor had managed to fly under the public radar since jetting into Queensland last Wednesday, she was snapped enjoying a day out with her daughters over the weekend.
After browsing the Mummy Tree Markets at Sanctuary Cove on Saturday, Kidman stopped off for some lunch at a local cafe, leaving her nanny and security detail to mind her daughters Sunday Rose, 9, and Faith Margaret, 6, who were riding motorised toy elephants.
Kidman, who lives in Nashville with husband Keith Urban, swapped her usual glamour for a modest flannelette shirt and jeans while her hair was hidden under a cap.
The 50-year-old spent two days last week filming her role of Queen Atlannis in the movie Aquaman at Village Roadshow Studios and on a constructed set at Coomera.
She is expected to have wrapped her scenes in the DC Comics film.
