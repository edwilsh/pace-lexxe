  <title>Turnbull treats refugees as cattle: Greens</title>
  <content>
Malcolm Turnbull's leaked phone call with Donald Trump is proof the Australian government trades refugees like cattle, Greens immigration spokesman Nick McKim says.
A full transcript of the leaders' colourful January conversation was published on Thursday, with the US president praising his Australian counterpart for being "worse than I am" when it came to refusing refugees.
"The Australian people do not want to see other human beings treated like cattle and traded in the marketplace," Senator McKim said in Hobart.
