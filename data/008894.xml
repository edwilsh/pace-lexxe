  <title>Firefighter and brother charged over blaze</title>
  <content>
A firefighter and his brother have been charged with deliberately lighting bushfires that tore through the NSW Hunter region during summer.
Fire crews battled blazes in the Hunter Valley on January 18 which damaged a number of sheds and outbuildings, and forced a woman and her young daughter to be airlifted from a burning property.
The 28-year-old firefighter Joshua Lambkin was arrested at a home in Weston on Monday, NSW Police said on Wednesday.
He was charged with four counts of intentionally starting a fire as well as concealing the offence of another.
His brother, Craig Talman Lambkin, was arrested on Tuesday and charged with three counts of intentionally causing a fire.
Craig, 27, was already facing charges of lighting a different bushfire just days after the January 18 blaze.
Joshua Lambkin was granted conditional bail and is due to appear at Cessnock Local Court on September 6, while his younger brother was refused bail to appear in Newcastle Local Court on Wednesday.
