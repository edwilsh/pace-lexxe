  <title>Ex-Docker guilty of police chase charges</title>
  <content>
FORMER Fremantle Dockers footballer Shane Yarran has pleaded guilty to a string of offences relating to a police chase, but he denies stabbing a man outside a pub with a broken bottle.
The 27-year-old has been behind bars in Hakea remand prison since May 24 when he allegedly reached 125km/h in a 60km/h zone during an early morning police pursuit in Gosnells, then hid in bushes before being found by police dog Nacho.
He pleaded guilty in the Perth Magistrates Court on Tuesday to nine offences, including reckless driving and disorderly conduct, but pleaded not guilty to unlawful wounding, a charge that was laid after he allegedly attacked a man with a broken bottle outside the Westfield Tavern in Camillo in July 2015.
