  <title>Survivor's selfless act doesn't pay off</title>
  <content>
MARK 'Tarzan' Herlaar gave away the hidden immunity idol that he found in Samoa, and in the end that choice cost him his place in the game.
However Herlaar said he doesn't regret giving the idol to his closet ally in Samoa - Victorian doctor Tessa O'Halloran - but he does regret letting player AK Knight know about it.
"If I have one regret, it was telling bloody AK,' he said.
"In hindsight, which is easy to say, myself and Tess could have kept that to ourselves.
"I guess it's just one of those things."
Herlaar had hoped to get Knight to switch and blindside his alliance on the Samatau tribe, but in the end the most talked about player on Australian Survivor, decided not to switch.
In Herlaar's selfless move in giving O'Halloran the idol saved her - she received give votes, Herlaar received three, and Lockie, one vote.
When O'Halloran played the immunity idol, that Herlaar gave her, he ran out of luck and he was sent packing.
In an unusual move, Herlaar also voted for O'Halloran, but he said he knew he was going home anyway, and he looked at his vote in a different way.
"I did vote for her, but I only vote for her as a vote of confidence," he said.
"I know that she couldn't go home, and I knew I was destined to go home, unless everybody voted for Lockie, and that wasn't going to happen.
"It didn't matter."
Despite getting voted off Australian Survivor before the merge, the Queenland lime farmer described his Australian Survivor experience as "incredible."
He said he didn't mind getting voted out, and was very happy how he handled himself.
"Jonathan said to me at the end, that I looked like I was at peace, and I was," he said.
"I'm always a peace, I let the circumstances determine by identity.
"I had a ball."
He hopes his friend O'Halloran will win Australian Survivor, and he also praised his nemesis, South Australian wedding DJ, Knight.

"When he got rid of Adam (poker player Adam Parkin), I congratulated him on that.
"I said to him, well played, I never saw that coming.
"He really knows the game, he is a master of the game.
"The man is very clever, and I take my hat of to him.
"I love him, but he is forever stabbing people in the back."
Australian Survivor is on air again tonight, on Channel 10 from 7.30pm.
