  <title>Art Series Hotels sell to Mantra for $52m</title>
  <content>
Melbourne's Deague family has sold the management and leasehold rights of its well-known Art Series Hotels to Mantra Group for $52.5 million.

Since then, the group has expanded across Victoria, South Australia and Queensland and now has seven four- to five-star boutique hotels with more than 1000 suites named after notable painters like John Olsen and Charles Blackman.

ASX-listed Mantra Group - which controls the Peppers, Mantra and Breakfree hotel brands - said it funded the acquisition of the leasehold, management rights and Art Series brand with cash and debt facilities.
The deal also includes freehold title to key commercial areas in the hotels, receptions and administration offices.

Mantra Group's existing hotel portfolio covers 128 properties with more than 21,500 rooms under management in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and Hawaii.

The deal would contribute about $7 million to Mantra's underlying earnings before interest and tax in its first full year of ownership, group chief executive Bob East said.
It included a hotel under development in the Deague's latest property venture in Box Hill, expected to open this November, which would be loss-making in its first year of ownership, he said.
The Deagues' $330 million twin-tower project, Whitehorse Towers, includes 511 apartments, shops, commercial space and a luxury 100-room hotel, The Chen, named after Chinese Australian artist Zhong Chen.
