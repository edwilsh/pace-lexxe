A man who sparked a massive search after he went missing in a remote area of WA's Pilbara on Thursday has been found.

The pair became separated late on Thursday afternoon, and the alarm was raised late on Thursday evening after the woman walked into the Georgia Bore Camp disoriented and dehydrated.
Police launched a large scale search for Mr Collis, and eventually located his vehicle 1km north of Well 22.

When it was determined Mr Collis was not with his car, specialist trackers from the elite tactical response group, police airwing, local officers and State Emergency Service Volunteers joined the search.
On Sunday morning, WA Police spokesperson Adam Brouwer confirmed officers had located Mr Collis at around 8am, approximately 1km north of Well 22.Photo: WA Police
"He is dehydrated and suffering from exposure, but otherwise fine," he said.
"He is currently being flown by helicopter to Newman Hospital for treatment."Photo: Supplied
