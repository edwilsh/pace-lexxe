KIIS FM shock jock Kyle Sandilands has revealed he has tipped the scales at 135 kilograms before asking media personality Eddie McGuire for help.
McGuire  after revealing he had shed a whopping 20kg in a matter of weeks following an extreme diet.
The intensive 12-week program is based on Chinese herbs and involves not eating or drinking anything other than three cups of herb tonic a day for the first two weeks.

During an on-air interview on the Kyle and Jackie O Show, Sandilands, 46, told McGuire: "I'm 135 kilos Eddie - help me."
"It does take a bit of mental strength to get through but I found it relatively easy going," McGuire told the hosts, detailing his diet.
"You have the herbs but also you go and get the acupuncture and a massage for the first couple of weeks and also get weighed in everyday so that gets you a bit honest."

"You're probably the same Kyle, you've probably put on a kilo-and-a-half or two kilos every year."
Sandilands is shown holding up five fingers to his co-host Jackie O.
"You reckon I put on five (kilos) a year Jackie?" he was heard asking, which she nods in agreement. "Jesus."

McGuire responded by complimenting Sandilands, describing him as a "strong-minded bloke."
"You get belligerent like I did and when everyone starts pushing food in front of you, offering you drinks or saying you weren't working and then when it's all done they say, 'You're a plonk of fat'," he added.
Sandilands quipped "I'm in" when McGuire said people were allowed to smoke during the diet.
