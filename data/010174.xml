  <title>Supporting cancer sufferers and families</title>
  <content>
THE fields were filled with people coming together to raise money for people in need and enjoy a fun day with like minded people.
Held at CEX Woolgoolga bowling club, the Coffs Coast Freemasons Association organised a day of bowling with people attending from around the state to raise money for the CanDo Cancer Trust.
The event is held annually to raise money to help cancer patients and their families.
With the support of 40 sponsors and 110 bowlers on the day, a cheque of $14,200 was raised and presented to the CanDo Cancer Trust.
"This means we will be able to help 24 local families and relieve some of the financial burden that cancer sufferers can experience through loss of income and additional costs," said PR officer for Coffs Coast Freemasons Association, Carolyn Boyden.
The Coffs Coast Freemasons Association raised $100,000 to start off the CanDo Cancer Trust in 2010 and continue to support the trust.
