  <title>Why Sam won't fight Candice</title>
  <content>
CANDICE Warner and Sam Frost may have been pitted against each other on Hell's Kitchen Australia. But the celebrity chefs will be keeping their claws safely concealed within their oven mitts.
With Warner a member of the blue team - along with Willie Mason, Gary 'Gaz' Beadle, Debra Lawrence and Issa Schultz - and Frost in the red team - with Lincoln Lewis, David Oldfield, Pettifleur Berenger and Jess Fox - the competitive women could easily have come to blows.

But instead they aligned themselves with the sisterhood.
"I don't think anyone who has met Sam could dislike her," said Warner, 32. "She's so lovely, so down to earth and just brings so much enthusiasm to the group, she's one of those girls that when she walks into the room she lights it up."
And Frost was pushed to find a bad word about the famous Iron-woman.
"You can tell she's a great mum. I'm such a supporter of women and she's just a cool chick," she said.
But when it came to Pettifleur Berrenger, the blue-eyed sweetheart had to choose her words more carefully.
"Pettifleur is an interesting cat, she talks a lot," said Frost, 28.
"I talk a lot but she's look a kookaburra! She just keeps going and going and going ... Marco had to pull her up quite a lot about the fact she just doesn't stop talking."
Read the full interview about Candice Warner's time on Hell's Kitchen Australia in this Sunday's TV guide.
