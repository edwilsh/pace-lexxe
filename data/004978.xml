  <title>Winter goes on holidays as Coast bathes in sunshine</title>
  <content>
IT'S a case of more beautiful sunshine for the Sunshine Coast, according to Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Lauren Murphy, as lifeguards report warm ocean temperatures are making for ideal swimming conditions.
Surf though is almost non-existent with lifeguard supervisor Rhys Drury saying the little bit of pulse that could be felt Sunday has backed right off with waves lucky to exceed one foot in size.
A water temperature of 21.5 degrees remains well above the August low of 19 degrees and is helping keep coastal land temperatures at a spring-like mid-twenties degrees.
Ms Murphy says an upper trough pushing through overnight on Thursday into Friday has the potential to bring some rain but expect nothing more than a light shower at most.
An increase in swell Wednesday to 1-2 metres offshore will mean little for this region's surfers, however, with Ms Murphy saying its southerly fetch would see half a metre at most refract onto our coastline.
Monday will reach a 25 degree maximum with north-westerly winds at 15-20kmh turning northerly before dropping out later this afternoon.
Tuesday's temperatures will range from 12-24 degrees on a sunny day with light winds with Wednesday a cooler 12-22 degrees on a mostly sunny day with just a slight chance of showers and light winds.
Thursday is expected to be partly cloudy on a warm day with temperatures ranging from 13 to 25 degrees and winds that will be light early then swinging from north-west to north-east at 15-20kmh before dropping out.
Expect the magic weather to continue through Friday and Saturday. Friday will be sunny with light winds and a temperature range from 11 to 24 degrees while Saturday will hit 25 degrees on a mostly sunny day with light winds early becoming north-east at 15-20kmh.
