WHEN the women's Ashes comes to Coffs Harbour for two One Day Internationals at the end of October, you can support local cricket just by attending.
Tickets for October 26 and 29 matches go on sale on Thursday with money from every ticket sold will be going directly back to the grassroots cricket community, with the Coffs Harbour District Junior Cricket Association, Nambucca Bellingen Junior Cricket Association, and Clarence River Junior Cricket Association to receive a share of the funds.
To get your tickets, visit Ticketek.
The cost of a ticket is $10 for adults and $5 for concession while kids (15 years and under) will be admitted free of charge.*^
A total of $2 from every adult and concession ticket goes to supporting your nominated local cricket association.
