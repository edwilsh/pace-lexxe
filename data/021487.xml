  <title>Ad featuring naked flight attendants criticised as</title>
  <content>
An ad for a travel company in Kazakhstan featuring models posing as naked flight attendants has been widely panned across social media.
Despite many complaints that the spot is "demeaning", "tasteless" and "unpleasant" , the advert remains online, reports .
Chocotravel ticketing service director Nikolay Mazensev said the ad is "bold and outrageous and we did not mean to offend," the  reported.
But Mazensev argues the spot "shows no less than you'd see on the beach or by the pool".
PR and communications consultant Marat Raimkhanov has called for a boycott of the Chocotravel brand, telling the BBC the ad is "a triumph of misogyny, a gesture of desperation to attract public attention. It's a total failure-socially, morally and professionally.""
Chocotravel has also rolled out a male version of the ad however that has done little to appease angry social media users with several comments pointing out that the men are dressed as pilots, reinforcing gender stereotypes.
