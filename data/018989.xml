  <title>Australian icon Maria Venuti refuses to give up after</title>
  <content>
Entertainment legend Maria Venuti might have been down, but she's far from out.
The industry veteran has been undergoing treatment and rehab since November last year after suffering a stroke induced by a confrontation with a male stalker.
A 38-year-old man carrying flowers was arrested fleeing the property at the time.
Since then, Maria and her family have been focusing on getting well and A Current Affair will reveal just how far she's come.
"They said it was one of the most catastrophic strokes they have ever seen," daughter Bianca said.
However, Maria is refusing to let it get to her - continuing to bring the music wherever she is.
The actress and entertainer, a Member of the Order of Australia, was born to an Italian father and Egyptian mother in 1941.
