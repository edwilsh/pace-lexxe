  <title>Veteran edge to Wallabies youth movement</title>
  <content>
COACH Michael Cheika named experienced duo Will Genia and Bernard Foley as the new Wallabies vice-captains but his push for regeneration otherwise dominated the Wallabies squad for the upcoming Bledisloe Cup campaign.
Cheika named seven uncapped players in his 34-man group ahead of the opening clash with New Zealand in Sydney on August 19.
Australian under-20s stars Jordan Uelese and Izzy Perese joined the senior squad, along with lock Izack Rodda, Adam Korczyk, Billy Meakes, Curtis Rona and Marika Koroibete.
The major omissions were Brumbies captain Sam Carter, who lost his spot to Kane Douglas, despite the fact the big lock couldn't make the Queensland squad at times this season.
Force backrower Richard Hardwick was also left out.
Following Michael Hooper's appointment as captain this week, Cheika turned to senior stars to act as his deputies in Genia and Foley. The coach elected to not turn to rookies like Adam Coleman, Samu Kerevi and Allan Alaalatoa.

"Will and Bernard are starting to find their voice as real leaders within the team and will be valuable assets to the captain in Michael," Cheika said in a statement.
"They have been selected because both of them are hungry to win and are prepared to keep both themselves and their team to the high standards required to take the Wallabies to be the best."
Wallabies vice-captain Will Genia said: "I really love this Wallabies team, and love any chance I get to wear the gold jersey, but to be named vice-captain really is an honour.
"I want to thank Cheik (Michael Cheika) for putting that trust in me - and I will be doing everything in my power to support Hoops (Michael Hooper) in whatever way possible alongside Bernard."
Foley said it was a "huge personal honour"
"Hoops (Hooper) is a remarkable leader, and I believe with the other leaders in the team we can compliment his style and assist him in that responsibility," Foley said.
