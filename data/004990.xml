Brett Deledio will make his Giants debut against the Demons

GREATER Western Sydney has confirmed Brett Deledio will make his long-awaited senior debut against Melbourne this week.

Deledio's move to the Giants from Richmond at the end of last season looked like being a bust when he broke down with a calf injury in February, and suffered multiple setbacks since. 

But the 30-year-old has finally been able to get a solid training block under his belt in recent weeks, and has made two successful appearances in the NEAFL to convince coach Leon Cameron that he's ready for a call-up.

The dual Tigers club champion will play his 244th AFL game when GWS takes on the Demons at UNSW Canberra Oval on Saturday, with Deledio's last senior match coming against Essendon in round 17 last season.
