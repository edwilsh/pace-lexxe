  <title>Three plead guilty to plotting Sydney terrorist acts against government buildings</title>
  <content>
Two men and a teenager have pleaded guilty to preparing terrorist attacks against government buildings in Sydney, including the Australian Federal Police.
Their trial was due to start, but the three - Sulayman Khalid, Jibryl Almaouie and a teenager who cannot be identified - pleaded guilty during proceedings in court at Parramatta today.
They are alleged to have conspired to prepare for a terrorist attack against government buildings during the period of November 7 to December 18, 2014.
The plan involved carrying out violent jihad with the use of firearms.
It was also revealed in court that three other men pleaded guilty to charges over the case earlier this year.
One man was sentenced to jail.
Sentencing submissions for five of the accused will be heard in early October.
