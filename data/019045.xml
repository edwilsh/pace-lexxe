  <title>Usain Bolt beaten in his last ever solo 100m race</title>
  <content>
Justin Gatlin has ruined Usain Bolt's farewell party by winning the world 100m title, sparking a chorus of boos from a crowd unhappy with his doping past.
Jamaican sprinter Bolt, known as the "World's Fastest Man", made a terrible start and could not make it up as Christian Coleman, the 21-year-old American who beat him in the semi-finals, looked set for victory.
But former world and Olympic champion Gatlin - the 35-year-old who stumbled at the death to lose the 2015 world final to Bolt - timed his surge and dip to perfection to win in 9.92 seconds.
Coleman took silver in 9.94 with Bolt third in 9.95.
Bolt, aged 30, will run again at the World Athletics Championships 2017 with the Jaimaican relay team.
