Conservationists say the first case of a crowdfunded beer designed to help save Tasmania's giant freshwater lobster will be sent to Federal Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg.

The species is only found in Tasmania's north, and is listed as vulnerable under federal and state law.
A review of the recovery plan was undertaken in 2015, and it was released for public consultation in August last year.
The Wilderness Society's Tasmanian campaign manager Vica Bayley said he could not understand the hold up.
"The lobster is at risk from logging, land clearing and other activities such as poaching," he said.

"We need Minister Frydenberg to sign that plan, and then we need for him to step in and make sure the Tasmanian Government does its job, declares new reserves over key areas of lobster habitat, and gives this species the best chance of survival."

"We will be sending the first case to Minister Josh Frydenberg himself," Mr Bayley said.
Giant freshwater lobster researcher Todd Walsh said urgent action was needed to protect the species.
"The wheels of government are turning really slowly for this animal," he said.
"If the plan got signed off and protocols were followed and recommendations were followed, you'd probably find this animal is going to be looked after pretty well."
