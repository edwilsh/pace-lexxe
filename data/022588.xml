  <title>Another step in Royle direction</title>

Newcastle's Aaron Royle continued his Gold Coast Commonwealth Games qualifying mission with a solid showing in Canada on Monday (AEST).  
The Rio Olympian, who has three months to convince national selectors, finished 12th overall at the ITU World Series Triathlon event in Montreal after recording the fifth fastest swim leg.  
"Legs were missing on the bike today, but salvaged a 12th at #wtsmontreal," Royle posted on Twitter. "All the pieces will come. Another step in the right direction."

This latest result for Royle follows a 16th in Edmonton, 25th in Hamburg and 12th in Leeds since returning in June from a four-month lay-off with plantar fasciitis.

Triathlon Australia performance director Justin Drew took note.

"It was a solid performance from Aaron to put himself in the race the way he did, considering he is on his way back from injury," Drew said.

Royle, who made his Commonwealth Games debut three years ago in Glasgow, wants to claim one of the two discretionary positions left on the Australian team for the Gold Coast in April.
The 27-year-old has three major chances remaining to post performances before November's cut off.
This includes the penultimate ITU World Triathlon Series round in Stockholm in three weeks and the season-ending grand final in Rotterdam next month.

Royle is this week expected to be named by Triathlon Australia in the squad for The Netherlands decider. 
He may also return home for the Noosa Triathlon in November.
