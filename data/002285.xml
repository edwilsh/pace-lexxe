  <title>Will Power settles for second in Ohio</title>
  <content>
Australia's Will Power was forced to settle for second behind American teammate Josef Newgarden at the Indycar race in Lexington, Ohio.
Newgarden overtook early leader Power on the 13th lap and was never headed to claim his third win of the season for Team Penske - and the series lead.
"We didn't have the machine to stay with him today," said Power of starting on pole for the fifth time this year.
"It wasn't my race today. I'm very happy with second."

The 26-year-old Newgarden now leads the drivers' championship on 453 points after 13 of the 17 races, seven points clear of fellow Team Penske driver Helio Castroneves with Power fifth on 401 points.
"We had an awesome race. It's what we needed," Newgarden said. "This was a good day for Team Penske."
