  <content>
A 19-year-old West Australian woman has died after being crushed by a bull while she was working at a farm.
The woman was found unconscious on Monday morning and rushed by ambulance to Esperance Hospital in WA's south where she died from her injuries a short time later.
The woman was understood to have been herding the large bull when she was hit into a fence in a paddock at Dalyup, 35km north-west of Esperance.
Worksafe are investigating and a report is being prepared for the coroner.
