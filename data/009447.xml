  <content>

ASX-listed Apollo Tourism & Leisure which bought the property, has also recently taken over the Kratzmann business for $15.6 million.

Tale of two cities

Private Chinese investor TX International has offloaded a 988sq m development site at 3 Ralph Street, Alexandria in Sydney's inner south for $8.3 million.

Colliers International's Trent Gallagher and Zhenni Lu sold the property to a local developer at $4200 a gross floor area. It already has development approval for 29 apartments and basement parking.
Reflecting the vast differences in land prices in Sydney and Melbourne, a similarly sized residential development site in Northcote in Melbourne, also approved for 29 apartments, sold for half the price in Alexandria at $4.05 million.
Caydon Property Group bought the 965.83sq m property at 2-6 McCutcheon Street, about 6 kilometres from the CBD.
It sold for $140,000 a unit whereas the Alexandria site sold for $286,207 a unit.

Colliers International's Ted Dwyer and Jeremy Gruzewski brokered the off-market deal.
60 years later

The 5565sq m site with a 2937sq m warehouse/office, workshop area and large yard sold at $1.3 million over the reserve price.

The property, purchased by a private investor, was sold with a 12-month leaseback to Prochem to allow its new facility to be completed.
CBRE's Ryan Jennings, Raj Chaudhary and John Karlovasitis managed the sale.
Hop to it
Two adjoining commercial properties at 289 & 291 Shafston Avenue in Kangaroo Point, Brisbane, have sold for $1.94 million, on a passing yield of 4 per cent.

A local private investor purchased the properties through Savills' Nick Russell and Jack Morrison, who acted for private investors.
The recently refurbished 350sq m buildings on a 767sq m site also come with car spaces and a digital billboard.
Two for one
Investors have exchanged a boutique warehouse/office and and residence at 63-65 Abbotsford Street in West Melbourne for $2.22 million at auction.

The 330sq m, two-level building on a 254sq m site is on a short-term lease.
Teska Carson's Fergus Evans and Adrian Boutsakis marketed the property.
Converted
Fronditha Aged Care has purchased a two-level purpose built as a data centre at 16 Anzed Court, Mulgrave in Melbourne, for $3 million.
Fronditha will convert the 1596sq m building, on a 5441sq m site, for occupation.
