  <title>Wendy an unlikely golf hero</title>
  <content>
THE only golfer to hit a hole-in-one during the 2017 Darwin Open weekend was 70-year-old Wendy Howard.
"I've never had a hole-in-one at all," Ms Howard said.
"I was a late starter.
"I was anti-golf, I thought it was a silly game."
The social aspect of golfing appealed to Ms Howard, who took up the sport after her father passed away in 2002.
"It gets me out the house, and it keeps me off the streets," she said.
"It's not that I go out there and thinking 'I've got to win' - it's just great to get out three or four times a week and spend the day with friends."
On Sunday, Ms Howard said she didn't realise she'd hit the hole-in-one straight away.
"I couldn't see where the ball finished - it wasn't until the observers started jumping and down and screaming out that I realised."
Darwin Golf Club captain Andrew Hullick said hitting a hole-in-one was a mix of skill and luck. "It just doesn't happen every open," he said.
For her efforts, Ms Howard won a golf cart.
