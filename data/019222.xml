Brace yourself for bleak weather across the state today.
Hailstorms threaten across Melbourne's suburbs from late morning and through the afternoon, and blizzards will continue to sweep snow across Victoria's ski fields.

Blizzard conditions bring record snow to Victoria

Thousands of skiers are expected to hit the slopes in Victoria's Alpine region in what is likely to be the "week of the season".

It will be freezing but not flooding, says Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Dean Stewart.
"There will be passing showers during today," Mr Stewart said, "but generally it is not going to be widespread rain across the Melbourne area."

Temperatures in the city will reach no higher than 13 degrees celsius, while Ballarat and Kyneton are unlikely to see double-figure temperatures, with a forecast top of only nine degrees. 

Sub-zero temperatures and wild winds  at Mount Buller, Mount Hotham and Falls Creek will see plenty more snow dumped on the ski fields in blizzard conditions.

On Saturday, Mount Hotham Skiing Company's general manager Belinda Trembath said the resort's 5000 beds were all booked out, and nearby Dinner Plain had 2500 beds.
She said strong winds could affect how many chair lifts would be open. 
"It is minus 2 degrees ... the wind is blowing quite strongly, so we could have some challenges with opening our chair lifts up high," Ms Trembath said. 
"We have got 12 of 13 [chair lifts] planned to open, and we'll see how we go with the winds."
Strong wind gusts of up to 80 kilometres per hour buffeted the state over Saturday night, especially near Port Phillip Bay, fuelled by the gales that have already swept across South Australia. 
The bleak midwinter mood will continue into Monday, as Mr Stewart says there will be further showers overnight and into the start of the week. 
But the days will start to warm up midweek, with Wednesday's top temperature expected to be 16 degrees and Thursday peaking at a positively balmy 18 degrees.
