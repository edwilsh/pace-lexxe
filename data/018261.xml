  <content>
A Melbourne man has faced court with cuts on his forehead and a bruised eye after he allegedly drove at speed on a footpath near a school, narrowly avoiding children.
Tyson Anthony Vidal, 34, is accused of driving a stolen car on the wrong side of the road at the Mornington Peninsula on Friday afternoon before a dramatic arrest at a petrol station in Clayton.
Vidal faced Melbourne Magistrates' Court charged with seven offences, including driving on a footpath while children were in the area, endangering their lives.
