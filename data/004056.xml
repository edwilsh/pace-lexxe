  <title>Net explodes after Mooch sacking</title>
  <content>
ANTHONY Scaramucci's sacking after only 10 days as White House communications director has provided incredible fodder for wits on social media.
Here's the best of what we've seen:

Celebrities got in on the act, including Kate Hudson, and former West Wing star Bradley Whitford:

For perspective, The Mooch was part of our lives for the gestation period of a Virginian Opossum. I looked it up.

Spent the last 10 days in north Ontario away from internet reach. The Mooch is like a comet I slept through only to hear how glorious it was

Monica Lewinsky got more done in The Oval Office than The Mooch.

Wonder if a "Mooch" will become a measurement in time... "going on our honeymoon for almost two Mooches"

Right now Mooch is probably ranting insanely to some lucky reporter, on the record, and it's all on tape

White House insider Katrina Pierson tweeted her thoughts - but it was unclear whether her objective was humour or not.

FWIW:  was fired at 8am but the press found out when the WH shop released it in the afternoon. Apparently, he stopped the leaks.
