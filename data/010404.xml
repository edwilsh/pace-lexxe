  <title>Government moves to freeze Clive Palmer's assets</title>
  <content>
The Federal Government will today make significant moves to recoup $70 million in taxpayers money that was paid out to Queensland Nickel workers. 
Government appointed liquidators have reportedly applied to freeze $200 million of Clive Palmer's assets to recoup money taxpayers gave to the former politician's mining business.
The assets include his super yacht, golf courses, 15 properties, vintage cars and his 100 per cent shareholdings in Nickel House and associated businesses which all are estimated to be worth around 200 million dollars. 

The Courier Mail reports that the application also demands that the "unencumbered value of QNI Metals and assets must not dip below $49,993,120.74; QNI Resources retain value of almost $200,000; Mineralogy retain almost $16.5 million; Fairway Coal retain about $9 million and Waratah Coal about $2 million."
The application will also ask that Mr Palmer be made to live "a reasonable lifestyle" and only pay a "reasonable" amount in legal costs. 
It aims to ensure his businesses can still trade.

In January 2016 Queensland Nickel went into voluntary administration and hundreds of workers lost entitlements.
