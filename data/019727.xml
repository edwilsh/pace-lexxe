  <title>Flannel to build on US success</title>
  <content>
WEST coast fashion label Flannel is preparing for major global expansion next month, with plans to present collections in Los Angeles, New York and at the Telstra Perth Fashion Festival.
It's been five years since WA designer Kristy Lawrence and husband John began the brand's American expansion and the label now has 10 Australian stores, one LA boutique and more than 100 wholesale accounts in the US. Next month they open their second US store in Nolita, New York.
Lawrence said the move had more than paid off with Flannel's turnover from its Australian and American operations exceeding $10 million and growing.
"We decided we wanted full control of how the stores looked and how the clothes were presented," Lawrence said.
"With the Australian economy, wholesale would have been hard, so the plan was to do our own stores in Australia and focus on wholesale in the US."
Working behind the scenes with Lawrence is her tight-knit family including her husband, sister Brooke Anderson and sister-in-law Anna Koutsoukis.
Sitting front row at Flannel's Telstra Perth Fashion Festival event will be a delegation from the China Fashion Association.
Flannel will present its upcoming collection alongside celebrated WA label One Fell Swoop on Friday September 15.
Telstra Perth Fashion Festival runs September 6-17. For tickets, go to:
