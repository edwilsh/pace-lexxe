  <title>Mary in trouble for ref critique</title>
  <content>
Paul McGregor was livid after his side's loss to the Knights last weekend.

Dragons coach Paul McGregor is facing a $10,000 fine after being issued with a breach notice for his attack on the NRL referees following Saturday's loss to Newcastle.
McGregor is the first coach this year to face sanction for criticising match officials, having called them "embarrassing and incompentent" after the match.
"The rule is that coaches, players and officials should not discuss referees and their performances in the public domain," NRL head of football Brian Canavan said.
Ricky Stuart escaped a fine for launching a tirade on match officials after the Raiders' loss to Melbourne the previous week.
Canavan said McGregor's comments crossed the line.
McGregor was livid at three key decisions that went against his side, including two calls that denied his team tries in the 21-14 loss.
"Anyone who knows rugby league would agree because the ball went back on the Nightingale one and it should have been overruled and it wasn't," he said. "And Hodkinson took a dive."
