  <title>'Cash Me Outside' girl avoids jail for grand theft and drug possession</title>
  <content>
The "Cash Me Outside" girl has narrowly avoided jail after being sentenced to five years' probation for a string of crimes.

Danielle Bregoli, 14, walked free from a Florida court on Tuesday after she pled guilty to two counts of grand theft, marijuana possession and filing a false police statement,  reports.

The outlandish teen's offences predate her appearance of Dr Phil last September, where she became internet famous for her bad attitude and catch phrases, "cash me outside" and "how bow dat".

A Florida judge said the teenager would be allowed to complete her probation in California where she lives with her mother.

Last month Bregoli sued an app developer after they used her catch phrases as game titles.

The lawsuit called for at least $1 million in damages, citing the fact the teen had made the phrases popular, and people were cashing in on her influence.
