Sam Mitchell is expected to announce his retirement on Wednesday

WEST Coast has called a media conference for 10am AWST on Wednesday at which Brownlow medallist Sam Mitchell is expected to announce his retirement.

Mitchell, 34, sensationally was traded by Hawthorn to the Eagles at the end of last season after 307 games and four premierships with the Hawks.

At the time, it was confirmed that Mitchell would transition into a coaching role after a period as a player.

It is expected that his playing days will end when the Eagles' season is over.

Mitchell was awarded the 2012 Brownlow Medal, along with Richmond captain Trent Cotchin, in a special ceremony in December last year after Essendon champion Jobe Watson returned his medal as part of the fallout from the Bombers' supplements saga.

If Mitchell calls time on Wednesday, he will be the second Eagle Brownlow winner to retire in a week, with 2014 medallist Matt Priddis announcing last Friday that he would hang up the boots at the end of the season.

Mitchell was recruited from the Box Hill Hawks in the VFL, and made his debut for Hawthorn in 2002.

He won five best and fairest awards with Hawthorn, including last season, after winning the NAB AFL Rising Star award in 2003.

Mitchell was named All Australian three times, and captained the Hawks for three seasons from 2008-10, winning the flag in the first of those years.
