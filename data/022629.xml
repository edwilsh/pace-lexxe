WATCH the emotional moment a newborn baby clings onto her mother's face after meeting her for the first time.
Agata Ribeiro Coelho was born via caesarean on April 5 in Santa Monica Hospital, Brazil.
The bub was placed on her adoring mother, Brenda Coelho de Souza, 24, and the connection was instant.
Agata appears to kiss her mother's cheek as the medical team watch on in awe.
Brenda, an administrative assistant, said: "It was an incredible moment when my daughter hugged me for the first time."
"The medical team were great and were all really surprised that she acted this way, they couldn't believe how affectionate she was with me.
"Agata is now three months old and is doing great, every day is a surprise and I love being a mother."
