  <title>'Mayweather-McGregor will be s***'</title>
  <content>
AMIR KAHN has said that Floyd Mayweather's highly anticipated fight against Conor McGregor will be a "sh*t fight" and a wholly one-sided contest.
The British boxer wanted to fight the reigning Irish UFC lightweight champion prior to the Mayweather fight announcement.
"I think it's going to be a sh*t fight," the former unified light-welterweight world champion told Gulf News.
"It's all just talk at the moment. Mayweather will simply outclass him.
"I mean, if you look at it, it's not really a fight. McGregor has no boxing background and experience.
"I can safely predict a horrible knockout," said Khan.
The 30-year-old applauds the Irishman's approach to the fight from a business aspect, but admits that his chances of beating the 49-0 American are slim.
"McGregor has nothing to lose in that sense, and at the end of it all, he will make a cool $100 (Â£77m). It's good business."
Khan contemplated a move back to MMA in March after being spotted ringside at UFC 208.
The British boxer said: "Mayweather will have his first knockout since he knocked out Ricky Hatton. He's not had a KO for the past six years.
"But with this one against McGregor he is bound to be an easy winner." the 30-year-old predicted.
"It would be a great way for Mayweather to end this is he knocks out a MMA superstar like McGregor, who very well knows that this is a free fight for him.
"You know why? Because he can go back and just turn around and say that he's lost a boxing fight to an actual boxer.
"He can always say 'I have never been a boxer. I've always been an MMA fighter'. McGregor has nothing to loose."
The British Olympian hit the headlines this week following his bitter love split with partner Faryal Makhdoom.
