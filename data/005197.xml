Vodafone Hutchison Australia added 190,000 new customers to take its subscriber base to 5.7 million, while increasing revenue and earnings in the first half of 2017.
Australia's third-ranked telco has reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation (EBITDA) of $477 million in the six months to June 30, up 15.9 per cent from a year ago, while its net loss for the period was $81.5 million - down from $164 million.
VHA, a 50/50 joint venture between Vodafone Group and Hutchison Whampoa, said average revenue per user (ARPU) had grown two per cent in the six month period to $45.89, however, on a year on year basis ARPU was down 5.7 per cent.
Shares in ASX-listed Hutchison Telecommunications were up 0.3 cents to 6.4 cents at 1525.
