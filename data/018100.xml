  <title>Baker feels the burn as Sun shines</title>

TRAINER Bjorn Baker hasn't lost faith in boom colt Addictive Nature despite his shock defeat at the hands of Queenslander Shogun Sun at Randwick.
In fact the youngster's brave performance confirmed to Baker that he's a smart horse in the making. After being softened up in the lead facing the breeze, Addictive Nature ($2.45) was a sitting shot but fought off all challengers until Shogun Sun ($20) burst through to ambush him.
Solar Patch ($9), who pressured the favourite held on for third.
"It was a step up for him but he ran a very good race, we'll see how he comes through but we'll push on to either the Ming Dynasty in three weeks or the Up and Coming in two weeks,'' Baker said. "He's smart but he's going to have to be smarter next time in a stronger race.''
The Group 3 Up and Coming Stakes (1300m) is run at Randwick on August 19 and the Group 3 Ming Dynasty (1400m) at Rosehill a week later.
Shogun Sun was the most experienced of the six runners in the walking2help.com.au Handicap (1200m) and he needed all that knowledge to squeeze through a gap at the 200m.
Jockey Christian Reith was quite taken with the win and was rapt to get the cash for trainer Kelly Schweida.
"He was quite impressive, he always travelled well in the run,'' Reith said. "They didn't go overly quick and we just needed a split, we got it and once he got through he really impressed me. He's a big baby and Kelly was telling me that the other night when I was speaking to him. He's a good friend of mine and it's good for him and the connections, they have a nice horse.''
There were no excuses for the well backed Brave Song ($2.60) who loomed but didn't finish the race off as expected.
