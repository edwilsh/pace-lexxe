  <title>Instafamous Honey Belle loves her cafe break</title>
  <content>
NOT every dog can boast 419 followers on Instagram.
But Honey Belle the miniature dachshund is not any dog.
Despite being born only 13 weeks ago, Honey Belle has racked up over 400 followers on the popular social media platform, with the help of her human mother Mallory Lloyd.
The cute pooch was born in Ingham in a litter of seven, and only moved to Cairns with Ms Lloyd three weeks ago.
"We have been recording her life in Cairns (on Instagram)" Ms Lloyd said. "She's very spoiled, but she's very, very loved. We're part of a dachshund group here in Cairns, so we go to a lot of birthday parties with dachshunds."
Ms Lloyd enjoys taking her to markets and shops, and dog- friendly cafes on the weekends.
