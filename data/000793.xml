  <title>Two empty blocks in Point Cook estate soar past reserves - realestate.com.au</title>
  <content>
A vacant block of land at 27 Rhode Island Close in Point Cook's Sanctuary Lakes estate sold for $731,000 on Saturday.

TWO empty blocks of land in the "Toorak of the west" fetched about three-quarters of a million dollars each, as Melbourne's winter auction market sizzled on the weekend.
The city notched a preliminary clearance rate of 77.2 per cent from 943 auctions last week, up from the previous week's 73.8 per cent from 833.

A local family bought the 593sq m block.

A neighbouring block at 28 Rhode Island Close also sold strongly under the hammer for $725,000.

CoreLogic data also shows five of Melbourne's nine subregions recorded sale rates above 80 per cent, led by the Mornington Peninsula with a 87.2 per cent success rate from 39 reported auctions.
Neighbouring vacant blocks in Point Cook's up-market Sanctuary Lakes estate were fiercely sought by upsizing families at back-to-back auctions on Saturday.
At least five bidders pushed a 593sq m allotment at $121,000 past reserve to a selling price of $731,000.
Hocking Stuart Point Cook director Scott Perry said the result "far exceeded everyone's expectations" due to "immense" competition.
Its 571sq m neighbour at fetched $725,000, $85,000 above reserve, following a contest between four bidders.
Mr Perry said a local family bought the first block, and a young couple who'd missed out on the first snapped up the second.
Both buyers plan to build their dream homes on the sites, which back on to the lake.
"Sanctuary Lakes is a very popular area - it's the Toorak of the west," Mr Perry said.
"It's one of the last remaining spots you can pick up land with water views."
MORE AUCTION COVERAGE:

A church group bought this worn house at 12 Bridge St, Werribee for its "activity centre" zoned block.

The rezoning means the buyer will be able to build up to eight-storeys on the site.

In nearby Werribee, a church group outlasted about eight other bidders to buy recently rezoned house on a 487sq m block at .
They paid $678,000 against a $600,000 reserve.
Advantage Property Consulting director Frank Valentic said the sellers had benefited from their home being rezoned as an "activity centre" last year, allowing up to eight storeys to be built in its place.
"Owners in this zone have won Tattslotto - some of their properties have increased in value by 20 to 30 per cent," he said.
YPA Wyndham City auctioneer James Risos said a mix of developers and investors competed for the site, which was occupied by a "pretty worn" two-bedroom house.
He said he didn't know what the buyers planned to do with it, but expected the church group to ultimately develop, perhaps seeking one of the neighbouring properties to expand the site.
In Hampton, Beckett director Thomas Georgiou watched a renovated California bungalow at soar at least $310,000 past reserve to fetch $2.51 million.

41 Imbros St, Hampton sold for $310,000 above reserve.

Four bidders put their hands up for the house.

Mr Georgiou said more than 100 people watched the five-bedroom house sell, with a man who opened the bidding at $1.9 million outlasting three other contenders to take the keys.
And Wakelin Property Advisory associate director Jarrod McCabe saw two sides of the Melbourne apartment market.
He said a one-bedroom South Yarra apartment at a price point within the first-home buyer stamp duty discount range sold strongly for $555,000.
Four bidders, including investors and a first-timer, pushed  past its $512,000 reserve.
But a renovated two-bedroom apartment at  passed in at $805,000 after being quoted at $780,000-$850,000.
Mr McCabe said the stamp duty concessions had "certainly drawn more people" into the Melbourne market.
