  <title>Student pilot crashes light plane on US highway</title>
  <content>
A light plane being flown by a student pilot has crashed onto a US highway with the dashcam of a passing car filming the accident.

The video shows the Cessna 150 dipping low as it crosses over the highway in Texas and continuing to plummet towards the ground on Tuesday local time, KLTV reports.

The plane crosses over the highway and lands in a ditch on the other side of the busy road.

The 36-year-old student pilot Joshua Daniel, 36, was taken to hospital in a serious condition.

His instructor, Jamie Jackson, 33, has been treated for minor injuries and was released from hospital.

Family members say the pair were practicing field runs and doing grass landings at a nearby landing strip.
