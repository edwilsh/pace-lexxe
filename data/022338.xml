  <title>Pedestrian hit by train in Hampton</title>
  <content>
A PEDESTRIAN has been hit by a train in Hampton, with train services on the Sandringham line suspended.
Emergency services are at the scene, with boom gates down at Hampton St and police saying they are expected to remain down for several hours.
Police are urging commuters to avoid the area.

This will go right through the PM peak. I have no doubt about that. Horrible.
