Nicole Kidman says Horn v Pacquiao rematch should be in Sydney
Concerns had been raised about the ability of Brisbane to host an outdoor fight in the later months of the year, given the summer heat and the threat of storms.
It's understood plans for the fight include bringing air-conditioners in to Suncorp.
Pacquiao has a rematch clause in his contract for a return fight at Suncorp in November
The much-anticipated rematch comes after an epic July 2 battle, which Horn won in a 12-round points decision in front of 51,000 people.
Australia's biggest ever boxing event propelled the Brisbane schoolteacher into international stardom.
