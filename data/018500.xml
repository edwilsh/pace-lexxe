  <title>Man charged with Bathurst attempted murder</title>
  <content>
A man has been charged with attempted murder after another man was found with severe injuries in his home at Bathurst in central western NSW.
Emergency services were called to the home following reports of an assault on Wednesday.
A 48-year-old man was treated by paramedics at the scene for head, abdomen and leg injuries before being flown to a Sydney hospital in a critical condition.
The man's wife found him barely conscious and he was placed in an induced coma, Fairfax Media reported.
Police launched an investigation and on Saturday arrested a 24-year-old man at Raymond Terrace Police station - more than 300 kilometres away.
He was charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to murder.
He was refused bail and will appear at Newcastle Local Court on August 6.
