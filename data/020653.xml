Naracoorte has its own Commonwealth Games medallist after Jess Trengove finished third in the women's marathon on Sunday night.

With all of Australia watching live on TV, the former Naracoorte athlete, now based in Adelaide, ran a personal best time of 2 hours 30.12 to claim the bronze medal in a stunning performance.

In front of her friends and family who had travelled to Glasgow, Scotland, to watch her race, Trengove burst into tears after crossing the finishing line as the realisation of what she had achieved hit home.

Two other Australians finished in the top 10, with Melanie Panayiotou eighth and Sarah Klein 10th.

It capped off a great couple of hours for Australian distance running after Michael Shelley had won the gold medal in the men's marathon.
