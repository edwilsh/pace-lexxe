  <title>'Confused' Gilmore makes stunning early exit</title>
  <content>
AUSSIE great Stephanie Gilmore has suffered a shock elimination on the opening day of the US Open of Surfing, losing to wildcard Maud Le Car.
But star compatriots Tyler Wright and Sally Fitzgibbons both progressed to the third round at California's Huntington Beach.
Gilmore, a six-time world champion, was sent to the elimination second round after losing her first-round heat to Hawaiian defending champion Tatiana Weston-Webb in 1.2-1.5m waves.
Gilmore also failed to hit her straps against Frenchwoman Le Car, who posted a combined score of 10.84 (out of 20) to 8.90.
"My positioning in round one was really bad," Gilmore said.
"I was too close to the pier, so my plan this time was to really stay up a bit and maybe find a right.
"I don't know, I couldn't really find them and the lefts are pretty hard to surf - super fast and steep.
"I was a little confused out there. Disappointing result, for sure."
Defending world champion Wright, looking to cement her place at the top of this year's leaderboard, beat Coco Ho and Le Car in her first-round heat thanks to a two-turn ride scored 7.10.
Fitzgibbons defeated fellow Aussie Keely Andrew and South Africa's Bianca Buitendag, while countrywoman Nikki Van Dijk also won in the first round.
World No.2 Fitzgibbons was a convincing winner in her heat - almost two points ahead of Andrew - but anticipated a tough contest at the Open.
"Any of the surfers on tour can take this event out," she said.
"That creates a lot of excitement in me and even right to the buzzer, you know you've never got a heat won.
"You're kind of just on the hustle."
Andrew, Bronte Macaulay and Laura Enever were all eliminated in the second round.
