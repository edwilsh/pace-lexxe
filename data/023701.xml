  <title>Skimpies on itinerary as Diggers and Dealers gets into full swing</title>
  <content>
It's early days and we know - given the context - that this is a big call, but we think we may have found the digging-est event on this year's Diggers and Dealers calendar.
To wit: the inaugural MacEquity/Taylor David Kalgoorlie pub crawl. 
As the invitation states: "Gents" (because apparently no chicks are invited) "Three pubs have been marked out for which cheap drinks, complimentary canapes and an array of entertainment will be on offer."
An attached schedule goes on to enumerate the itinerary, which includes The York Hotel, The Criterion and The Exchange Hotel (twice).

Why, we asked organiser Jason Skinner, did The Exchange warrant a return visit? Was it because it is one of Kalgoorlie's premier "Skimpie" pubs (female bar staff dressed in lingerie or swimwear), or was it because it had the best mixed grill? 

"We're mates with the publican," he told us, boasting his pub crawl was on track to attract 45 participants ... presumably all-male. "He gives us a good deal."
Sure, Jase, whatever you say.
