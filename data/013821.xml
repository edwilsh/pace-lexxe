  <title>Marijuana farm's location won't stay secret forever</title>
  <content>
YET another big hype article about growing medicinal marijuana on the Sunshine Coast and a photo opportunity for a Federal MP (Daily, August 1).
The company involved states that secrecy of location and security is paramount to the operation; it will be interesting to see how long something stays a secret around here especially when politicians get invited to view operations.
Norfolk Island was the ideal place to set up such an industry being a small isolated island in the South Pacific approximately midway between Australia and New Zealand.
No one could get on or off the island without it being known, so security was simple.
The Norfolk Island Government approved the establishment of a medicinal marijuana industry in 2014 but the legislation was vetoed by the Australian Government's 'colonial dictatorship'.
This industry would have provided Norfolk Island with a second major industry to augment tourism plus medicinal marijuana would have been available to patients by the end of 2015.
