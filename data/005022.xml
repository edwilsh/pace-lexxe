  <title>Drugged drivers caught near SA schools</title>
  <content>
Twenty drivers have been caught near school zones in South Australia with drugs in their system, including six who either dropping off or collecting children.
Police conducted the crackdown on Monday with most of the positive tests coming in the Adelaide metropolitan area but also in the Murray Mallee and SA's mid-north.
Superintendent Anthony Fioravanti says the actions of those involved were putting children at risk.
