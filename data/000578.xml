  <title>Canberrans from both sides of politics call for poker machine reform</title>

Up to 80 per cent of Canberrans want major gaming reform, support mandatory pre-commitment and $1 spins for poker machines, a new poll shows.

The strong support for $1 spins and mandatory pre-commitment - where voters decide upfront how much they are prepared to lose - comes in the face of Labor and Liberal opposition to both measures.
The are insisting on both as a pre-condition of their support for poker machines in the casino - but there is no political will to extend the measures into clubs, which run Canberra's 5000 poker machines.

The Reachtel poll for Anglicare and the Canberra Gambling Reform Alliance was conducted on July 27, with 717 people polled, and a margin of error of 3.6 per cent.
It showed Labor support down five points since the October election last year, to 33.5 per cent. By the time Labor-leaning undecided voters were added, Labor's support was 36.4 per cent, compared with its 2016 vote of 38.4 per cent.

Liberal support was down almost two points to 34.9 per cent, but by the time Liberal-leaning undecideds were factored in the Liberals had a healthy lead in the poll, at 38.8 per cent (2016 result: 36.7).

With the Green-leading undecideds, the Greens were showing 13.3 per cent support in the July poll, three points up on their 2016 result.
The shift against the government and the 10 per cent undecided voters is not unexpected a year after the election, and fits with the result of the 2016 election where anger against Labor didn't ultimately dent its support, with votes returning to the party on voting day either directly or via preferences.
But the strength of feeling about poker machines will buoy the Greens in their campaign for tight gambling laws in a week where the government is expected to introduce its package of poker machine reforms.
The Labor-Greens power-sharing agreement includes a reduction in poker machine numbers by mid-2020 from 5000 to 4000, but the government is yet to say how it will reduce numbers.
And it appears Canberrans might not be as concerned with poker machine numbers as with restrictions on how much money can be spent at a time.
The poll found 43 percent want a "large decrease" in numbers of poker machines in their "local community", with 18 per cent wanting a "small decrease", and 31 per cent saying numbers should stay about the same.
Of those polled, 17 per cent said they had played poker machines in the past two months, with the biggest players among the 18-24 year old age group, at 27 per cent - although the relatively small numbers render those findings less than secure.
Anglicare chief executive Jeremy Halcrow said the most significant message from the poll was the broad support for change across age groups and Labor and Liberal voters.
"Support for gambling reform in the ACT crosses party lines," he said. "This shows that gambling reform is not a matter of partisan politics, it is a matter of public health and safety."
He also highlighted the finding that three-quarters of people polled wanted to see the compulsory community contributions from clubs administered by an independent body. At the moment clubs direct their community contributions largely to their sporting codes.
"It is very clear that Canberrans are sceptical that the clubs will distribute the proceeds from poker machines in the most appropriate way," Mr Halcrow said. "We strongly believe that the ACT government must put in place an independent body that is not captured by industry."
In other findings:

70 per cent say poker machines do more harm than good.

78 per cent want a $250-a-day limit on cash from eftpos machines in clubs.

Canberra Gambling Reform Alliance co-chairwoman Rebecca Vassarotti, a Greens candidate in the 2016 election, said that the poll should spark "real action on reform".
"The strength of community support for reasonable measures to prevent community harm is a wake-up call for politicians who have been frightened into inaction by industry," she said.
Mr Halcrow said Anglicare's frontline saw the damaged caused by poker machines and was concerned that the rules governing poker machines were weighted against vulnerable people.
"The limited harm prevention measures that are in place are very weak compared to those found overseas and in most other states."
