  <title>Greg credits Donna Hay for buff body</title>
  <content>
GOLFING great Greg Norman has credited Aussie home cook Donna Hay with his recent buff body transformation.
A couple of weeks after sharing a naked snap on Instagram, the 62-year-old has declared he's a fan of Hay's style of home cooking.

"Wonderful surprise from my fav chef @donna.hay - adding to our collection," Norman wrote as he held several of Hay's cook books.
"Thanks to my mum @toinianorman and @kirstenpnorman for introducing me to her balanced & delicious approach to eating. 'It's not about the diet, it's about the way food makes you feel' - so true! Thanks Donna!!! Am a big fan!"
Mid last month, the three-time married Norman made headlines around the world by sharing a nude shot of himself washing in a river in Colorado Flat Top Wilderness. Earlier this year he sported a leg brace and underwent treatment for a torn ligament.
Clearly he's made a full recovery thanks to exercise and healthy eating.
"Greg is looking fabulous, I'm a fan of his too," Hay told Confidential. "And if I've played any part in his healthy living, I'm thrilled."
