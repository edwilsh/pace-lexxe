  <title>Fiji keen to rise up the ranks at AFL International Cup</title>
  <content>
As the lowest ranked side in the men's first division, the team from Fiji will go in to the AFL International Cup in Melbourne this weekend as clear under dogs.
They open their campaign against France on Sunday, which on paper should be an even contest, but then they face tough match-ups against New Zealand and South Africa, the teams that finished third and fourth three years ago.
Along with defending champions PNG and Ireland, those two are likely to be in the shake-up for a spot in the Grand Final to be played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, as a curtain raiser for the AFL showdown between Collingwood and Geelong.
Fiji though are not expected to make it to the big stage, but their coach, Simon Highfield, is expecting his fitter, stronger team to continue their steady climb up the world ladder.
