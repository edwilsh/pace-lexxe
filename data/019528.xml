You might think beating three of the top teams in the world in quick succession would satisfy Matildas coach Alen Stajcic, but no.
Australia beat the United States for the first time, then Japan, then ruthlessly , to raise hopes it could make waves in the championships that really count over the next three years.
Asked if everything had gone right in the US, Stajcic said he was happy with the way things went, but expects even more from his players.
"Sam Kerr said to me after the last game, 'are you happy now?' and my answer was a typical 'no'," he told the ABC upon his return to Australia.
"We've got a lot of work still to do.
"We're a work in progress, we're a very young team.

"Our goal, and we've set a high ambition, is to win the World Cup. So we have to be a lot better going forward."
Stajcic said the team had turned its pre-tournament confidence into positive results on the pitch, beginning with the morale-boosting win over the US.
"The way that the players came in, there was just a newfound maturity - a level of confidence within the team, even before game one," he said.
"And getting the just rewards in that first match against USA just really built upon all the things that we'd worked on off the field.
"It gave the group a lot of confidence, and not just this week, forever."
Even considering the groundbreaking win over the US, it was the 6-1 demolition of Brazil which really raised eyebrows in Australia and across the footballing world.
But Stajcic insisted he and his players would not be getting ahead of themselves, but instead working even harder to achieve their goals over the coming few years.
"At the end of the day we've got to keep everything in perspective.
"This was a friendly tournament where all the teams are trying different things out and it gives us a lot of confidence, but the big three tournaments are coming up.
"We've got the Asian Cup in April next year, we've got the World Cup the year after and the Olympics the year after.
"You always need a bit of luck in major tournaments, but the way this team's tracking, if we keep improving, there's nothing to say we can't be playing for medals in a couple of years' time."
