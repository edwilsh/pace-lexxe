  <title>Vic bikies charged over tattoo shop fires</title>
  <content>
Nine bikies have been charged after two Melbourne tattoo parlours were destroyed by fire.
The men, who police have linked to the outlaw Finks gang, allegedly caused $250,000 damage to the two shops at Seville and Lilydale, which were set on fire in May.
They have each been charged with arson and burglary and six will face Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, with the remainder scheduled for Thursday.
