  <title>SA coroner probes hospital stroke deaths</title>
  <content>
An inquest is set to open into the deaths of two men who suffered strokes and died in the Royal Adelaide Hospital at a time when two clot-busting stroke specialists were on leave.
South Australian Coroner Mark Johns will take his first evidence on Wednesday as he begins to investigate the deaths of 60-year-old Michael John Russell and 87-year-old Leslie Robert Graham.
Mr Graham was admitted to the RAH in April after suffering a stroke at home.
He was assessed as a suitable candidate for the delicate clot retrieval procedure but one specialist was overseas and the other on a fishing trip, south of Adelaide.
A similarly qualified specialist was called in from the Flinders Medical Centre to perform the procedure but it proved unsuccessful.
Mr Russell was admitted to the hospital the same day suffering from a heart attack but had a stroke while undergoing a procedure to clear a blocked artery.
He was also worked on by the visiting specialist, who had been called back, but again the procedure proved unsuccessful.
