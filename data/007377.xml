  <title>Watson to wait on future call</title>
  <content>
DON'T expect Jobe Watson to join the growing list of players announcing their retirement just yet.
Essendon coach John Worsfold said "at this stage" a decision on Watson's future wouldn't be made until the end of the season and he hoped any potential conversation about a possible send off game would be thwarted by a finals appearance.
"Hopefully not, because you can't plan a farewell game in the finals, that's our aim," Worsfold said.
"You don't know when your last game is going to be.
"Ultimately at this stage I'll be sitting down with Jobe post-season and talking about where we're at as a club, where he's at. That decision will be made on the balance of the whole season"
Worsfold said he hadn't spoken to Watson about his form, which the coach had been "pretty happy with".
RETIRING:
"I think he's working really hard," Worsfold said.
"He hasn't been best on ground every week but he's still helped us become a pretty competitive team."
Defender Patrick Ambrose is a chance to return for Saturday's crunch game against Carlton. Ambrose has recovered from quad injuries and has played two games in the VFL.
Forward Josh Green is available with Worsfold declaring "he's flying on the track".
