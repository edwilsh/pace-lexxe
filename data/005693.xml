  <title>Rose ready to bloom in spring</title>

SUNSHINE Coast trainer David Vandyke will campaign his star four-year-old mare Yankee Rose exclusively in Melbourne this spring with another tilt at the Cox Plate a possibility for her.
On Tuesday Yankee Rose narrowly won a 1270m trial at the Sunshine Coast and Vandyke plans to get her to Melbourne shortly saying he intends to get her on a flight as soon as he can.
Vandyke said Yankee Rose would kick-off her spring campaign in the $1 million Memsie Stakes (1400m) at Caulfield on September 2.
After that she will run in the $750,000 Makybe Diva Stakes (1600m) at Flemington on September 16 and then the $750,000 Underwood Stakes (1800m) at Caulfield on October 1.
"After that I'll decide whether she will head towards the Caulfield Cup or the Cox Plate again," Vandyke said.
He said he wanted Yankee Rose's spring campaign to be in the one place as he didn't think it would suit her being shifted around.
Yankee Rose hasn't started since she finished 14th as the $1.95 favourite in the VRC Oaks.
Vandyke said that run was a non-event as she pulled up with bone chips. Prior to that she finished third in the Cox Plate after winning the Spring Champion Stakes at Royal Randwick.
Vandyke said jockey Dean Yendall would keep the ride for the spring. The trainer brought her back into work for the Sydney carnival but abandoned that after she suffered hoof problems.
Vandyke then gave her a short let-up before returning her to work.
"She's been in work for 21 weeks. The owners have been very patient and they've let me put a lot of slow work into her to build her back up," he said.
Vandyke said Yankee Rose wasn't the sort of mare who won trials easily as she saved herself for race day. He said Yankee Rose had made good but not significant development physically.
