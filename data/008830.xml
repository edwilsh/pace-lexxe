  <content>
A Gold Coast woman has been severely bashed and had her luxury car stolen after challenging a man she saw trying to break into an apartment building.
After the 54-year-old was punched repeatedly in the face her attacker stole her silver Mercedes, which was found at Coolangatta in the early hours of Wednesday.
"She saw a man attempting to gain entry to a locked stairwell leading to a unit," police said.
A man in the car has been arrested, but officers also want to question another man, Dylan Slingsby, over the incident.
"Anyone who sees Slingsby should not to approach him but call police immediately," police said.
