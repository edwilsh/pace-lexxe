Police are seeking to identify a man seen near the location of a deliberately-lit house fire in Devonport.
The property at 3/151 Tasman Street was completely destroyed in the fire which was lit about 4pm Friday.
Detective Constable David Fitzgerald said police were following a specific line of inquiry into the fire which caused an estimated $200,000 damage.
"Tasmania Fire Service extinguished the blaze, however unfortunately the property was completely destroyed," he said today.
"We would like to speak to anyone who may have information about the fire, particularly anyone who may have seen a male person walking in the street shortly before 4pm.
"The occupant was not home at the time of the fire and nobody suffered injuries as a result."
The property is owned by Housing Tasmania.
A house at Port Arthur was also destroyed by fire on Friday evening, causing an estimated $400,000 worth of damage.
The fire service said the cause of that fire was accidental, and was possibly an electrical fault.
Information can be provided anonymously by calling Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000, online at crimestopperstas.com.au or 131444.
