  <title>Rain, hail or shine - duty is never done</title>
  <content>
A sea of umbrellas is forming outside Buckingham palace, with rain unlikely to deter those present to farewell Prince Philip.
The Duke of Edinburgh will attend his last official public engagement with a Captain General's parade of the Royal Marines in London on Wednesday.
"Well you can't change the weather and you can't change the Prince," James Ellard MBE said under an ominous sky.
Mr Ellard served seven years as a marine and says he is sad to see his captain go.
His companion and fellow former marine for 12 years, Norman Saints agreed, saying Prince Philip had been a good leader.
"Well he's a sailor, isn't he?"
Wednesday will be his 22,219th solo engagement since 1953, Buckingham Palace said.
The announcement in May that the Duke was stepping down came after a day of much media speculation that the steadfast companion of the Queen for 70 years, may have died.
However retiring at the age of 96, the Duke, who is the longest-serving consort in British history and also the oldest serving partner of a reigning monarch, is reported to be in good health.
