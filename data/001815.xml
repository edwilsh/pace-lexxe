  <title>Saints legend Nick Riewoldt is retiring</title>
  <content>
St Kilda veteran Nick Riewoldt will retire at the end of the year after 17 seasons with the Saints.

The 2002 rising star, now 34, has played 333 with the club and was the St Kilda captain for a record 11 seasons - in 2005, and then from 2007 to 2016.

Riewoldt was named the AFL Players' Association most valuable player in 2004 and has kicked 714 goal in his career. He's a five time All Australian and took out the club's best and fairest six times between 2002 and 2014. He led the team in losing Grand Finals in 2009 and 2010

Many feared his career would come to a sudden end in at the start of the season when hyperextended his right knee in the opening round loss to Melbourne and had to be stretchered from the field, but Riewoldt was back for round three.

"I'm content knowing that we gave it an absolute crack [to win a premiership], and we fell short," Riewoldt said at today's announcement.

"I have no fears about what's next."
