Marley Williams has been ruled out for the rest of the season

NORTH Melbourne defender Marley Williams will miss the rest of the season after being ruled out with a back injury.

The ex-Pie needs surgery and will also be assessed for a shoulder issue.

Sam Wright's year is also over due to the likely possibility of ankle surgery, while star forward Jarrad Waite will miss a fortnight with a calf injury.
