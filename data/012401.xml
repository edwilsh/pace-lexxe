One person is fighting for life after a flying-school plane crashed southeast of Melbourne, with another person trapped.
Ambulance Victoria says the aircraft crashed at Clyde North at about 10.40am on Thursday, with one person in a critical condition.
A man believed to be in his 30s is trapped in the plane with neck, chest and back injuries but is in a stable condition.
Two air ambulances have been dispatched.
The Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman said it was a "flying school plane" from Moorabbin.
Police and firefighters are also at the crash site.
