  <title>Usain Bolt's final race shocker</title>
  <content>
AMERICAN veteran Justin Gatlin was booed after he stunned Usain Bolt to win the 100m world title in London.
Gatlin, who served a doping ban between 2006-10 and won silvers behind Bolt at the last two world championships, clocked 9.92 seconds, with countryman Christian Coleman winning silver in 9.94 sec.
Bolt suffered a dreadful start and could only claim bronze in 9.95 seconds.
"I'm sorry I couldn't end it on a winning note, but I want to thank you for your support," said Bolt, who embraced Gatlin after they streaked through the line with no clear victor immediately apparent. It's been a wonderful experience as always."
Gatlin was afforded the same rough reception as he had in the heats and semi-finals, loud boos and jeering ringing around the same stadium where in 2012 his rivalry with Bolt was presented as "good against evil", given the American's doping-tainted past.
But Gatlin has form as the last man to beat Bolt over 100m - by a hundredth of a second in Rome in 2013 - and at the age of 35, can still produce the goods, something he has in the past ironically credited with his four years of forced exile from the track.
USAIN BOLTS INTO HISTORY
USAIN Bolt may have finished third in his final competitive 100m race, but he also carved out another slice of history.
His bronze medal, ironically his first ever at a major event, was his 14th medal at a World Championships. This tied him for most ever by a Jamaican athlete, joining Merlene Ottey.
Bolt still has the opportunity to claim the record on his own, when he compete in the 4 x 100m relay next week.

Usain Bolt did win his 14th World Championships medal (and 1st bronze), tying fellow Jamaican Merlene Ottey for the most by any athlete. ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡²
'THE CHEAT' CONDEMNDED
Justin Gatlin's shock win in the Men's 100m final silenced the London Stadium, but also social media.

Re-100m, Bolt was beaten, problem I have is by someone banned for drugs. I think if you're a drugs cheat you shouldnt be back in the sport
