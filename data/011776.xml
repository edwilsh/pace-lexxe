  <title>Paris hopes for a Swift rise to top</title>
  <content>
A BRUSH with fame has inspired a Bundoora teen to launch her musical career.
Cassidy Janevski, 14, is releasing her first single Talk About It under her stage name Cassidy Paris.
Inspiration struck when Miss Janevski was rocking out at a Taylor Swift concert in 2011.
"She picked me out of the crowd with a few others and I got to go back stage and we ate pizza together, she was so nice," she said.
Talk About It takes rock cues from Avril Lavigne and Swift and is available on iTunes.
It was co-written by Canadian singer Paul Laine, best known for his work with Dark Horse and the Defiants.
Music runs in the family for Miss Janevski.
Her father Steve is a guitarist for the power metal band Black Majesty and hard rock group The Radio Sun.
He said his daughter had leaned the ropes by joining him at concerts around the world.
Paris will embark on a Melbourne schools tour to promote the single as well as playing showcase shows in support of The Radio Sun in Japan in November.
