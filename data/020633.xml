  <title>Crane crashes onto Sydney building</title>
  <content>
POLICE have evacuated four unit blocks after a crane crashed onto a penthouse in Sydney's south this morning.
Three people were injured when the structure toppled from one building onto another at Brodie Sparks Drive, Wolli Creek. It is understood the crane was being set up when it fell backwards.
Two were taken to St George Hospital, one suffering from a leg injury.
Photos from the scene show the crane resting on the penthouse of the apartment complex which sustained substantial structural damage.
Four buildings are now at risk and have been evacuated as police establish an exclusion zone, with hundreds of people told to leave with fears the crane could fall.
Road closures are in place while no trains are running between Central and Turrella on the T2 Airport Line. Buses have been arranged to transport people between Sydenham and Central.

Customers travelling to city for Wolli Creek, Inter/Dom Airport, Mascot & Green Sq should change at Sydenham for replacement or local bus.
Wolli Creek resident Felicia Nguyen, who lives in the building opposite to where the crane came down, said they just had time to grab some personal items.
"They told us that when they rescue the crane it might fall into my building so we were evacuated us until the rescue team gets here and can start work but we don't know how long that will take,' she said.
Ms Nguyen said she was having breakfast when she heard the crane collapse just after 9.30am.
"We heard the crashing sound we went to the door and the white crane just fell down.
"They were setting it up and it seemed to fall into the penthouse of the building next door.

"It was really loud, it was like something had dropped from the top floor, all the glass fell from the top floor, from the penthouse, the windows fell out and about 5m of the balcony all fell to the road below and it's now blocking it off.
"I hope there was nobody in the penthouse, I couldn't see anyone.
"When the crashing sound happened I saw all these people all raced out the back door (of the building) because they couldn't go out the front and look up to see what happened, then they were told to evacuate.
"Other people were shopping and the came back and it was blocked off and they had to leave," she said.
Suzanne Badge lives in the neighbouring building facing the site and was forced to flee with her pet rabbit Winston.
"I just heard a massive crash and it was obvious something had gone terribly wrong," Ms Badge told The Daily Telegraph.
"I looked out and saw the wreckage, people were taking photos and constructions guys were screaming at each other."
"It was scary there was debris everywhere. The penthouse was smashed in two."
'The SES banged on the door and I grabbed my handbag, keys and the rabbit."
"I don't know when we'll be able to get back in."
Another neighbour, who took the video of the wreckage, said there had been "unsafe work practice" happening at the site for some time.
The woman, who did not want to be named, said they had noticed the crane swaying the night before.
"We were enjoying a coffee from our window when we saw it all happen," she said.
"It was terrifying."
"We could see people in the penthouse and believe there have been some people injured."
'There was debris everywhere and one of my neighbours had to run to dodge a brick that was falling."
SafeWork NSW has been advised and will investigate the incident.
It is expected the exclusion zone will remain in place for some time.
