A factory has caught fire in Melbourne, with the blaze threatening to spread to an adjoining building.
A smoke warning was issued for nearby homes after the factory in Nelson Street, Moorabbin, caught fire on Monday night, the Metropolitan Fire Brigade said.
The blaze was threatening to spread to another factory that shares a wall with the burning building and fire crews are expected to remain on scene for several hours.
