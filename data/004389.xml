The show has performed to millions around the world including to audiences on Broadway and London's West End, now Wicked: The Untold Story of the Witches of Oz is to delight theatre-goers in the Illawarra.
It will be The Arcadians Theatre Group's biggest production in three years and is to run at the Illawarra Performing Arts Centre from August 11 to 19.

Dylan Wright, 23, plays Prince Fiyero and said scoring a role on a production of Wicked has been on his bucket-list for years.
"It's one of those shows a lot of performers of today really connect with and love, it's a show for everyone," he said.

The musical is told from the perspective of the witches of the Land of Oz with the plot beginning before, and after Dorothy's arrival from Kansas.
Around 100 people have helped to put the production together, including a cast of about 50 - the youngest being 16-years-old and the eldest in their late 70s.
