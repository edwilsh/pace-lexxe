  <title>Magic moment sure to delight young readers</title>
  <content>
FRESHWATER sisters Grace and Alesha Hughes are the perfect reading buddies - and mum couldn't be more pleased.
Every afternoon Alesha, 9, will sit down with her younger sibling, 5, and pour through the pages of a different book.
"I've always encouraged them to read," their mother Rachael said.
"We're members of the library and will borrow books a few times every month.
"I still love reading and have a book beside my bed. We'll all go into the bookshops together and see what's available."
The Hughes sisters, who attend Freshwater Christian College, have become big fans of the Cairns Post's Great Australian Story Book Collection.
Today's title is The Magic Hat, a great story first published in 2002 by renowned children's author Mem Fox.
