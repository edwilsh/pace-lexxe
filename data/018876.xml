  <title>The numbers behind Priddis' demise</title>
  <content>
IT was the marriage made in heaven that didn't last the distance.
Rather than irreconcilable differences, it is the question of irreconcilable similarities that champion veterans Matt Priddis and Sam Mitchell have had to deal with since the beginning of their surprise union.
Fostered by mutual respect and admiration, the relationship bloomed as the midfield pair worked closely together during summer training.
There was a honeymoon period on-field as well, as both started the season strongly and West Coast began with two wins.
But when the losses came, they tended to be catastrophic and led to some pointed questions, both inside and outside the club, about the compatibility of the two ageing stars in the same midfield.
The Eagles might have escaped with a win in the round 17 western derby, but the midfield mauling they copped from Fremantle three weeks ago proved pivotal.
Priddis and Mitchell have not played in the same side since. With West Coast's finals hopes resting on a knife edge ahead of today's clash with St Kilda at Etihad Stadium, Priddis has found himself on the outer.
Of the eight main midfielders the Eagles have rotated through the centre square this season, Dom Sheed is the only one who has increased his presence in the middle and that was natural after he missed most of last season with injury.
Even then, Sheed has been used there only marginally more often this season, with his centre bounce attendances jumping from 38 per cent in the games he played last season to 42 per cent this year.
So Priddis hasn't really been pushed out of the midfield to give youngsters more opportunity.
Eagles adamant about opening stadium

The key difference between West Coast's midfield set-up in 2016 and 2017 is the addition of Mitchell, who has been used at 55 per cent of centre bounces in the 16 games he has played.
Priddis, Luke Shuey, Jack Redden, Elliot Yeo, Andrew Gaff and Mark Hutchings have all had their time in the centre square reduced.
While they all had fewer opportunities at centre bounces, Priddis loomed as the biggest loser because he was the most specialised stoppage player and the most limited in other areas.
With the Subiaco product not quick enough to have an impact when playing forward, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that the recruitment of Mitchell contributed to shortening Priddis' career.
Asked if his inclusion had affected Priddis, Mitchell looked at the cup as half-full after the champion pair made retirement announcements just five days apart.
"You'd have to ask him, but I don't think so. And if I did, I hope it was for the better. We worked really closely together in the pre-season and we learnt a lot from each other," Mitchell said.
"I've absolutely loved working with Pridda. From the first minute I walked in you could tell the influence that he'd had, particularly on the younger players, and just from a cultural point of view."
Since Mitchell's arrival, inside specialist Priddis has had his centre bounce opportunities cut from 79 per cent last season to 68 per cent this year and his time in the midfield has been slashed from 94 per cent to 80 per cent of his game time.
Priddis' time on the field has also dropped to 81 per cent, meaning he has sat on the bench for the equivalent of three full games.
'She's got as much lip on her as me'

At his retirement press conference, he blamed his inability to adapt to what he's been asked to do for the hurried end to his storied career and again insisted he and Mitchell could play together.
"There's a number of reasons, from list management to my form to my role going forward," Priddis said.
"For my role going forward, I probably put my own hand up and say I don't think I can play a good enough role for the team. And the team is always first.
"I've loved playing alongside Mitch. He's brought so much to the footy club. And I think there's a spot for both of us. That will be a week-to-week sort of decision. But it's been a great honour to be able to play alongside him this year."
Priddis' numbers are down this season, with his average of 24.3 disposals per match his lowest since 2008. The mature-age success story's contested possession and clearance numbers are also down from his peaks in 2014, his Brownlow year, and 2015, in which he was even better statistically.
Yet when his reduced ground time and midfield time are factored in, his performances stack up pretty well in terms of the raw numbers.
What definitely hasn't dropped off is Priddis' ability to tackle and pressure. His average pressure points score this season of 57.9 is higher than in his stellar 2014-15 peak.
Priddis, who will retire as the leading tackler in AFL history, remains his team's leading tackler and his average of 7.6 tackles per game is higher than his career average.
But while the 32-year-old is strong defensively in the contest, it is his lack of speed on the spread which has eventually told in the 12th season of his remarkable AFL journey.
The disastrous defeat to Collingwood a fortnight ago was the trigger for the emotional meeting between Priddis and coach Adam Simpson two days later which would lead to the end of the midfielder's career despite being contracted to play on.
While the loss and Priddis' below-par performance brought things to a head, the issue of his future had already been simmering as the Eagles chopped and changed their strategy with him.
West Coast's desire for more speed and different combinations around the ball pushed Priddis into spending time forward, but his lack of pace would get exposed when he had to sprint back towards goal with the flight of the ball.
Simpson concedes he should have been more upfront about Priddis' changing role, with public debate over his effectiveness being stoked by a drop in his numbers.
"We've played him in a little bit of a different role this year and if anything, I haven't explained that as well as I should have," Simpson said.
"Because we've been playing him forward and on-ball with mixed success. But it's given opportunity to some of our other players as well and he's been all-in on that from the very beginning."
Priddis' swift demise could never have been imagined when his contract extension for 2018 was announced during the club's mid-season break.
"Mentally I'm wanting to improve, I am always looking to get better, and I am really pleased to get the contract done at this time of the year," he said in June.
He was solid in the next game, an important home triumph over Geelong, but is believed to have been pushing for more midfield time so he could get back to doing what he did best. In the lead up to the round 14 home game against Melbourne his wish was granted.
Although his time on the bench was increasing, Priddis played exclusively in the midfield for the first time this season. He had 17 disposals and three clearances and the Eagles lost a thriller. The following week Priddis missed the trip to face the Western Bulldogs at Etihad Stadium with injury, which allowed for the recall of Redden, 26, whose improved form would soon be a factor in Priddis sliding down the pecking order.
The Eagles made do without Priddis and also defied the key absences of skipper Shannon Hurn and forward Josh Kennedy, as they knocked off the Bulldogs by seven points in one of their most impressive wins of the season.
Priddis was brought back the following week to face Port Adelaide at home and allowed to play his preferred midfield role. He had 19 disposals and five clearances as the Eagles were done on their home deck for the third time in four games.
He was more prominent in the derby, but the Eagles were beaten in the midfield, losing the clearances 40-28 against a Fremantle outfit powered by Nat Fyfe and Lachie Neale. West Coast got home by five goals, but knew they had been assisted by the Dockers' wastefulness in front of goal.
Priddis and Mitchell each had 26 touches in the derby, however it remains the last time they have been chosen in the same team. The following week Mitchell watched the infamous Collingwood debacle as a "coaching emergency", while Priddis was again asked to play out of his comfort zone.
Priddis had 16 touches, including just three kicks, and spent half of the game in the midfield. He played a quarter of it forward and spent another quarter of it on the bench.
If Elliot Yeo had kicked his running shot on goal entering time-on of the last term to put the Eagles 22 points in front, West Coast would have won and the turmoil that has engulfed Priddis and the club for the past fortnight might have been avoided. At least put on hold.
Yeo hit the post, Collingwood kicked four straight goals in time-on and the career of one of the club's most loved and respected figures was about to be brought to a premature end.
