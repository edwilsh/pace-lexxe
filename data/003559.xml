  <title>Turkish journalist pelted by hail during live weather report</title>
  <content>
A Turkish journalist has been battered by golf ball-sized hail on live television as wild weather devastated Istanbul.

"I can barely stand up. I feel the pain of the hail on my body," the female reporter yelled as chunks of ice smashed onto her head during a live cross for A News.

"I have difficulties in walking, it is totally dark."

An umbrella was eventually given to her by a colleague but buckled from the extreme winds as a studio anchor urged her to find shelter.

"If you can hear me... come inside. We only need to see the weather," the anchor said.

However, the reporter couldn't hear the request and continued her painful report.
