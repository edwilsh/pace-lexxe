  <title>Free healthcare for asylum seekers in Qld</title>
  <content>
The Queensland government has reintroduced a policy to provide free health care to asylum seekers who are ineligible for Medicare.
Health Minister Cameron Dick has reinstated a 2006 policy that was discontinued under the Newman government's hospital and health services reforms.
"Estimates put it at a few hundred people, so the costs of providing them with access to care are quite modest compared with the health, social and community benefits to be gained," Mr Dick said.
