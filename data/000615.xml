Voting closes at 10am Tuesday.

Battery Hill Veterinary Clinic

Dr Ernie Young opened Battery Hill Veterinary Clinic in October 2015, and has since become a trusted veterinarian

Nominator Michelle Cole said the practice was the only one she would entrust her "fur babies" with, and the vets "very professional, caring" and had "a special way with animals".

Other nominators said their pets loved Dr Young and nurse Annette Cochrane.

"After trialling many vets around the coast, Dr Ernie is by far the most professional, kind and experienced vet around with reasonable prices," Emily Hick said.

Nicklin Way Veterinary Surgery

This Warana vet practice is owned by local veterinarians Dr Doug Gray and Dr Melanie Irvine. Established in 1989, the practice has grown with a team of seven doctors and 10 nurses.

4 Paws Animal Rescue president Julie Penlington said she was grateful to the practice for their support to the charity.

"Nicklin Way (Veterinary Surgery) goes above and beyond... 4 Paws animal Rescue could not survive without them," she said.

Palmwoods Vet Veterinary Clinic

Principal vet Dr Brett Stone owns the practice with wife Tonya since 1998.

The practice makes contributions to local animal causes, with 10% of proceeds going to charity.

Nominator Emily Bull said Palmwoods was lucky to have the practice.

"Brett Stone at Palmwoods vet has been our family vet for close to 15 years," she said.

"He and his team have seen us through many devastating family losses and his compassion and care is second to none."

Bli Bli Vet

Vet Peter Beck has owned Bli Bli Vet since taking over the surgery in 1994, and works alongside three nurses at the clinic.

Jennifer Martin praised the staff as "very talented and dedicated to their career", while Amber Guest said they were "caring, compassionate and reliable".

Chancellor Park Veterinary Surgery

Dr Sebastian Olasek and Dr Annabel Shepherd are the practice owners and clinic veterinarians at Chancellor Park Veterinary Surgery, working with two other vets and six nurses.

The Natural Vets

The Natural Vets practice is a holistic pet health clinic at Forest Glen, with four veterinarians and five nurses.

Nominator Ben O'Duhring said the practice was the best on the Coast.

"We love how they seamlessly integrate traditional western medicine with alternative therapies," he said.

"Dr Henry has been practising on the Coast for nearly 40 years and has an incredible reputation for healing animals when other vets were simply managing symptoms."

Caloundra Vet Surgery

This small, family-owned clinic has been running since 1996 with Dr Colin Tedman as senior veterinarian and practice owner.

Jade Watts said the surgery offered "really good prices and such nice staff".

Blanck Street Veterinary Surgery

Practice owner Dr David Dawe purchased this Maroochydore clinic in 1994, with the small practice employing one further vet and three nurses.

Jennifer Forster said the vets at the clinic went above and beyond for the animals.

"They've saved both our precious kitties and Dave has even been known to sleep on the floor beside his patients," she said.

Beachside Vet

Dr Dan Capps leads the team at this locally-owned, family-operated Coolum clinic.

The practice offers after hours emergency service and a housecall service.

Marcoola Veterinary Surgery

Dr Brad Sultmann has owned this clinic since 1990, and has become a community favourite as the practice's sole veterinarian working alongside nurse Katrina Sultmann.
