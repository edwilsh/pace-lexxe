  <content>
A 72-year-old Adelaide man is dead after his car hit a tree in the city's northeast.
The man died at the scene and was the only occupant in the car.
Police say his death takes the state's road toll for 2017 to 55 compared to 47 at this time last year, but investigations will continue to determine if he suffered a medical episode before the crash.
