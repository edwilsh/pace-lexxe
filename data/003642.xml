  <title>Overhaul of Vic school grades 'confusing'</title>
  <content>
A new grading system for students is confusing families who think their children's grades are slipping, Victorian principals say.
A grades will be awarded only to students who are 18 months ahead of the expected level for their age, instead of 12 months, making it harder for students to achieve exceptional results.
Students who are six-to-12 months ahead will now receive a B rating and those working at the expected level will get a C.
Principals have been scrambling to explain the changes to parents and students, some of whom mistakenly thought their grades were slipping.
"It is about educating parents and students that the bar has been raised and therefore it's that little harder to get an A than it might have been at the end of last year," Victorian Principals Association president Anne-Maree Kliman told ABC radio on Tuesday.
Ms Kliman said she preferred an older system that graded students on the basis of how well they performed in each subject.
"When I got an A in a subject (it meant) I was in the top 80-100 per cent in that subject," she said.
