  <title>Appeal to find missing Victorian woman</title>
  <content>
A backpack belonging to a missing Victorian woman has been found on a Gold Coast beach.
Police are appealing for information about Gail Elizabeth Oliver after her bag was found by a member of the public on Kurrawa Beach at Broadbeach about 6.15am on Monday.
A search of the beach and water failed to locate the 40-year-old, who was reported missing in her home state.
Officers have since been told a woman matching Ms Oliver's description was seen walking from the area on Sunday night.
Concerns are held for her welfare and anyone with information is urged to contact police.
