  <title>'Monster' UFC debutant's savage KO</title>
  <content>
WHAT a way to introduce yourself to the UFC.
Peruvian fighter Humberto Bandenay took his fight on two weeks notice, but certainly showed no sign of that.
He needed just 26 seconds to finish it, providing a sensational knockout of featherweight Martin Bravo at UFC Fight Night Mexico City.
Bandenay provided the highlight of the card, his headkick ensuring an emphatic victory. The win was a huge result, given Bandenay was a heavy underdog going into the fight with Bravo.
What made the win even more impressive was the fact that Bandenay lost his father recently. The Peru fighter dedicated his performance in Mexico to his mentor and also created a piece of history in picking up his win.
Bandenay's defeat of Bravo was the third fastest debut win in featherweight history.
The savage knockout caught the attention of plenty on twitter, and the Peruvian has found himself plenty of new fans.

Yeezus. Bandenay just slept Bravo with a nasty head kick. Huge win for the Peruvian.
Also on the main card, UFC legend Rashad Evans may have seen the end of his career.
The former UFC champion lost to Sam Alvey by split decision in a fight that lacked any real fireworks.
The two fighters struggled to break each other down and as a result the action was cagey throughout the three-round affair.
Opinions were mixed post-fight, but while fans couldn't agree on a decision, they certainly agreed that the performance was uninspiring from Evans. The fighter would have been looking to make a statement, given he has been hampered by injury in recent years.

Rashad didn't do anything he needed to do in that fight to win but neither did Alvey. I'm let down. ðŸ˜•
