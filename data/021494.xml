The Russian Su-25 Groch, or "Rook" in Russian, and US A-10 Thunderbolt II, or "Warthog," are similar in many ways.

They're both heavily armoured. They're both able to execute extremely low-altitude sorties and bombing raids. And they have both even been described as "flying tanks."

Production on the Su-25, which the US calls the "Frogfoot," and the A-10 Warthog both began in the 1970s, and they have since been used quite extensively.

Check out how the two aircraft match up below:

The Su-25s rockets range from 'pods containing dozens of smaller 57- or 80-millimetre rockets, to five-shot 130-millimetre S-13 system, to large singular 240- or 330-millimetre rockets,' the National Interest .

It first saw combat in 1981 in Afghanistan, the National Interest , where it flew more than 60,000 bombing raids and sorties. Su-25s were also  by Russia and Georgia during the 2008 Russo-Georgian War.

The A-10 has likewise seen combat in nearly every US conflict since the aircraft's inception.

Four of the Su-25s newest version, the Su-25SM3, which features a SOLT-25 targeting system that allows pilots to better see targets at night and during bad weather, are expected to arrive in Syria in August or September,  to Southfront.org.

It's also fitted with new precision-guided weapons, such as the RBC SPBE 500-D, which is a 500 kilogram cluster bomb with an infrared-guided, anti-tank bomb that can penetrate 150mm to 160mm steel armour,  to the National Interest.
