  <title>Bouncers bashed with bollards in Bendigo</title>
  <content>
A teenager has serious head injuries after he and two bouncers were bashed with metal bollards outside a nightclub in the regional Victorian town of Bendigo.
Two men who were thrown out of the club at 1am on Sunday used crowd control bollards to attack the bouncers and the 19-year-old man who was hit in the face and knocked unconscious, police say.
The teen was taken to hospital with serious head injuries and police are looking for the two men who they believe were part of a larger group at the club.
