Octomedia and a group of sophisticated investors registered a new company called Career Media Group on July 31 for the purchase.
Career Media Group is 33 per cent owned by Octomedia while four individuals own 16.7 per cent each. The individual investors include Octomedia's chairman, and Catch of the Day chief executive, Nati Harpaz, and Melbourne barrister Philip Crutchfield QC. 
Octomedia's chief executive, Oliver Ranck, said the purchase was the "perfect marriage" for its business, which publishes industry titles such as Inside Retail, Inside FMCG (fast moving consumer goods), Inside Small Business, and a magazine for charities and not-for-profits called Third Sector. 
"One of the key issues for businesses is to find those candidates who are not actively looking for jobs," Mr Ranck said. 

"We have the ability to integrate job positions with content and this will make it a more personalised experience." 
CareerOne receives about 5 million hits per month, he added. 
with Barry Wight of Cor Cordis on May 12, 2017. At the time it owned 90 per cent of the shares in CareerOne. 
CareerOne was launched in 1999 by News Corp, which then turned it into a joint venture with job search site Monster Worldwide. Acquire Learning bought a 65 per cent stake in June 2015 for $20 million. It then increased this to 90 per cent, with the remaining 10 per cent still held by Monster. 
About 17 people are still employed by CareerOne. Along with chief executive Ben Foote they will stay in their jobs and now work with Octomedia.
