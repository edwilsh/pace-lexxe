KINDNESS is the number one quality for those looking to moonlight as St Nick this Christmas.
Agents are already advertising for Santas to sit in shopping centres.
Straight Down the Line Promotions' Rosalind Palisi said she already had four applicants in the Far North. She puts them through training and said successful Santas must have a Blue Card, love kids, present well and be trustworthy and reliable.
This December will be Atherton man Mil Clay's third as Santa.
"I kept coming back because it's good fun," the 71-year-old grandfather-of-two said.
"Some kids walk in the shop and see Father Christmas and hide behind mum's skirts. Other kids see you and run up and hug you around the knees.
"You just have to be nice really and you've got to know all the names of the reindeer. And, it pays quite well."
He said coming up with diplomatic and inventive responses to questions and remembering how to hold a newborn were two of the more difficult aspects of the job.
