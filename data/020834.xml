  <title>Qld cabinet considers tow-truck shake up</title>
  <content>
Queensland's state cabinet will consider a proposal to cap vehicle towing fees at $250 to crack down on dodgy practices in the industry.
Acting Main Roads Minister Steven Miles will present the recommendations of an investigation into the tow truck industry to the weekly state cabinet meeting on Monday.
In addition to capping towing fees, the investigation, headed by former District Court Judge Michael Forde, recommended new licences for drivers and increased penalties for those caught breaking the rules.
The investigation was launched in May after a newspaper report revealed operators charging up to $1000 for people to recover their cars from impound lots, as well as engaging in predatory behaviour to trick people into getting towed.
