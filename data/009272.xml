  <title>IS THIS HOW WE GET GAY MARRIAGE? WITH BROKEN VOWS?</title>
  <content>
I ask the gay Liberal MPs about to break a promise: is this really how you want to achieve same-sex marriage? With a trick? By hoaxing voters? By confirming suspicions that gay activists are bullies who will trample on anyone to get their way?
See, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull went to the last election with a clear promise - to let Australians decide in a public vote whether to allow same-sex marriage.
Voters would decide, not our politicians.
Poll after poll shows this is indeed a decision voters want to make themselves.
It's simply too important an issue to leave to fame-seeking politicians.
But now four gay Liberal MPs - Trent Zimmerman, Dean Smith, Trevor Evans and Tim Wilson - have signalled they will break Turnbull's promise and as early as next week.
