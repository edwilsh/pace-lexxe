  <title>Betty Cuthbert dead at 79</title>
  <content>
AUSTRALIAN track and field legend Betty Cuthbert has died aged 79 after a long battle with multiple sclerosis.
As an 18-year-old, Cuthbert was one of the stars of the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, winning three gold medals in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay.
She set an Olympic record of 11.4 seconds in the 100m and ran the anchor leg as Australia broke the world record in the relay.
After injury prevented her from adding to her tally in Rome four years later she added the 400m crown in Tokyo in 1964.
She is still the only Olympian - male or female - to have won gold in the 100m, 200m and 400m and only Ian Thorpe (five) has won more gold for Australia.

RIP Betty Cuthbert • a pioneer for Aussie female sprinters, a legend of the sport ❤️ my thoughts are with your family & friends at this time

RIP Betty cuthbert, an absolute icon of Australian sport 🇦🇺🏃‍♀️
