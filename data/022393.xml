  <title>Wave likely caused WA men's death: inquest</title>
  <content>
Two experienced fisherman who were never heard from again after going missing off the WA coast were probably hit by a large wave that sank their boat, an inquest has heard.
The coroner is investigating the deaths of Rockingham men Nigel Kitchen, 50, and 57-year-old Andrew Hinds, who failed to return from a fishing trip off Coral Bay last year.
The key evidence of the men's fate was the discovery by a diver two days after they were last heard from of a human arm that was confirmed to be Mr Kitchen's and had been bitten off by sharks.
