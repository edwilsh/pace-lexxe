A state funeral will be held for SBS football legend Les Murray, the NSW government has announced.

Murray, dubbed 'Mr Football', died after a long period of illness on Monday.

"On behalf of the people of NSW I extend my deepest sympathies to Les Murray's family, friends and colleagues," NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.

"Thanks in large part to Les's tireless and passionate advocacy, football is now one of the most popular sports in the country and part of our mainstream sporting consciousness."

There had been calls for a state funeral from Murray's former colleagues and the federal Labor party.
