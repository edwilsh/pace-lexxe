  <title>Murals showcase Melbourne sporting sites</title>
  <content>
CROYDON Primary School students are kicking goals at two famous Melbourne sporting stadiums thanks to impressive new murals.
Architecture student Zac Bunston, 19, spray-painted the MCG and AAMI Park on the school's rebound walls for the students to use at recess.
"I'd only just painted the goals on the AAMI Park wall and in the next hour there were already kids bringing soccer balls to play," Bunston said.
Bunston has also painted murals at cafes and offices but he enjoys the reaction of students when he paints at schools.
"It's special doing it for a school because the kids really enjoy the interactive part of it," Bunston said.
"It's great doing this for the kids and it's very rewarding. They think it's awesome."
