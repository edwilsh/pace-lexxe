  <title>Green Machine needs to go up a gear: Papalii</title>
  <content>
Queensland star Josh Papalii says the Canberra Raiders will need to go to another level against reigning premiers Cronulla.
Papalii feels the standout performance of Joe Tapine in the win over South Sydney will help drive that lift ahead of the must-win clash at Shark Park on Saturday night.

Canberra keep slim finals hopes alive

The Raiders claimed a solid 32-18 victory over South Sydney.

The 25-year-old was desperate to return to Canberra's second row after a two-game suspension, with winger Jordan Rapana also coming back from a ban.
Having comfortably accounted for Souths 32-18 on the weekend, Papalii felt the Green Machine would need to click into another gear against the Sharks.

The Raiders need to win their five remaining games to make the NRL finals, with third-placed Cronulla boasting a pack including Paul Gallen, Andrew Fifita, Wade Graham and Luke Lewis.
Papalii said the Raiders had a finals mentality going into the run home.

"I think there is. I think everyone needs to go up a notch as well," he said.
"We definitely know how to get there, we definitely know how to play finals it's just controlling the ball a bit more and not being as desperate as we were the last couple of weeks."

Tapine was brilliant on what's usually Papalii's left edge, scoring a try and helping set up one on his way to 166 run metres with one line break.
Canberra coach Ricky Stuart has named him to return to the bench, where he'll play through the middle as a lock or prop.
Winger Michael Oldfield also scored a try filling in for Rapana and Papalii said that pressure for positions would help lift the Green Machine as they fight to keep their season alive.
"Yeah it does. The younger players are pushing the older fellas a bit more, it keeps us on our toes a bit," Papalii said.
"Seeing Joe come through in that South Sydney game gives [Stuart] more options as well."
Raiders hooker Josh Hodgson was unsure how he'll be used against the Sharks, having started as a ball-playing lock in recent weeks instead of his usual role at dummy half.
He joked maybe he'd spent too much time in the gym.
It's meant Kurt Baptiste has started at No.9 and allowed Stuart to pack his bench with big boppers like Dave Taylor.
"Maybe I'm doing too many weight, [Stuart] thinks I'm a front-rower," Hodgson laughed.
"It's just what's best for the team at the moment, we had Papa out and we had Sia [Soliola] out.
"By having me at lock and Kurt [Baptiste] starting at nine that gives us the luxury of having four middles on the bench and a bit of impact coming off there.
"I'm not sure what's going to go on this week with Papa being back, we'll just have to wait and see."
Hodgson was expecting a "fiery" encounter against the Sharks, who they played in last year's qualifying final.
Interestingly, the away team has won the last eight encounters between Canberra and Cronulla, with Hodgson hoping that streak would extend to nine.
Another factor in the Raiders' favour is comparatively the Sharks have struggled at home this season, winning just five of their 10 games at Shark Park.
"It's always a great game against the Sharks. We always have a fiery encounter, it's usually good to watch and it's a tough place to go down and get a win," Hodgson said.
"We're expecting a good game and we're pretty sure we can go down there and do a job.
"They've got a great pack and they've got some fast outside backs. We know it's going to be a physical battle in the middle and we know we've got to win that first before anything else."
