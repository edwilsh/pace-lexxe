  <title>AL GORE GASSES ON AT HOME</title>
  <content>
Global warming alarmist Al Gore demands we cut emissions to save the planet.    
The hypocrite then goes home and really fires up.

On Friday, Al Gore's sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth" - "An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power" - arrives in movie theaters across the country. But ... Gore's hypocritical home energy use and "do as I say not as I do" lifestyle has plunged to embarrassing new depths.
In just this past year, Gore burned through enough energy to power the typical American household for more than 21 years, according to a  by the National Center for Public Policy Research. The former vice president consumed 230,889 kilowatt hours (kWh) at his Nashville residence, which includes his home, pool and driveway entry gate electricity meters. A typical family uses an average of 10,812 kWh of electricity per year, according to the .
It gets worse.
Last September alone, Gore devoured 30,993 kWh of electricity. That's enough to power 34 average American homes for a month. Over the last 12 months, Gore used more electricity just heating his outdoor swimming pool than six typical homes use in a year.
And that's for just one of his three homes.
