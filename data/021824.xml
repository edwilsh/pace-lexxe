  <title>Japan star fulfilling promise with big victory</title>
  <content>
GOLF: Hideki Matsuyama has shown why is favourite to become the first Japanese man to win a major trophy after shooting a 61 in the final round to win the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational.
Matsuyama fired seven birdies to equal the course record held by Tiger Woods, Sergio Garcia and Jose Maria Olazabal to win the event by five shots from Americans Zach Johnson (68) and Charley Hoffman (66)
The 25-year-old finished at 16-under 264 and will be one of the favourites to take out the final major of the year - the PGA Championship which begins at Quail Hollow this Friday.
"I played with Tiger four years ago when he shot 61 so I knew 61 was the number today," the world number three said.
"I knew if I birdied 16, 17 and 18 I could get there.
"You wouldn't have believed how I warmed up this morning.
"I was not hitting it good on the range. I did hit some good shots (during the round) but I was nervous all the way around because I really wasn't sure of my swing today."
It was Matsuyama's second World Golf Championships victory, after the HSBC Champions in Shanghai last year.
