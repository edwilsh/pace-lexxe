A MOBILE phone left charging was believed to be the cause of a house fire at Ascot Park, prompting warnings from authorities.
A neighbour's quick action to call triple-zero after spotting smoke coming from a duplex home on Albert St about 11am on Wednesday saved the house from being destroyed.
Eight firefighters arrived to find the fire, but quickly contained it to the bedroom, extinguishing it in 10 minutes.
The damage was limited to the bedroom and smoke staining throughout the home, with a total cost estimated at $30,000.
No one was home at the time but the occupants returned shortly after.
The Metropolitan Fire Service believed a mobile phone left charging on a bed may have ignited the mattress.
They reminded the public to never leave mobile phones, tablets or electronic devices charging in beds or on flammable furniture - including sofas.
"Always place items for charging on a well ventilated, nonflammable surface that is clear of combustibles," a MFS spokeswoman said.
