A Sydney school has been damaged by fire in what police say is suspicious circumstances.
Emergency services extinguished the blaze after being called to the school on Winbourne Street at West Ryde just after 1am on Thursday, but it caused significant damage to a building.
A crime scene has been established and forensic crews will examine the site later on Thursday, while police are appealing for witnesses to come forward.
