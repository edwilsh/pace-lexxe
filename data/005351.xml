  <title>Dockside smoke alert sparks traffic snarl</title>
  <content>
PEAK hour traffic on the Hobart waterfront was brought to a standstill after a fire incident in a dockside office building.
The Tasmania Fire Service was called to the incident on the Franklin Wharf side of Morrison St just before 4.30pm and blocked off a section of the road.
Fire crews searched for the source of smoke inside the building, which houses Tasmanian Greens leader Cassy O'Connor's office.
Two fire crews from Hobart and a crew from Glenorchy attended.
The incident was contained by 5.40pm.
