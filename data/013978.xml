  <title>Blackout causes traffic chaos in north Adelaide</title>
  <content>
Adelaide was hit by yet another blackout this morning, causing traffic chaos.

From around 5am until 7am half of O'Connell Street in north Adelaide went dark.

Drivers heading into the city faced a dangerous challenge navigating busy intersections with no traffic lights operational.

James Kent, a manager at Bakery O'Connell, said the business had to give away about $2000 in food due to equipment not working.

He said the popular 24-hour bakery is now trying to catch up with the morning rush.
"It's frustrating," he said, adding he wants answers from the government as to the cause of the outage, which is not yet known.
