  <title>BioScience appoints investment consultant</title>
  <content>
Healthcare investment specialist BioScience Managers has appointed Elizabeth Klein as an investment consultant, to support its collaboration with London-based investment firm Downing LLP.
Her primary focus will be on sourcing and reviewing investment opportunities for BioScience Managers' and the Downing FOUR Healthcare Share Class Venture Capital Trust (VCT) plc.
Downing FOUR Healthcare is targeting GBP10 million for its allocation and anticipates investing between GBP0.5 million to GBP1 million per company, alone or as part of a syndicate. The focus is on organisations with clear technological and market advantages and near to mid-term commercialisation potential, across a wide spectrum of areas including therapeutics, medical devices, diagnostics and digital health.
Ms Klein established her own consultancy, Klein-Edmonds Associates, in 2015 through which, alongside her role for BioScience Managers, she also provides consultancy to the UK BioIndustry Association and Radnor Capital Partners, amongst others.
