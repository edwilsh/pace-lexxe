THERE is nothing quite like the "electricity" in the air in the tense moments before the curtain lifts, the music starts and the lights go on.

And for the 130 students involved in the production of this year's ASPIRE, that buzz is sure to make the past six months of preparing, practicing and perfecting the musical spectacular all worth it.

"It's such a rush," Isabella Rendina, of St Francis Xavier's College, said.

"Some people go skydiving, bungee jumping, but being on that stage... there is an electricity in the air."
Actors, dancers, vocalists and musicians from 29 primary and secondary schools in the Diocese of Maitland-Newcastle will perform in Anna Kerrigan's production of The Hoarders Next Door at Civic Theatre from August 2 to August 5.

Students have been involved in every aspect of the production, from the backstage crew and set design, to the music, singing, acting and dancing.
Some tickets are still available via Ticketek.
"It's a really professional experience," Year 11 student Tom Rodgers, also of St Francis Xavier's College, said. 

"It has also been great getting to know students from other Catholic schools. It has been really inclusive, I've felt very welcomed, and inspired as well."
Year 10 student Zoe Walker, of St Pius X high school at Adamstown, said she hoped audiences would take away a sense of community and belonging from the performance.
