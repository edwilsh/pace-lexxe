  <title>Priscilla Presley on tour to discuss life with Elvis</title>
  <content>
PRISCILLA Presley will discuss her famous husband during an Australian speaking tour in November.
Presley's Elvis and Me show is billed as an "intimate interview format" where she will answer questions posed by host Richard Wilkins.
August 16 this year marks the 40th anniversary of Presley's death, aged just 42.
Elvis and Priscilla were married for six years and had daughter Lisa Marie Presley before divorcing in 1973.
The show promises "open conversation offering audiences an extremely rare opportunity to gain insight into a world only a few have entered" and that Presley will "answer questions and share stories that will spark curiosity and intriguing dialogue".
Presley manages the incredibly lucrative Elvis estate, and turned their home Graceland into a tourist attraction. Presley's estate continues to make millions through posthumous tours (where live bands play along to his voice via video screens) and new albums finding different ways to reinvent his back catalogue.
Elvis and Me takes place at The Star Gold Coast on November 4, Crown Theatre Perth on November 6, Crown Palladium Melbourne on November 9 and The Star Event Centre in Sydney on November 12.
Tickets go on sale on August 4 and are priced at between $110 and $230, with some venues having a VIP dinner option for $400.
