  <title>Osprey raises $22.2m</title>
  <content>
Osprey Medical has received commitments from investors to raise $22.2 million at $0.40 per CDI.
The placement was over-subscribed. Osprey is also undertaking a fully underwritten, non-renounceable entitlement offer at the same price to raise $10.3 million.
The funds raised from the placement and entitlement offer will be primarily used for expanding US sales force to increase coverage of the US with focus on geographies with a high share of AKI.
