  <title>Tina Daley recounts the last time she saw Lynette alive</title>
  <content>
THE last time Lynette Daley's sister saw her before she died she stumbled out of a four-wheel drive while Adrian Attwater and Paul Maris waited inside the vehicle, a NSW jury has heard.

Ms Daley smelled of alcohol and seemed drunk, her younger sister Tina Daley told the Supreme Court in Coffs Harbour today.

It was about 5am on Australia Day 2011, a day before the prosecution claims Ms Daley, 33, bled to death at Ten Mile Beach after she was sexually assaulted by Attwater and Maris.

"She asked me if I wanted to go camping with her," Tina Daley told the jury. "I said I'll get a babysitter for my daughter.

"She said she'll be back in the afternoon to pick me up."

Prosecutor Philip Strickland asked if Ms Daley ever came back.

No," her sister said.

Attwater, 42, has pleaded not guilty to the manslaughter and aggravated sexual assault of Ms Daley.

Maris has pleaded not guilty to aggravated sexual assault and hindering the discovery of evidence.

CCTV footage played in court showed Attwater and Maris appearing to buy alcohol in Iluka later in the morning of January 26.

The trio was later spotted driving up and down the remote Ten Mile Beach by several witnesses.

In a statement read out in court, Hayley Keller said she saw the white troop carrier drive past about 1pm with three people in the front seat.

"I remember saying ... 'they look pretty rough,'" her statement said.

Witness Gary Loy, who briefly spoke to the trio, said "they looked fairly rough and ill-dressed," in his statement.

The court earlier heard Attwater made a "last-minute, desperate, panicked call to triple-0" about 6am on January 27 after Ms Daley stopped breathing.

Attwater told police they had been swimming naked in the ocean when she had a seizure, Mr Strickland said.

The crown rejects Attwater's version of events, alleging Ms Daley would have been "either dead or dying" from genital injuries before being "dragged" into the water.

The trial continues.
