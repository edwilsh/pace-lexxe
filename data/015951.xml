  <title>Vic Police recall $1.6m faulty holsters</title>
  <content>
Victoria Police has spent $1.6 million on thousands of faulty gun holsters, and now hundreds of officers will have to reshuffle frontline shifts until the recall is complete.
The 18,000 new holsters were meant to solve issues with previous equipment, but late last week flaws were detected with the new gear during training and a safety alert was issued to officers.
Victoria Police say the roll back will not affect operations, and replacing problematic holsters and retraining the 350 officers will be completed by August 13.
