  <title>Man Utd fined for anti-doping breach</title>
  <content>
MANCHESTER United player Phil Jones has been banned for two European matches for verbally abusing a UEFA anti-doping officer.
Both Jones and teammate Daley Blind have also been fined £4,500 ($5,900).
Jones was understood to have been verbally abusive towards a doping control officer after he was requested to attend drug-testing after the final against Ajax in Stockholm on May 24.
He will now miss the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid next week and United's first Champions League group stage match in September.
It is understood Blind was reluctant to take a test as requested because he wanted to celebrate with his team-mates, whose 2-0 victory over Ajax ensured their qualification for this season's Champions League.
There is no suggestion that either player is guilty of doping.
Manchester United have also been fined £8,900 because of the rule breaches.
The club have three days to appeal against the decisions.
