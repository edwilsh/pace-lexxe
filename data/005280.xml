  <content>
A 28-YEAR-OLD man remains in hospital fighting for life more than a week after he was allegedly attacked outside a pub in Perth's north.
Police were called to the Northshore Tavern in Hillarys in the early hours of Saturday, July 22 after reports of a fight outside the venue.
"When they arrived, they found a man who had been severely injured during a physical altercation," a police spokesperson said.
That man, a 28-year-old from Tapping, remains in Royal Perth Hospital with severe head injuries.
On Monday, police charged a 33-year-old Balcatta man over the alleged assault.
The man was released on bail to appear in court on August 9.
Detectives are appealing for anyone who saw the fight to come forward.
Anyone in the area around 12.15am on July 22 or with information should contact Crime Stoppers.
