  <title>Wedge-tailed eagle goes through rehab after being shot</title>
  <content>
A wedge-tailed eagle, shot out of the sky on the outskirts of Gympie in south-east Queensland, will have to learn to fly again after life-saving surgery in Brisbane.

The eagle's injuries were so severe that the Brisbane Bird Vet, where Sir Wedginald was initially taken, did not have the equipment nor the experience to deal with them.

Associate Professor Bob Doneley, a bird medicine expert who performed the surgery on the bird, said shot wedge-tailed eagles usually died.
"This one was fortunate because the bullet went through a bone but left the vein beside it untouched," he said.

Because the bullet had struck the bone, Associate Professor Doneley said it may be necessary for Sir Wedginald to to undergo a bone graft to fly again.

"What we have done so far is to put some metal pins in his wing to stabilise the fracture and hold it still so it can heal," he said.
"We are going to wait and see how that goes before we make a decision."
Associate Professor Doneley said Sir Wedginald would spend the next two months at the hospital.
"Once we are satisfied that there's no vet care required, then the next stage is rehabilitation - getting the bird fit enough so he can be released," he said.
"That can take a long time, from six to eight months."
Associate Professor Doneley said Sir Wedginald would need to be taught how to fly with his repaired wing during that period.
Gympie Police did not have any reports on record and the Brisbane Bird Vet would not reveal who delivered Sir Wedginald to the clinic.
The wedge-tailed eagles protected status made it unlawful to kill or injure unless authorised.
They were driven close to extinction in the 20th century by farmers who regarded them as pests for targeting their lambs.
That attitude has largely disappeared and the bird's populations have reached a stable level on mainland Australia.
