  <title>No more room for excuses on sexual assault at universities</title>
  <content>
Too late, Australian universities are facing up to the shocking fact that their campuses are often not the safe and welcoming spaces they present to prospective international students in the glossy marketing brochures.
Too late, they are taking steps to address the sickening reality that in any lecture theatre of 100 students, at least one, and possibly two of them are likely to have been sexually assaulted in the past two years on campus, and more than one in five have been sexually harassed at university in the past year.Photo: Karleen Minney
Too late, because thousands of young lives have already been blighted by this preventable scourge.
Until now, universities might have pleaded ignorance to explain away their lack of action. That excuse disappears with the just-released report of the Human Rights Commission into sexual assault on campus based on a survey of 31,000 students. In a sign of the scale of the problem and the extent of concern about it, the commission received more submissions than to any other inquiry in its history, including more than 1800 accounts from students of their experience of sexual assault and harassment.
For years the Herald has been reporting on demeaning, sexist, brutalising behaviour at university residential colleges, particularly at Australia's oldest tertiary institution, the University of Sydney. For years, nothing was done, always with the excuse that the colleges are a law unto themselves, governed by their own councils, usually heavily dominated by alumni.
So we were cautiously optimistic in welcoming the appointment of former sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick to lead a university-wide review into college culture. We also thought it about time when St Paul's College, which had declined to join the review, belatedly sought to join after yet another degrading scandal involving misogynist behaviour.

The commission's recommendation of a sector-wide, independent investigation into residential colleges may encounter resistance but the time for excuses is over. The stories in the HRC report are all too familiar. Young women being raped in college after binge-drinking sessions. Repeat offenders - serial rapists, in fact - left unchallenged to assault again. Inadequate, inappropriate, even inhumane responses from university management to the minority who actually reported their assaults - 87 per cent don't, according to the survey.
Universities Australia, the peak industry body, deserves some credit for commissioning the report. It has promised "strong and swift" action in response. That includes working with the colleges, more '"first responder" training for university staff, specialist training for university counsellors and education for students about sexual consent, and new guidelines for postgraduate-staff interaction after the survey found postgraduate students were more likely to be harassed or assaulted by a staff member than other students. Individual universities have promised to release data on sexual assaults, which may add a competitive incentive for them to stamp out unacceptable behaviours.

The great challenge lies in changing the culture across campuses and in colleges where unacceptable sexual behaviour has been tolerated as part of university life, to be preferably ignored or if necessary covered up. Survivor advocacy groups have reasonably objected that the universities' official response is silent about punishment and sanctions for perpetrators. The universities may argue that's up to the police and the courts. But when less than 20 per cent of sexual assault cases lead to criminal proceedings in NSW and Victoria - and there have been only six expulsions from 145 reports of rape at universities in the past five years - a muscular response to offenders is needed along with support for survivors.
