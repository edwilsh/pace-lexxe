  <title>Melbourne's freezing start to August</title>
  <content>
MELBURNIANS are finding it a little difficult to get out of bed this morning, with temperatures of zero in some suburbs.
The mercury dipped to 0C at Avalon and Coldstream, and it was only a little warmer in the city where temperatures fell to 3.9C.
Morning fog is covering some parts of the eastern suburbs, but it won't hang around for long as the warm sun peaks through.
Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Dean Stewart said Melbourne will be mostly sunny with a top of 15C.
Light winds are expected.
"Some fog may redevelop tonight over Melbourne," he said.
July was a drier than average month and it is expected to continue into August.
"There is an increased chance of below average rainfall across the state for August," Mr Stewart said.
"It will likely be drier than normal for next few months across Victoria.
"Maximum and minimum temperate may be slightly above average."
