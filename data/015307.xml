FILM
IN THIS CORNER OF THE WORLD ★★ 1/2
Melbourne International Film Festival
Hoyts Melbourne Central, August 8, 6.30pm and August 19, 4pm

It sometimes feels as if the entire universe of Japanese animation has its creative origins in the horror of atomic destruction. This period piece from animator Sunao Katabuchi​ tackles the topic almost but not quite head-on, centring on an ordinary family living not far from Hiroshima in the later years of the Second World War.Photo: Asha Holmes Publicity
Even as things worsen for the characters, the realities of their day-to-day existence are shown in a deliberately homely, even whimsical light - as in a scene that goes into detail about how to cook a satisfying meal when supplies are low.
There are moments of tragedy, and points when the film breaks away from its generally muted, naturalistic style, drawing inspiration from the fact that the young heroine (voiced by Rena Nonen​) is a budding artist. But much of this is slow going, as if Katabuchi were consciously resisting the more intense possibilities of the theme.
