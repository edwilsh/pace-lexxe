HARDWARE giant Bunnings wants to build a distribution centre in Glynde after its plans for a $26 million store at the same site were knocked back.

The company last month lodged an application with Norwood Payneham & St Peters Council for the centre on the corner of Penna Ave and Glynburn Rd.

Bunnings property general manager Andrew Marks did not say how much the development would cost.

Bulk materials would be brought to the distribution centre, repackaged and then transported to other shops for sale.

It would not include a retail outlet.

In May, the DAP rejected Bunnings' application for a retail store, saying it would generate heavy traffic in surrounding streets.

About 1000 small-business owners and residents signed a petition last year opposing the original plan because of traffic concerns.

The council could not say when the new application would be assessed.
