  <title>Ipswich club's carnival offers special opportunity for schools</title>
  <content>
CLAREMONT Special School retained their champion status at the latest Ipswich City Football Club hosted Special Schools Carnival.
After winning the inaugural carnival in 2016, Claremont beat Ipswich West State School 4-1 in Tuesday's grand final at Sutton Park.
Goodna Special School finished third after Ipswich Special School withdrew due to a school camp.
Carnival co-ordinator Aaron Scott said the event would be run again next year.
"Ipswich City Football Club are honoured to host the event,'' Scott said.
"The aim is to see students having a great time, making friends and being competitive at the same time.
"The matches were played with a great deal of sportsmanship. A great deal of skill was on display as well.''
Scott said seeing the special students enjoying football was "very rewarding''.
Cr David Morrison opened the carnival at Brassall.
Ipswich City Bulls committee members ran the mini tournament.
Trophies were supplied by Colleges Engraving and Len Arnold at the Trophy Shop.
