  <title>Sydney girl escapes would-be kidnapper</title>
  <content>
A nine-year-old girl has fought off a kidnapper who attempted to snatch her from a netball court in Sydney's south in broad daylight.
The girl was in Wandella Road at Miranda with her family at 9am on Saturday when approached by an unknown man who picked her up and began carrying her away.
She yelled out and broke free before telling her father who alerted police.
Officers conducted a patrol but could not locate the man, who is described as Caucasian, about 180cm tall and of solid build. He was wearing a black jumper and blue jeans.
With the area crowded with people at the time of the attack, police are appealing for information.
