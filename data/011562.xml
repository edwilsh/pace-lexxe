  <content>
Police have confirmed the human bones found in a car dragged up from a dam west of Noosa in April are those of missing Tasmanian man Stuart Gatehouse.
The 58-year-old had been reported missing from Kenilworth in 2004 and, in April this year, a member of the public using a depth sounder discovered a car in the Borumba Dam and notified police.Photo: Seven News Brisbane
The police dive squad found the submerged red 1986 Holden Commodore in which he was last seen and, when it was dragged from the dam, police discovered human bones inside.
Police said preliminary results on the bones indicated his death was non-suspicious.Photo: Supplied
A report will be prepared for the coroner.
