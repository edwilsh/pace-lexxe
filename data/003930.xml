  <title>Casey Affleck's wife files for divorce</title>
  <content>
CASEY Affleck's wife has filed for divorce from the Oscar winning actor.
The couple were married for nine years before they announced their separation last year.
"Casey Affleck and Summer Phoenix have amicably separated," Affleck's rep told People in 2016, "They remain very close friends".
According to divorce papers filed by Summer Phoenix yesterday, the couple actually separated in November 2015 due to irreconcilable differences.
The couple have two sons together: Indiana, 13, and Atticus, 9, and Phoenix has requested joint physical and legal custody of the children according to .
Affleck met Summer Phoenix back in the 1990s after he starred alongside her brother, Joaquin, in the movie To Die For.
"She was going out with someone else and I said, 'Man, she's cute,' and [Joaquin] said, 'You should see if she'll go out with you ... don't worry about that dude,'" Casey Affleck said to  in 2013.
"So he was leaving town one day and said, 'My sister's in my apartment and she's all by herself - would you mind checking in on her?' So I checked in on her, and it stuck."
Casey Affleck won the Oscar for Best Actor earlier this year for his role in Manchester by the Sea.
