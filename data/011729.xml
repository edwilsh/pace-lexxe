  <title>Mystery of missing Tassie man solved</title>
  <content>
SKELETAL remains found inside a submerged car in Queensland's Wide Bay region have been confirmed as a Tasmanian man who has been missing for 13 years.
Stuart Gatehouse was 45 when he vanished during a trip from Kenilworth to Gympie in 2004.
In April, police removed Gatehouse's vehicle, with remains inside, from Borumba Dam near Imbil.
The death is not being treated as suspicious.
