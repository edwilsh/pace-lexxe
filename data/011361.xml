  <title>Roof of Melbourne train catches fire</title>
  <content>
The roof of a Melbourne train has caught fire and forced passengers to rush to the back carriage.
A witness told AAP she saw the train's connection to the power lines exploding and the top of the first carriage catch fire on Thursday morning.
Passengers inside rushed to the third carriage to escape the blaze, which is at this stage contained to the roof.
