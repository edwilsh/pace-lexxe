  <title>Qld premier 'short-sighted': NZ minister</title>
  <content>
New Zealand's trade minister has accused Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk of being "short-sighted" over her new buy local policy and decision to turn her back on a long-standing agreement between the two countries.
Todd McClay told ABC Radio on Friday he didn't think it was legally possible to ignore the free-trade agreement but also said it would lead to a downturn in the Queensland and New Zealand economies.
"One, it's disappointing and two, it's just not how trade works, it's a little bit crazy," he said.
