  <title>'I did nothing', mum tells torture trial</title>

FIRST, the door of the girl's room was kept open.

Soon, she was kept inside with the door closed, handle removed and no way out.

That was the evidence of the girl's mother on Monday, at the trial of a 58-year-old man who has pleaded not guilty to torture.

The mother told Brisbane District Court the man on trial advised her to smack the girl, "put her in a naughty chair, or put her in her room".

The jury heard the mother was herself jailed in relation to the child's treatment.

The mother admitted she and another adult also put the girl in the room to punish her.

"She wouldn't go in. She screamed and yelled every time," she told the court.

The mother said her daughter had "attitude problems" which included screaming, not listening and throwing clean clothes around.

The man facing trial twice used a cup to pour water on the girl's head when she was on the naughty chair, the witness said.

"She would freak out. She would start crying, that she had water poured on her," the mother said.

Crown Prosecutor Victoria Trafford-Walker asked the mother why she went along with it.

"I just don't know," she said. "I did nothing. I felt scared and intimidated that if I said something I would be abused myself."

Defence barrister Simon Hamlyn-Harris earlier told the court his client provided parenting advice and bought the girl a bed.

He said his client "never suggested" the girl be locked up for a long time.

Mr Hamlyn-Harris said a desire to help the parents with their troubled child motivated his client.

The trial continues. -NewsRegional
