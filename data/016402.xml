Joel Selwood leaves the ground with an ankle injury

GEELONG captain Joel Selwood has injured his ankle late in the second quarter of the clash against the Swans at Simonds Stadium.

Selwood jumped in a marking contest and landed awkwardly on teammate Zac Smith's foot and was unable to put any pressure on his left foot as he was helped from the ground.

More to come.
