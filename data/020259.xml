The Illawarra Premier League relegation battle is poised to go down to the wire after Corrimal Rangers came from behind to snatch a 1-1 draw with cellar-dwellers Picton Rangers on Sunday.
Playing in his first game since joining from the Wollongong Wolves, Corrimal's Nico Bernal scored just after the hour mark to cancel out Brendan Berkeley's 53rd minute opener.
The result ensures Picton stay bottom of the competition for another week on goal difference.
Picton (11 points) are six behind Woonona (11 points) on goal difference, with Corrimal (12 points) still well and truly in the relegation scrap.
Picton, who played finals football in 2016, and the Sharks meet on what is shaping as a massive encounter on the final day of the regular season. 
Cringila (17 points) moved further clear of the drop zone on Sunday with a determined 1-0 win over South Coast United at Ian McLennan Park.
