  <title>Vic man stole $1200 handbag for girlfriend</title>

A young Melbourne man stole a $1200 handbag from Myer because he wanted to make his girlfriend happy on her birthday, a court has heard.
Daniel Porter, 20, has been fined $250 for stealing the pricey designer handbag from the CBD store on Friday evening.
He was caught and arrested, admitting he nabbed the bag because he only earned $50 a week working part-time at a clothing store and couldn't afford it.
"From what I've heard it was to please your girlfriend," Melbourne Magistrate Alan Spillane said as Porter faced court on Saturday.
"This is a very significant theft. It's not just a simple shoplifting.
"But you're a young man and have time to turn your life around."
Porter was fined for the theft and released from custody.
