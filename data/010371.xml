  <title>Torrens Park house hit by gusher</title>
  <content>
A TORRENS Park road remains closed this morning after an overnight gusher sent water and debris flying through the air.
The burst main, on Pamela Rd, was reported just before 2am.
The water stream hit powerlines and a nearby house before SA Water crews arrived to turn off the supply.
Traffic restrictions remain in place as the clean-up continues.
