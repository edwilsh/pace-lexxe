  <title>Panthers keen to keep hold of rookie</title>
  <content>
PENRITH has hatched a plan to sign rookie fullback Dylan Edwards on a long-term deal.
Edwards has been a sensation for the Panthers this season, starring in his 11 games thus far.
As a successful product of Penrith's junior system, the club wants to extend his contract that expires at the end of 2018.
Panthers chairman Brian Fletcher confirmed Edwards was part of the club's plans for the future.
The 21-year-old delivered was at his best in Penrith's win over the Wests Tigers on Sunday - scoring a try and running for a game-high 206 metres.
"Dylan is long-term for sure," Fletcher said.
"Phil Gould would be swirling something around in his head - because we have no intention in letting him go anywhere."
Fletcher also confirmed Penrith were edging closer to extending coach Anthony Griffin, who still has a season to run on his current deal.
"We've always looked at him as a long-term coach and in a month we'll be talking to him for sure," he said.
"We won't be waiting until the middle of next year to talk to him put it that way.
"I'm hoping it will be looked at prior to the end of this year."
