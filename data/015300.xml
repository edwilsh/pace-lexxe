  <title>Nine could fast-track Ninja Warrior</title>
  <content>
CHANNEL 9 is having discussions about fast-tracking the filming of a second season of Australian Ninja Warrior so that it can screen straight after the 2018 Commonwealth Games.
The move comes as rival Seven, which owns the rights to the Games, toys with the idea of making an Aussie version of Ninja-like Spartan Ultimate Team Challenge.
Nine had originally planned to begin filming a second season of in November and December to screen in July 2018.
But now Nine insiders say the network is seriously considering changing those plans. That is because Nine bosses think viewers will be primed for more sports-based entertainment after the Games which will screen on Seven from April 4 to 15.
"Nine is programming aggressively to capitalise on the anticipated interest in sports after the Commonwealth Games," a Nine insider says. "That (screening Australian Ninja Warrior in April) is what we look set to do."
Nine will have to get the skates on. The massive Australian Ninja Warrior set on Cockatoo Island was dismantled when filming of season one ended.
The finale of Australian Ninja Warrior, hosted by Ben Fordham and with Andrew "Freddie" Flintoff, was seen by more than 3 million viewers nationwide.
Another factor in Nine's thinking would be that Seven will use the Commonwealth Games, to be held on the Gold Coast, as a launch-pad for a range of midyear shows.
Nine would want to blunt that impact with a certified ratings phenomenon.
The success of Australian Ninja Warrior has reportedly led Seven to considering making a local version of Spartan Ultimate Team Challenge.
That show, which began screening in the USA in July 2016, features teams of five, including an "elite Spartan athlete", taking on a challenging mile-long obstacle course over fire, water and mud.
