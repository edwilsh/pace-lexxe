  <title>Callaghan doubles hopes for qualifiers</title>
  <content>
HOPEFUL: Mark Callaghan is in the hunt for a first Newcastle premiership.

Morisset trainer-driver Mark Callaghan will look to Lovin Miss Daisy and Highview Freddy to lead the way on Saturday night as he strives for a first Newcastle drivers' premiership.
Callaghan has two chances in each of the two Menangle country series heats on the nine-race program, as well as Rave Moonraker in the fast-class event.

Sitting one win behind Newcastle drivers' premiership leader Brad Elder, Callaghan will take the reins on Lovin Miss Daisy in the C2-C3 heat in which he also has Lethal Star. He will then drive Highview Freddy from gate one in the C0-C1 qualifier in which he also has Just Pit Boss. Will Rixon will drive Callaghan's other hopes.
He said Red Ochre Mares Classic runner-up Lovin Miss Daisy was his best hope.
"Lovin Miss Daisy's had a little freshen up but her form before that was good, so she should go close to winning," Callaghan said. "Lethal Star is in good form but Lovin Miss Daisy will be up on the pace and Lethal Star usually settles off it. They both should run well.

"Highview Freddy is coming back from a break and has had only four runs for me for one win and three seconds. He'll be up on the pace.
"Just Pit Boss is a new acquisition to the stable and trialed well last week. I don't know a lot about him yet but he seems to be working OK."
Callaghan has won nine Menangle Country Series finals.
