  <title>Qld behind in writing skills, NAPLAN shows</title>
  <content>
Queensland school students are on par with other states in reading and spelling but are falling behind in writing, preliminary NAPLAN results show.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk on Wednesday said 240,000 Queensland students in Years 3, 5, 7 and 9 had completed the annual national test, which covers reading, writing, spelling, grammar/punctuation and numeracy.
"Overall, Queensland's strongest results occurred in Years 3, 5 and 7 and numeracy was a standout area of improvement across all year levels," she said.
