  <title>We've gone from bare feet to bytes</title>
  <content>
IF there is one area where there have been major changes since 1967, it's education.
Fifty years ago no one could have imagined that children would move from marbles and maypole dancing to mobile phones and laptops.
Computers in the classroom was an unthinkable concept as recently as the 1980s and no one could have even imagined the Sunshine Coast would one day be home to a fully-fledged university hosting students from around the world.
It was a more care-free world when a five-year-old Ashley Robinson rode his bike to school through the canefields or Tim Abbott swapped the uniforms of suburban Sydney for shorts, t-shirt and bare feet in Maroochydore.
Private schools were another aspect of the education system that was nowhere to be seen on the Sunshine Coast in 1967 but today we are home to several.
Some schools have disappeared since 1967 but many others have been born to cope with the region's population growth.
And thne there's the students.
Have they changed much in the past five decades.
Sure they know their way around a laptop and can type a text message at the speed of light but if you ask Linda Baggs, who has stood in front a classroom at Mooloolaba Primary School for almost 30 years, kids are still kids.
And that's what makes it all worthwhile.
