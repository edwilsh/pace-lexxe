  <title>10 things you need to know before European markets open</title>
  <content>
Good morning! Here's what you need to know.

1.  It is the first time the British side has put a figure on its so-called Brexit bill - although the sum falls well short of the â‚¬100-billion sum discussed in Brussels.

2.  The firm, which provides workspace for users as varied as freelancers, entrepreneurs and corporations, said it will buy Singaporean peer Spacemob for an undisclosed amount, and that it will retain Spacemob's management team.

3  Toyota rallied 2.3% to 6,360 yen, the highest level since mid-March, after the world's No.2 automaker raised its full-year outlook on Friday thanks to favourable exchange rates.

4.  One day after Council members voted unanimously for a partial ban on exports aimed at slashing Pyongyang's foreign revenue by a third, top diplomats from the key powers in the dispute met in Manila.

5.  The company, whose biggest shareholders include the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Macquarie, has appointed Barclays, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and JP Morgan for the listing.

6.  Stephan Weil, already facing an unexpected election after the defection of a member of his ruling coalition to Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, is under fire for what some see as a too-cosy relationship with VW.

7. . King - who said in December that Britain should leave the EU's single market and possibly its customs union - said his country needed to be able to show that it had a clear plan of how it would manage without an EU trade deal.

8.  The government said it was still committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in line with its existing legal commitments, but also wanted to reduce Britain's energy costs to the lowest in Europe.

9.  The EU first imposed sanctions on Russia after the 2014 military annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. On Friday, it introduced additional measures in response to the delivery of Siemens' gas turbines to Crimea, which violated its existing sanctions.

10.  Under the leadership of Chairman Guo Shuqing, the China Banking Regulatory Commission started the year promising a "windstorm" to clean up the banking sector, which had been seen as failing to control risks as credit swelled.
