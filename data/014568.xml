  <title>The New York Mets lost a game in one of the saddest ways possible</title>
  <content>
The New York Mets and Colorado Rockies found themselves in a storybook baseball situation on Thursday afternoon, the type of scenario that kids across America silently repeat to themselves over and over while taking batting practice or warming up their pitching arm.

Bottom of the 9th. Bases loaded. Full count. It all comes down to this.

These were exactly the stakes as Mets reliever faced down Nolan Arenado. Hansel Robles. Robles wound up, and, well, you can watch what happened below.

Not even close.

Baseball is a brutal game but even casual fans can recognise that as an especially rough day at the office. The walk-off walk only gets worse when you consider how the Mets found themselves in that bases loaded jam.

After the game, Robles would say  and couldn't feel the ball through the ninth inning, information he did not share with his coaches or teammates until after the game.

Needless to say, Mets fans were not pleased with the result.

The Mets are currently 49-57 and 11.5 games out of the NL Wild Card.

A literal . ????

Rockies' game-winning rally: Hit by pitch. Sac. Intentional walk. Walk. Walk.

If Hansel Robles felt numbness in his hand to the first batter of the 9th inning, he should have probably told somebody...
