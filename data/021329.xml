  <title>Dianella Plaza store goes up in flames</title>
  <content>
FIRE has ripped through a small store at a Dianella shopping centre.
The fire started just before 8.30 last night in a kiosk at Dianella Plaza, at the corner of Grand Promenade and Alexander Drive.
Four fire-fighting crews rushed to the blaze, which had mainly been contained by the shopping centre's sprinkler system.
It took 17 firefighters about 30 minutes to extinguish the flames, preventing the fire from spreading to nearby stores.
The cause of the fire is believed to have been accidental and no one was injured.
The damage bill is estimated at $50,000.
