  <title>Aust households in need tipped to rise</title>
  <content>
Almost 15 per cent of Australian households either require public and community housing or need some form of assistance to make their rental homes affordable, new research shows.
The Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute found 1.3 million households are either unable to access the ownership or rental markets, or spend such a significant proportion of their income on rent that they require some form of assistance to avoid financial stress.
The Curtin University and the University of Adelaide researchers predict that figure will reach 1.7 million, or about 16 per cent of all households, by 2025.
Housing need is set to rise in most states and territories, lead author Associate Professor Steven Rowley from Curtin University said on Wednesday.
"Our findings show the scale of affordable housing necessary to meet housing need and the challenge faced by state and local governments to deliver such housing," he said.
The report estimates 527,400 households are currently unable to access home ownership or the private rental market, and predicted that will reach 678,300 in 2025.
A further 806,100 households currently require some form of assistance to make their private rental housing affordable, and avoid being in a position of rental stress where they are paying more than 30 per cent of their income in housing costs.
The modelling predicts that will rise to 1.07 million by 2025.
The researchers said the majority of households currently in housing need will require Commonwealth rent assistance to help them in the private rental market, while about 40 per cent require public and community housing or some other form of subsidised affordable rental housing.
