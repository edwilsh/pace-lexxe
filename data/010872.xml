21 MINS AGO  UPDATED 1 MIN AGO

Three former NSW Labor ministers engaged in serious corrupt conduct, the Independent Commission Against Corruption has found.

The long-awaited report from ICAC's investigation into the controversial water infrastructure company Australian Water Holdings, released on Thursday, made no corrupt findings against federal senator Arthur Sinodinos.

Tony Kelly, Eddie Obeid and Joe Tripodi, however, did engage in serious corrupt conduct in relation to their actions concerning a public-private partnership proposal by the water company, the ICAC found.
