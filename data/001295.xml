The VPA Studios student competed in the Kids Artistic Revue (KAR) USA National Finals and placed first in the 13 years Elite Jazz division, third in the 13 years Elite Lyrical division and finished in the top six of the Elite Teens division.
"The competition was so fierce and she was the youngest of the top six so that was an amazing result. She has a beautiful crown, sash and huge trophies," her mother Belinda said.
"She was so inspired by the incredible competition over there that her aim is to train even harder now and go back next year to compete again."
