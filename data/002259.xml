Devastated at the news that our dear friend & colleague Les Murray has passed away. A great Australian who really has left a great legacy.

Les Murray brought the world game to Australian homes. He was the voice of famous victory and heartbreaking defeat, of joy and despair. Vale

Football, salami, Euro accent + SBS. Being a "wog" was so cool thanks to Les.

I can't remember football without Les when the game needed someone to champion he was always there spirit passion a great man a great loss
