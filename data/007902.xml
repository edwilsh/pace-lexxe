Motorists in Brisbane are paying more for short-term off-street parking than any other capital city in Australia.
The latest parking report from the RACQ showed that Brisbane topped Sydney and Melbourne when it came to parking for an hour or less.
It also found the number of parking stations that charged maximum daily rates of $89 had tripled in the past 12 months.
"More than 150 off-street car parks were tested finding 2,500 different prices across the car parks," RACQ's Paul Turner said.
"When it comes to parking 30 minutes to an hour, we are the most expensive in the country.
"We're more expensive than Sydney, which is a pretty expensive market."
Mr Turner said the average price was $28.32 for one hour's off-street parking in the Brisbane CBD.
"What we're seeing is interesting trends because once you get past an hour, then Sydney becomes number one," he told
"We're also seeing day rates going up, with the average price being $73 for eight hours.
"There's 11 parking stations in the CBD that charge the maximum rate of $89 a day."
Visitors to the CBD losing out

Mr Turner said people living in the suburbs were the real losers in the parking battle as it stopped many from visiting the CBD.

"What's interesting is that you'll pay $70 for four hours so once you're there you might as well stay for the day," he said.
"The people this parking is penalising is the casual diner or someone coming into the city to see a movie or the like.
"If people are staying for a full day you can make savings in the CBD, but it stops people from the suburbs coming in to visit the city.
"Once you put the extra cost, for example $45 for two hours, on top of your meal, it makes it a very expensive meal or movie."
How to save when it comes to parking

Brisbane is known to have limited competition when it comes to off-street parking in the CBD, but Mr Turner suggested motorists could save by planning ahead.
"Booking in advance online is a great way to save money," he said.
"The early-bird rates are good if you can get in before 7:00am or 8:00am in the morning with $31, and our weekday nights are cheaper than Sydney.
"The two cheapest in the city are King George Square and Wickham Terrace and both are operated by Brisbane City Council with rates of $35 a day, a third of what you can pay at commercial operators."
