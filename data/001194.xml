  <title>Dylan Lanc-Quin apologises over hit-and-run Adelaide death of Harley Chester</title>
  <content>
An apology has been offered in court by an Adelaide man who was under the influence of methamphetamine, cannabis and alcohol when his car hit and killed another man in early 2016.
Harley James Chester, 28, died when teenager Dylan Michael Lanc-Quin hit him while he was crossing Victoria Road at Largs North in February last year.
The Adelaide District Court heard Lanc-Quin, who was 19 at the time of the crash, was speeding, disqualified from driving and under the influence of alcohol and drugs.
Lanc-Quin pleaded guilty to an aggravated count of death by dangerous driving and leaving an accident scene.
Defence lawyer Stacey Carter said Lanc-Quin was in shock when he fled after the crash, but "never intended to hurt anyone".
The young man read an apology to the court, as the victim's family watched proceedings.
"I am really sorry for the pain that I have caused you," he said.
"This is an accident I will always have nightmares about.
"There is no excuse for my actions [but] I have learned from my mistakes."
'You left him to die'

The victim's twin sister, Tarita Chester, told the court she had become "severely depressed" since her brother's death.

"You have scarred my soul for life [and] I will never be the same again following the loss of my twin," she said.
"I love my twin brother more than anyone could ever love or care about someone.
"I didn't get a hug and a kiss to let him know it was all OK - it wasn't all OK- you left him to die."
Lanc-Quin ran to his grandmother's house after the crash, the court was told.
He admitted he was the person behind the wheel when police turned up to arrest him, it was told.
The defence did not argue for any suspended jail sentence but sought that Lanc-Quin be given a shorter-than-usual non-parole term in light of his early guilty pleas.
Chief Judge Michael Evans will pass sentence in August.
