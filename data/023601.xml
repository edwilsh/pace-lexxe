SOUL pioneer Kylie Auldist will bring funk to Oakleigh when she performs at the Caravan Music Club.
Auldist will sing two sets including acoustic and electro-soul to celebrate the release of her fourth solo album Family Tree.
She will perform dance hits This Girl and Ride of Your Life.
Auldist said she was looking forward to performing to her loyal fans.
"My fans are really everything and I can't wait to sing to them in this special and intimate show," she said.
"I haven't done a show in two months so I'm pretty stoked about getting back into it."
Auldist said she was so thrilled about her track with Kungs vs. Cookin' on 3 Burners This Girl, which reached number one in France, Germany and Portugal.
"It's had more than 250,000 million views on YouTube so I'm really grateful."
She said she planned on setting new goals and continuing to tour.
"I would love to sing the national anthem at the Grand Final one day."
"There will be lots of dancing at this upcoming show and it's going to be a great night."
Kylie Auldist will perform at the Caravan Music Club on Friday, August 25.
