  <title>Les Murray's state funeral confirmed for late SBS football broadcaster</title>
  <content>
Sydney's St Mary's Cathedral will host a state funeral for much-loved football broadcaster Les Murray next week.
The SBS doyen has been honoured with the service, to be held on Monday, for his passionate support for the sport over a 35-year career.
In later life, Murray switched his advocacy to refugees and multiculturalism.
Guests are being encouraged to wear white to the service "in honour of a multicultural world".
Murray emigrated from Hungary as a child before rising to become the public face of the world game in Australia.
Members of the public are welcome to attend the service, which begins at 11:00am.
Murray died last Monday, aged 71, after a battle with illness.
