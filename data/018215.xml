Two separate fires at Gold Coast primary schools this week have been declared as suspicious by police.

The first suspected arson attack happened on Wednesday at Miami State School on Oceanic Drive at Mermaid Waters.
Emergency services were called about 7.20pm and extinguished a small fire in one of the classrooms, which caused only minor damage.
On Friday, a second fire broke out at St Vincent's Primary School on Fairway Drive at Clear Island Waters.
Emergency services responded about 9.15pm and once again found a small fire inside one of the classrooms, which was quickly extinguished and did not cause any structural damage.
However, both fires did cause some smoke damage to the classrooms.
Anyone with information about the incidents or who may have witnessed anything suspicious is asked to contact police.
