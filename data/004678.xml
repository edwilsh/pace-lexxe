  <title>Curious elephant seal 'plays tourist' in South Australian town</title>
  <content>
A curious elephant seal has been spotted 'playing tourist' in the South Australian town of Port MacDonnell.
A local spotted the surprise visitor napping on his doorstep last night, before the massive mammal set off to explore the streets of the sea-side town.
Members of the public contacted community ranger Dale Millar this morning after becoming concerned for the elephant seal's safety.
Mr Millar was filmed using a wheelie bin to carefully guide the animal back to the beach, where it has since returned to the ocean.
