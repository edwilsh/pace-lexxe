  <title>Up close and personal with a smiling shark</title>
  <content>
A three-metre great white shark was all too ready for its close-up when it chomped down on a scientist's camera, baring its rows of razor sharp teeth.  
The predator was being filmed in the murky water off the east coast of the United States when it suddenly attacked the GoPro - showing off one of the most feared sights on the planet - the inside of its mouth.
The animal appeared to ominously grin at the device before it gripped the GoPro with its pearly whites and attempted to take a bite out of it.
Scientist Greg Skomal with the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries was on an underwater research trip at the time of the attack.
He was not hurt in the close encounter and insists the camera survived too.
