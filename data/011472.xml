  <title>Tasmanian man faces cannabis trafficking charges after $500k hydroponic haul found</title>
  <content>
A southern Tasmanian man has been charged with drug trafficking after police uncovered an elaborate hydroponic cannabis operation.

Police have seized more than 8 kilograms of cannabis buds, 25 mature plants and 47 small cannabis plants with an estimated value of $520,000.
Officers conducted a series of raids in the northern Hobart suburb of Glenorchy.
It is alleged they found the hydroponic set-ups at two properties owned by a 41-year-old Glenorchy man.
He has been charged with trafficking in a controlled substance.
The man has been bailed to appear in court next month.
