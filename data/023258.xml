  <title>Illness forces Andrews government minister Fiona Richardson to take leave</title>
  <content>
Victoria's Minister for Women Fiona Richardson says she is taking a short leave of absence amid treatment for a "serious illness".
Ms Richardson underwent successful surgery after becoming unwell shortly before state parliament's mid-winter break, a statement on Sunday said.
"I expected to be able to return to my ministerial and parliamentary duties in August, however, my recovery has been slower than I hoped," she said.
"I will be taking a further three weeks leave of absence."
In the meantime, Health Minister Jill Hennessy will take over Ms Richardson's portfolios of Women and the Prevention of Family Violence.
Parliament will resume for the second half of the year on Tuesday.
