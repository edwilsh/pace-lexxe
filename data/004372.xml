A woman attacked by a kangaroo on a Gold Coast golf course suffered a deep cut to the back of her head that required stitches.
The Queensland Ambulance Service's Bill Houghton said the woman was set upon by the marsupial about 8.10am on Tuesday when she came to the aid of a man on the Hope Island driving range.
The woman, who was released from hospital later in the day, also suffered minor cuts and bruises to her back and hands.
