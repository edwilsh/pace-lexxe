Conor McGregor's challenge
1:04

Conor McGregor may be one of the hardest punchers in the UFC and MMA but switching to boxing to fight the undefeated Floyd 'Money' Mayweather will present the biggest challenge of his career, with the two sports being more different than meets the eye.

AMIR KAHN has said that Floyd Mayweather's highly anticipated fight against Conor McGregor will be a "sh*t fight" and a wholly one-sided contest.
The British boxer wanted to fight the reigning Irish UFC lightweight champion prior to the Mayweather fight announcement.
"I think it's going to be a sh*t fight," the former unified light-welterweight world champion told Gulf News.
"It's all just talk at the moment. Mayweather will simply outclass him.
"I mean, if you look at it, it's not really a fight. McGregor has no boxing background and experience.
"I can safely predict a horrible knockout," said Khan.

The 30-year-old applauds the Irishman's approach to the fight from a business aspect, but admits that his chances of beating the 49-0 American are slim.
"McGregor has nothing to lose in that sense, and at the end of it all, he will make a cool $100 (Â£77m). It's good business."

Khan contemplated a move back to MMA in March after being spotted ringside at UFC 208.

The British boxer said: "Mayweather will have his first knockout since he knocked out Ricky Hatton. He's not had a KO for the past six years.
"But with this one against McGregor he is bound to be an easy winner." the 30-year-old predicted.
"It would be a great way for Mayweather to end this is he knocks out a MMA superstar like McGregor, who very well knows that this is a free fight for him.
"You know why? Because he can go back and just turn around and say that he's lost a boxing fight to an actual boxer.
"He can always say 'I have never been a boxer. I've always been an MMA fighter'. McGregor has nothing to loose."
The British Olympian hit the headlines this week following his bitter love split with partner Faryal Makhdoom.
