  <content>
The owner of a restaurant was bashed with a weapon during an attempted armed robbery in Albion Park on Sunday night.

A 63-year-old man closed his Tongarra Road business and went to walk outside about 7.45pm when he was approached by a man who had his face concealed, police said.
The man demanded cash. When he was told there was no cash on the premises, the armed man began to hit the owner a number of times across the head with a weapon.
He then ran off in the direction of a nearby shopping centre.
A number of people came to the injured man's aid, before he was taken to Wollongong Hospital by paramedics.
He received treatment for deep lacerations to his head and is now in a stable condition.
Lake Illawarra police are looking for a man described as being about 183cm tall, with a medium build and was wearing dark coloured clothing.
Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000
