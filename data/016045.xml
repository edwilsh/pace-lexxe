  <content>
A police officer has been injured in a scuffle with a man who allegedly broke into a woman's home and trawled through magazines.
A 35-year-old Frankston woman called police when she discovered the 27-year-old in her home during the early hours of this morning.
"Officers entered the residence to find the alleged burglar... casually reading through material that was on the living room mantel piece," Victoria Police spokeswoman Natalie Savino said.
The police officer was taken to hospital with a possible forearm injury.
The man was arrested and will be interviewed by police.
