GARTH'S untimely death in Barcelona is a tragic loss for the Sunshine Coast (Daily, August 1)
He took every opportunity, both at home and overseas, to advocate for his beloved Sunshine Coast.
As a foundation member of the Sunshine Coast Major Events Board in 2013, Garth brought a wealth of events experience, knowledge and wisdom to the work of the board.
Our condolences to Garth's family and friends at this very sad time.
There has been no better ambassador for our beautiful region than Garth Prowd OAM.
