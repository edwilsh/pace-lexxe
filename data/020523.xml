An alleged knife-wielding man has been shot by police during a confrontation in northern NSW.
Police first tasered then shot the man, who they say was holding a knife, after they arrived at a unit in Grafton following a report of a disturbance.
He was taken to Grafton Hospital in a critical condition, while a critical incident team will now investigate the circumstances of the shooting.
