  <title>Kendall Jenner exposes nipples in sheer Aussie designed top</title>
  <content>
THE Aussie designers behind label Bec and Bridge have defended a daring sheer design, after it was modelled by Kendall Jenner yesterday.

Social media erupted after the 22-year-old model stepped out braless in the see-through top. But creators Bridget Yorston and Becky Cooper basked in the attention.

Cooper told The Daily Telegraph that because "Kendall's wardrobe is in such high demand" they've since been inundated by requests to buy the French Kiss shirt.

Yorston added: "We love working with Kendall because she has an amazing sense of style and always puts our pieces together so well."

The shirt is part of the brand's Resort 18 collection, which will hit shops in October. For those wanting to cover up a little more than Jenner, the designers also created camisoles and bralettes to wear underneath.

The model is the latest in a line of celebrities to bare their breasts in the name of fashion, with supermodel Bella Hadid and Jenner's older sister Kim Kardashian West also fans of the braless look.
