A MAN is on the run after a failed break-in at a western suburbs supermarket.
Police were called to the Drakes Foodland, at the Fulham Gardens Shopping Centre, on the corner of Tapleys Hill and Valetta roads, just after 315am on Sunday.
When patrols arrived, they discovered a roller door had been forced open and a failed attempt had been made to jemmy open a cigarette kiosk.
Police say nothing appeared stolen but that the suspect was captured on the store's security cameras.
He is described as being of caucasian appearance, wearing a dark grey hooded jumper, light grey tracksuit pants, white shoes and carrying a hessian bag.
Police urged anyone who may have seen any suspicious activity in the area to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
