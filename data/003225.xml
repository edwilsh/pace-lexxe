  <title>Scaramucci loses White House role</title>
  <content>
US PRESIDENT Trump has decided to remove Anthony Scaramucci from his position as communications director, just over a week after he took on the job.
that three people close to the decision said on Monday that he had relieved him just days after Mr Scaramucci unloaded a crude verbal tirade against other senior members of the president's senior staff.
The decision to remove Mr Scaramucci reportedly came at the request the new chief of staff, John F Kelly, who was just appointed on Monday in his new role.
Mr Scaramucci's abrupt removal came just 10 days after he was brought on to the West Wing staff, a move that convulsed an already chaotic White House and led to the departures of Sean Spicer, the former press secretary, and Reince Priebus, the president's first chief of staff.
