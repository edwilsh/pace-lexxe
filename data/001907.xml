  <title>A Sydney dad arrested for illegal guns allegedly let his 4-year-old daughter play with a Colt .45 -- after he pretended to shoot her with it</title>

A 32-year-old man from Revesby in Sydney's west, charged with multiple firearms offences, has shocked terrorism police who discovered phone video footage of him allegedly pointing a Colt .45 at his four-year-old daughter and pulling the trigger.

Detectives were shocked again when they allegedly found further footage of the child playing with the pistol and pulling the trigger - thankfully without effect.

A , on average.

The man has been charged with six offences including four counts of illegal firearm possession, and the production/possession of child abuse material, as a result of allegedly filming the young girl handling the gun.

Police have seized a 25 calibre Walther TP-model pistol, two Colt 1911 45 calibre automatic pistols and a Bentley-brand 12-gauge shotgun from addresses at Revesby and Granville, but say the incident was not terror-related. The officers were investigating illegal firearms.

Police have condemned the alleged behaviour captured on film.

"Allowing a child to play with a firearm of any kind is reprehensible and is a serious criminal offence," assistant commissioner, Mark Murdoch, said.

The father has been remanded in custody and ordered to appear in Burwood Local Court on Wednesday, 16 August.
