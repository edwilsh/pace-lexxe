  <title>Doctor's dire warning to woman</title>
  <content>
WHEN simply moving became painful for Townsville woman Lorna Murphy, she know something was wrong.
And when she visited her doctor, he was blunt.
"He told me if I didn't lose weight I would need a knee replacement and I wouldn't be able to work," Ms Murphy said.
She has since been on a mission to lose weight and now, five years later, she has lost 50kg and will run her first marathon at age 50.
Ms Murphy said she had come a long way since the "bad days".
"The pain was so bad it took me half an hour to get up 13 stairs," she said.
Her diet had included a can of soft drink and bar of chocolate every day.
She received medical advice to only eat vegetarian food for a month and to avoid processed food.
It was the start of a lifestyle change which included hiring a personal trainer.
"I continued on with her and learned how to eat better and did all the fitness training,' Ms Murphy said.
"It took me five years to lose 50kg.
"I had to learn step by step how to eat properly and how much I should eat."
Now Ms Murphy is ready to attempt her first marathon during the Townsville Running Festival.
"I made a goal when I did a half marathon that when I turned 50 I would run a marathon," she said.
"I now love running. I'll run for every single reason I used to eat."
The Townsville Running Festival will be held on Sunday.
She said what people ate was more important in dieting than trying to eat less.
She admitted she used to turn to food when she was stressed or emotional but is now dedicated to changing her habits and finding healthy outlets for that same stress and emotion.
"I now love running, I'll run for every single reason I used to eat for," she said.
"When I run I switch off from work. Running is the way I meditate."
