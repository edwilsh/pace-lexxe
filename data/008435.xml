, has price hopes of $860,000-$940,000.

ONE half of indie pop duo Gypsy & the Cat is hoping to release his cool Clifton Hill warehouse home to a new owner at auction today.
Lionel Towers - who formed the band with fellow Melbourne DJ Xavier Bacash in 2010 - is set to sendunder the hammer with price hopes of $860,000-$940,000.

Gypsy and the Cat.

Nelson Alexander, Fitzroy, selling agent James Pilliner said the musician and his partner Christina Delaney had substantially renovated the home since moving in about three years ago, installing a music studio among other funky features.
CoreLogic records indicate the pair paid $687,000 for the apartment in early 2014.
"Lionel does a lot of work from home in the studio," Mr Pilliner said.

2/41 Dally St, Clifton Hill.

"They've also added in feature woodwork, a new stairwell, new bathroom and new lighting. They've just made it homely."
Towers and Bacash burst on to the Australian and UK music scene with their debut album Gilgamesh, which was released in late 2010 and received significant airplay on Triple J and commercial radio stations.

Inside the funky home.

The pair was the support act for Kylie Minogue's Aphrodite Tour in Australia in 2011 and released its latest album Virtual Islands last year.
Mr Pilliner said the home - built into a 1900s warehouse in the 1990s - had a flexible 140sq m floorplan that spread across three levels of different sizes. "You could make the studio a third bedroom or a study, or have multiple living zones," he said.

Its north-facing aspect allowed natural light to flood in, and its ceilings stretched 4m high in some parts of the residence, he said.
Mr Pilliner said another highlight was the home's position in a residential Clifton Hill area, close to cafes, the train station and trams, and both Mayors Park and Darling Gardens.
Towers and Delaney were selling because they planned to move to a house with a garden for their dog, he said.
