  <title>8@eight: ASX set to open flat as investors wait for Crown, RBA</title>
  <content>
The Australian market looks set to open flat after an uninspiring mixed session on Wall Street, which was marked by the news that a grand jury will investigate Russia's interference in last year's US presidential election. 
SPI futures were down one point, or 0.02 per cent, at 5,664 at 7am in Sydney.

Can earnings shake life back into the ASX 200?

What to expect this week as the corporate reporting calendar starts. This video was produced in commercial partnership between Fairfax Media and IG Markets.

In the US, stocks mainly lost a little ground amid falls in tech giants Apple and Amazon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.04 per cent to end at an all time high of 22,0261, having breached the 22,000 mark on Wednesday. The S&P 500 lost 0.22 per cent and the Nasdaq dropped 0.35 per cent.
Locally, in economic news on Friday, the Reserve Bank releases its Statement on Monetary Policy, while the Australian Bureau of Statistics releases July's retail trade figures.
Tabcorp and Crown Resorts are expected to release full-year results, while the market continues to digest the implications of the money laundering case affecting the Commonwealth Bank. 
​The long and short of it

You wouldn't know it given the US volatility index ("VIX") is up 1 per cent at 10.39 per cent, or by looking at the fact gold is only up 0.2 per cent or the S&P 500 only down 0.2 per cent, but we have seen a unwind of the carry trade with strong gains in both the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc with very modest signs of risk aversion playing through markets. 

1. Russia probe: We can partly explain the bid in bonds on the WSJ headlines that "Special Counsel Mueller impanels Washington grand jury in Russia probe". Using a grand jury provides increased investigative powers in the investigation, such the ability to subpoena documents and seek indictments (if there is evidence of a crime).  It seems to have got a few market participants a tad more nervous, although perhaps not to the extent as Donald Trump junior. The impact has been limited in US equities, which fits into the view that the sharemarket doesn't really have a pulse anyhow, with implied volatility just so low.
2. Bank of England: The British pound has been helped along by the news that there were only two dissenters in the Bank of England (Andy Haldane didn't join the hike camp, so the split sat at 6-2), but importantly the BoE cut wage growth forecasts and now see 3 per cent in 2018 (from 3.5 per cent in May).

3. US dollar: The US dollar more broadly, (if we use the US dollar index) has seen only modest selling. The lack of any real selling seems even more impressive given the ISM services index, a reading of service-sector activity in the US, fell 3.5 points to 53.9 in July, which despite a continued expansion in the service sector now sits at an 11-month low. Key aspects of the report such as new orders fell 5.4 points to 55.1, with business activity also falling quite hard. In other data points, factory orders gained a somewhat above consensus 3 per cent and while it's early days the US economy is probably tracking around 2.5 per cent in the September quarter.
A lot now hinges on US wage data tonight, coming out at 10:30pm AES, as part of the monthly payrolls report. Traders shouldn't even really be concerned by the actual jobs report, unless we see an absolute calamity of a number, say below 100,000 jobs or a 20 basis point rise in the unemployment rate. It's all about wages here, and that is what the fixed income and rates market are most intently focused on and specifically, if we can see more than a 30 basis point increase of wages (month-on-month) then perhaps, just perhaps, the US dollar can find some love. It would be a big surprise though and the higher probability is we get very an uninspiring read here. The fact the market is placing a 40 per cent probability of an interest rate hike in December (from the Federal Reserve) still seems fair.
4. Asian stocks. The focus though now turns to the open of the Asian equity markets and while as I mention the yen will be closely watched in currency land, and may weigh on the Nikkei 225.
5.The Aussie will also be a key focal point given we get the Reserve Bank Statement on Monetary Policy at 11:30 AEST. The Aussie traded largely unchanged overnight, although caught a bid into US79.14¢ when the US dollar responded to the Russia probe headlines. The prospect of a 50-75 basis point aggregate cut to the RBA's GDP forecasts over the coming few years seems largely assured given the comments about 3 per cent growth in the policy statement on Tuesday, but there is plenty more to look out for and traders will pour over every word for clues.
6. The Australian sharemarket: The ASX 200, itself, is eyeing an open at 5728, capping off what has been another week where the market has respected the trading range, which was an aspect I have been talking about for a while now. What can take the ASX 200 out of the 5800 to 5650 range? On the earnings front, Crown Resorts report, and after poor numbers from Suncorp and an uninspiring report (including capital management) from Rio Tinto, it would be welcomed to see Crown deliver something a bit more pleasing. Keep an eye for follow through selling on Suncorp though, as the flows were heavy on the short side yesterday and this could trade into $12.50 soon.
7. Commodities: We have seen a 0.9 per cent gain in spot iron ore, with iron ore futures also moving nicely higher and re-establishing that positive trend - keep trading this from the long side. Oil prices have slipped a touch, with US crude down 1.4 per cent, so this could weigh a touch on the sector today.  Gold looks quite attractive for a move higher too here, but again watch the US fixed income market.
