Pence blasts Russia's 'unacceptable' activities

US Vice President Mike Pence confirms President Donald Trump will sign a Congressional bill imposing new sanctions on Russia and warns North Korea that "all options are on the table".

The New York Times story said some Republicans were moving to form a "shadow campaign" for 2020 as though President Donald Trump were not involved. It said multiple advisers to Mr Pence "have already intimated to party donors that he would plan to run if Mr Trump did not." 
The rumoured Republican scenarios are based on an assumption that President Donald Trump may not run again. 

The report suggested that would-be candidates were cultivating some of the party's most prominent donors, courting conservative interest groups and carefully enhancing their profiles.
Mr Trump has given no indication that he will decline to seek a second term, but a controversial first six months and the cloud of Russia investigations hang over his presidency. Photo: AP
On the Democrat side, the former vice-president Joe Biden  about bid for the top job.
