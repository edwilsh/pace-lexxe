  <title>The most cowardly coward punch?</title>
  <content>
VIDEO showing the moment a man was floored by a coward punch, sending him flying about a metre before landing on pavement, has been released in a bid to find the culprit.
The CCTV footage showed a man wearing a black T-shirt and shorts outside the Liar's Bar on Burleigh Rd at Broadbeach, on the Gold Coast at about 12.45am on February 11.
Police said he had just been asked to leave the sports bar when he was filmed walking up to another man who he then punched in the head, knocking him back at least a metre onto the pavement.
The 26-year-old victim appeared to have his hands by his side and was talking to another man when he was hit.
The victim suffered multiple fractures and required surgery as a result of the attack.
Police would like to speak to the man seen in the footage to assist with inquiries.
Anyone with information can contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
