  <title>NZ shares fall, Kathmandu and Xero drop</title>
  <content>
New Zealand shares fell on Friday, with Kathmandu Holdings and Xero dropping while A2 Milk Co hit a record high.
The S&P/NZX 50 Index dropped 7.63 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 7746.12. Within the index, 22 stocks fell, 18 rose and 10 were unchanged. Turnover was $155.5 million.
Kathmandu dropped 1.8 per cent to $2.24. On Thursday, the retailer announced full-year profit rose as much as 13 per cent to between $37.4 million and $38m after a successful winter sales season and increased revenue from Australia.
"The week rolling they're down 3 per cent despite that guidance to the market - investors still have concerns about online retailing and weather patterns determining how sales mixes go," said Peter McIntyre, investment adviser at Craigs Investment Partners.
"That retail sector is weaker across the board, on low volume, it's still a very tough environment for retailers out there."
Xero gave up some recent gains, down 1.6 per cent to $27.36, with Fletcher Building also seeing some profit taking, dropping 1.1 per cent to $7.88.
"Even though we're trading near flat, we've had reasonable volume through the market," Mr McIntyre said.
"I think offshore investors have some more comfort about our inflation data and that the Reserve Bank are not going to increase interest rates.''
Summerset Group led the index lower, down 2.2 per cent to $4.87, while Trustpower fell 2.1 per cent to $5.70.
A2 Milk Co was the best performer on the index, up 3.6 per cent to $4.66, while Synlait Milk gained 0.4 per cent to $4.57.
A2 and Synlait released a statement saying the two are confident with the progress of their application to export a2 Platinum infant formula to China from January 2018.
