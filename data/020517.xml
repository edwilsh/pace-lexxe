  <content>
OUCH. Port Adelaide's cheer squad took first blood in Sunday's Showdown, with very cheeky wording on the Power's banner.
If you don't understand that last item,
Port's cheer squad had teased the banner the day before:
Twitter was swift to react.

Port's banner was ðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜‚

No issues with the Port banner. A little bit of banter is fine...as long as we win.
But not everyone saw the funny side.

Lol  banner, so let's do one for them on behalf of  hmm port fan checklist 1) don't show up 2) talk about the crows

Port Cheersquad is actually pathetic aren't they?! Banner for the Crows. Yeah we aren't the ones who never show up.
Your move, Crows fans.
