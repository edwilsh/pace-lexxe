  <title>Liberals set meeting on marriage change</title>
  <content>
A meeting of Liberal MPs has been scheduled for Monday to discuss same-sex marriage.
The special meeting comes as a small group of MPs is pushing for the coalition policy of a plebiscite to be dumped, and instead members be allowed a free vote on a private member's bill.
A joint party room meeting with the Nationals will still go ahead on Tuesday morning.
