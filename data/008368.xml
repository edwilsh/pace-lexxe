The best film in Cannes this year was also the work of the oldest film-maker in town - Agnes Vardaâ€‹, Nouvelle Vague legend, who was then about to turn 89 - working with hipster public artist JR, who is only 33 but clearly her soulmate.Photo: Supplied
The idea behind the film can be summed up in one line: the two artists travel around rural France, photographing the people they meet and turning these pictures into giant posters they then stick to the fronts of the houses, barns and bars where these people live and work.
Such a simple idea, but it yields such a bounty of human connections, stories and a sense of the richness of otherwise invisible working lives that it becomes profound.
It really feels as if all of life is here, ripe and rich - and you couldn't ask for two more convivial guides.
