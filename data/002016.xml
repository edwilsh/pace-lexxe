  <title>Brisbane bus drivers to strike again</title>
  <content>
Brisbane bus drivers will walk off the job for the fourth time in three weeks on Wednesday as an ongoing dispute over pay and safety continues with the council.
The Rail, Tram and Bus Union advised Brisbane City Council on Monday that "some" drivers would take industrial action between 10am and 2pm.
The council took to social media on Monday afternoon to urge commuters to plan ahead and make alternative arrangements.
