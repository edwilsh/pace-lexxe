  <title>US PGA Championship 2017: Australian contingent aims to bounce back</title>
  <content>
With the US PGA Championship kicking off this week, Adam Scott is confident of bouncing back from a lacklustre result at the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational.

Scott 's two-under-par 68 in the final round salvaged a respectable tie for 13th alongside world No.2 Jordan Spieth, but the world No.17 finished a distant 12 shots back of winner Hideki Matsuyama.

Scott ranked eighth in the field for driving distance with an average tee shot of 311.3 yards and tied for 31st for putting on greens reached in regulation.
But the Gold Coast native says other aspects of his game let him down in the final hit-out before the PGA Championship at North Carolina's Quail Hollow.

"I've got some work to do during the next few days, for sure. But the good thing is, I'm scoring well. If I can find the fairways and greens more often I'll be in good shape," Scott said.

Countrymen Hend and Day also experienced mixed results at the WGC-Bridgestone.
Townsville native Hend fired a third-round 63 to rocket into contention before fading away with a Sunday 73 to finish tied 10th at five under.
But 43-year-old Hend believes featuring high on the leaderboard and playing in Sunday's penultimate group with Matsuyama is good experience heading into the year's final major.
"I didn't make any putts, but it just wasn't my day," said Hend.
"But it's always good to play well at a good golf course and hopefully I can hole some more putts at the PGA."
World No.7 Day struggled on day four, his 71 sinking the Queenslander to two under for a share of 24th.
But the 29-year-old is inspired by seeing glimpses of his world-beating 2015 form, during which he won his maiden major title at the US PGA Championship among five Tour wins that took him to world No.1, in his third-round 66.
"My game is heading in the right direction, which is nice. I'm really happy with how I'm putting. It would be nice to finish the season a boom and call it a positive year," said Day.
Marc Leishman signed off with a respectable 69 to sit at three over tied for 41st, two shots ahead of countryman Sam Brazel in 47th (70, five-over).
Rod Pampling (80) slumped to a share of 74th at 19 over.
