  <title>Geelong plots high-stakes Danger appeal</title>
  <content>
GEELONG may launch an all-or-nothing appeal against the shock ban that has knocked Patrick Dangerfield out of contention for a consecutive Brownlow Medal.
The Cats superstar was yesterday charged with rough conduct and hit with a two-match suspension - reduced to one week with a guilty plea - for his heavy tackle that left Carlton ruck Matthew Kreuzer concussed.
Dangerfield faces a two-week stint on the sidelines should he elect to appeal at tonight's AFL tribunal and fail.
The Cats have until 11am today to decide whether to roll the dice.

JAY CLARK:
Dangerfield conceded the situation "is not ideal". "At the end of the day, we'll make a decision that's best for the team - not the individual - and what's best for the rest of our season," he said.
As soon as the penalty was announced, Richmond star Dustin Martin to win the Brownlow.
Geelong has engaged a Queen's Counsel to assess the likelihood of an appeal succeeding.
Former Cats captain Andrew Bews, who is father of Geelong player Jed, lashed the decision.
"Congratulations to the @AFL nanny state comp of the year," he wrote on Twitter.
"MRP a complete farce."
In challenging, Dangerfield would risk a fortnight suspension that would see him sidelined not only for this Friday night's clash with Sydney, but the team's Round 21 blockbuster against Richmond.

AFL: Patrick Dangerfield could find himself in hot water.

'FAIR TACKLE':
BROWNLOW:
Opinion among fans was divided with, as of 11.20pm last night, 53 per cent in the Herald Sun's poll saying the penalty was deserved. Before the weekend, the Cat was $1.80 favourite to go back-to-back in the Brownlow Medal.
After yesterday's decision, Richmond ace Dustin Martin became hot favourite to take out this year's award - which Dangerfield will have to present - rated a $1.18 chance with TAB, in from $2.25.
But Dangerfield was firm that the Brownlow Medal ramifications would have no bearing on whether he would appeal against the ban.
"It's the last thing on my mind," he said.
"What we're focused on is not only this week, but the remainder of the season and putting ourselves in a really strong position come the end of the year and come the start of the finals campaign. That's an important part of the decision that's to be made."
JON RALPH:
Kreuzer was concussed in the incident and played no further part in Saturday night's game after the tackle, in which his arms were pinned and he was brought to ground.
A medical report from the Blues was considered yesterday by the Match Review Panel - comprised of former players Jason Johnson, Nathan Burke and Michael Jamison.
The charge is Dangerfield's second in 196 games - he was fined $900 in 2012 for making negligent contact with an umpire.
