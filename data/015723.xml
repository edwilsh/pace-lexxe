  <title>Geelong could get Thessaloniki-inspired waterfront revamp under Coalition government</title>
  <content>
A recent taxpayer-funded trip to Greece has inspired the Victorian Opposition Leader's plans for a Hellenic makeover of Geelong's waterfront.

Matthew Guy has revealed plans to appoint a dedicated Minister for Geelong, develop a new metropolitan planning policy and order an Infrastructure Victoria audit of the region - if he wins next year's election.
He said he had been inspired by a 2009 redevelopment in the Greek city of Thessaloniki that included waterfront cycling paths and gardens to complement the night life.
"I'd like to see Geelong's waterfront change and grow substantially," he said.
"I've just come back from Thessaloniki, Greece's second-largest city, where we've seen huge change on that waterfront and it's fantastic, it looks magnificent, we can do this in Geelong."

Mr Guy said revitalising the city's north-facing waterfront on Corio Bay would be a huge jobs boost for the region.

Thessaloniki facts

Second largest city and commercial port in Greece
Known as the 'most erotic city in Greece'
Has a Mediterranean climate, approximately 300 days of sunshine per year
New seafront includes walking, cycling paths, The White Tower and the statue of Alexander the Great on horseback
Population over 878,000

"Geelong's got huge opportunity. Let's not waste it, let's not sit on our hands, let's be proactive and do something positive for this city," he said.
The publisher of Greek-Australian newspaper Neos Kosmos, Chris Gogos, said he could see the merit in a plan for Geelong inspired by the Thessaloniki development.
"What they've done there is amazing, it's incredible," he said.
"There's a whole restaurant scene, a bar scene, and a whole lot of money went into it."
Mr Guy said the Liberal MP for South Barwon, Andrew Katos, would be made the Minister for Geelong.
"You've got to have someone at the cabinet table fighting for the city," he said.
