  <title>Real estate agents at the forefront of change</title>
  <content>
THE local branch of the REIQ was one of the driving forces behind the naming of the Sunshine Coast but even its most imaginative members could hardly have thought how much their industry would change over the next five decades.
Of course, the value of property was always going to increase in the long term but did any of them forsee land behind the sand dunes of Kawana one day being home to tens of thousands of people or the sleepy main street of Noosa becoming known worldwide as a cosmopolitan destination?
People like Nev Kane, who was involved in those early REIQ meetings and is still in business at 85 years of age, has watched the real estate world change dramatically.
Mobile phones have replaced the two-way radios once used by the most progressive agents  and where business was once generated mostly by window displays and newspaper advertising, now it's a world of websites and apps.
The Henzell family has been at the forefront since 1935 when Caloundra was little more than a sleepy fishing village and even Brett Graham, who opened his own agency as recently as 1999, has seen fortunes fluctuate and the same block of land fetch as much as $450,000 and as little as $85,000 in the space of just a few years.
This book does not pretend to be "the ultimate history of real estate on the Sunshine Coast" but, rather, a snapshot of the past 50 years through the eyes of people like Nev Kane, Brett Graham, the Henzells and Vicky Stewart, who began selling property because she was a single mum who needed a "family friendly" job and now owns her own business.
They will tell you that the real estate game is full of highs and lows but it's a roller-coaster ride none of them can imagine getting off.
