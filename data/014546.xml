  <content>
A gas tanker has caught fire on southeast Queensland's M1 motorway, sending thick black smoke billowing across the nearby area.
A spokesman for Queensland Fire Service said the medium-sized tanker is well alight and four fire crews are rushing to the scene.
A scientific officer has been sent to assess the risk posed by the chemical incident.
Queensland Police are diverting traffic off at the Bryan Road Exit and are clearing nearby businesses as an added precaution.
