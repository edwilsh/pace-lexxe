  <title>Wolfe pack on the move</title>

TASMANIA'S favourite band of brothers are ready to hit the road on what is set to be a year-long jaunt around the country.
Country rockers , which is set to kick off in September and includes gigs in Hobart, Burnie, Launceston, Queenstown, and Melton.
The Let's Hit The Road -  Australian Tour will continue around Australia until June next year.
The band has recently been in Nashville writing songs for their next album ahead of a planned new album to be released in mid-2018.
Lead singer Nick Wolfe said every night on tour would be different.
"We are trying to evolve as a band. We do not want to stay the same all the time, we want to grow and get better at what we do," Wolfe said.
"Our goal is to achieve this on the new tour by giving the audience all the hit songs with some nostalgic covers but also share some new music with them before we release these songs on [the] next album."
