CONFUSION reigns over the AFL's tackling rules, but Mark Robinson has told the SuperFooty Podcast he believes Brodie Grundy had to know he was putting Ben Brown in harm's way in his bone-jarring tackle.
Robbo joined Lauren Wood, Anthony Hudson and Mick Warner to tackle the AFL's tackling issue and said the league needs to provide more clarity to end the confusion of clubs, coaches, fans and players.

BAROMETER:
THE TACKLE:
Brown was taken to hospital after hitting his head on the ground in a Grundy tackle during the North Melbourne's loss to Collingwood on Saturday night.
"I thought on the weekend, Brodie Grundy held him (Brown), two actions, and slammed him into the ground and he didn't let go, so he couldn't protect himself," Robbo said.
"I thought it was two actions, I thought it was worse than Patrick Dangerfield's.
"(Collingwood coach) Nathan Buckley said it was the perfect tackle and as soon as he said it I think everyone said "no, it's not, we can't have perfect tackles with people getting knocked out'."

BEST SLEDGES:
Grundy was remorseful in his interview after the game, but Robbo says that doesn't change the action.
"Brodie Grundy's got to be held responsible for that," Robbo said.
"Everyone's going 'I feel sorry for Brodie Grundy'.
"I don't feel sorry for him.
"He knew what he was doing, it was unlucky that he got concussed, but he had to know he was putting the opponent in a dangerous situation."
