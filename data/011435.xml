  <title>Top program for Jabiru's Mahbilil Fest</title>
  <content>
NOT all the festivals in August are in the heart of Darwin - the Mahbilil Festival cultural festival in Jabiru has announced a vibrant program.
Mahbilil Festival producer Scott Large said the program showcased some of the best Territory talent.
"There will be an incredible selection of bands from across the Top End with hand-picked acts from Darwin and around the country," he said.
"Workshops will include traditional arts and craft such as spear-making, pandanus weaving and local storytelling.
Musical acts include Oka, Tijuana Cartel and Black Rock Band and there's plenty of other activities including dance, circus and food.
"One of the highlights of the festival for many is the local dance program with the Jabiru Bininj Gunborrk dancers set to light up the dance ground once again," Mr Large said.
"This all sits alongside a full program of bushfood preparation and cooking both on the coals and in a traditional ground-oven."
