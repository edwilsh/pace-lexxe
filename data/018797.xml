  <title>US Marine Corps aircraft crew missing off Queensland coast after 'mishap'</title>
  <content>
A major search and rescue operation is underway off the coast of Queensland for the crew of a United States Marine Corps (USMC) aircraft.
The US Military confirmed one of its MV-22 Ospreys was involved in a "mishap" off the east coast.
The tilt-rotor aircraft had been in Queensland as part of .
The exercises were taking place in Shoalwater Bay training area near Rockhampton in Central Queensland.
Defence Minister Marise Payne said no Australian Defence Force personnel were on board the aircraft.
"The United States are leading the search and recovery effort," she wrote in a statement.
"I have briefed Prime Minister Turnbull and spoken with Secretary [of Defence James] Mattis this evening to offer Australia's support in anyway that can be of assistance.
"Our thoughts are with the crew and families affected."
MV-22 aircraft, known as Ospreys, have a somewhat checkered history, with a number of the helicopter-plane hybrids going down recently.
In December, five crewmembers of an Osprey had to be rescued after their craft conducted a shallow-water landing off Okinawa after a training mishap in which a rotor blade cut a refuelling hose, according to the Marine Expeditionary Force.
During a US counter-terrorism operation in Yemen, two soldiers were reportedly injured when a USMC MV-22 experienced a "hard landing" after being called in to evacuate injured troops.
