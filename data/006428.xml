  <title>Stink over prawn farmer loan deal</title>
  <content>
A STATE government offer of low-interest loans to Albert and Logan river prawn farmers hit by white spot disease has been slammed by the fisheries industry.
The loans are only for prawn farmers in the catchments and not trawler operators or live bait suppliers.
State Agriculture minister Bill Byrne said the prawn farmers could apply for up to $3 million in low-interest loans to "aid recovery".
Queensland Seafood Industry Association chief executive Eric Perez said the loans was a "token gesture" and did not help his members who had also suffered. The announcement came as trawler operators and live bait suppliers pleaded for a "level playing field" after the Federal Government dropped a ban on raw prawn imports.
