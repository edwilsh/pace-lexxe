  <title>Va fails to have blue card overturned</title>

NEWCASTLE and Hunter Rugby Union general manager Andy Fairfull said it was imperative that every precaution be taken with players who receive head knocks after Southern Beaches captain Va Talaileva was unsuccessful in having a blue card overturned.

Referee Brendan Farrar issued Talaileva a blue card for concussion after the No.8 was hit heavy in a tackle late in the Beaches' 33-31 loss to the Waratahs last Saturday.
Players who receive a blue card are not allowed to play or train for 12 days.

Talaileva insisted that he had not been concussed and followed ARU protocols in a bid to have the card overturned.

The 35-year-old was cleared of concussion on Monday by a sports doctor. He was then referred to ARU concussion specialist, Newcastle neurologist, Dr Andrew Gardner and underwent a further series of cognitive tests. However Dr Gardner, who also took into account reports from the referee and physiotherapist, determined that the blue card should stand.

As a result, Talaileva will sit out Beaches' clash against Wanderers at Alan Davis Field on Saturday.

"It is better to be safe than sorry," Fairfull said. "Although the doctor agreed that Va didn't show signs of concussion 50 hours after receiving the knock, he also looked at a video of the incident and took into account a report from the physio and referee. The physio believed there were signs of concussion in the first minute that Va was on the ground. In all of this player welfare is paramount."

Talaileva maintains he "was not knocked out" but agrees a week off will be beneficial.

"They are pretty strict with it and decided to err on the side of caution," Talaileva said. "I'll have the week off and be ready for Hamilton."

If Talaileva receives another blue card in the next year, he is deemed to be susceptible to concussion and is referred to the ARU for a special review and management plan.

As well as Talaileva, Beaches are without breakaway Marlon Solofuti (overseas). Tim Poese moves from prop to No.8 and Mitch Gibson comes in on the side.
"I'm confident the boys will do the job," Talaileva said. "Tim is a strong ball runner and has younger legs than me. It will be a good test for us."

Beaches' loss to an under-manned Tahs has loosened their grip on third place. Maitland are nine points adrift in fourth but have an easier run home.

With the inaugural Tony Wansey shield up for grabs, Wanderers coach Viv Paasi expects the home side to lift.
"We haven't read into the result from last weekend. They will definitely lift and are always good at home," he said. "It will be decided at the set piece and ruck battle."

Elsewhere, Lake Macquarie welcome back five players for the visit by unbeaten leaders Hamilton, Merewether will be out to continue their push for the top five at home against University, Nelson Bay face a tough trip to Maitland and Waratahs host Singleton.
