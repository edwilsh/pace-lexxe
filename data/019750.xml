  <title>Hail as winter storms sweep state</title>
  <content>
PARTS of the Sunshine Coast have been pelted by hail this afternoon as a rare August storm sweeps through central and southeast Queensland.
The Bureau of Meteorology says once the storm clears the Ekka westerlies will kick in.
Meteorologist David Grant said the storm was likely to stay north and west of Brisbane, but wild weather can't be ruled out further afield tonight.
The Sunshine Coast has felt the most impact, with small hail reported and rains of between 15mm to 25mm, and isolated heavy falls of up to 75mm in the Wide Bay region.
"It's not very common to have thunderstorm activity as widespread as this in August," Mr Grant said.
"August is quite noted for its dry westerly winds."
The upper trough and Coral Sea moisture combo will move off the east coast tomorrow and be replaced by a dry westerly stream, better known as the Ekka westerlies.
There is slight chance of shower in Brisbane tomorrow morning with a top forecasted temperature of 25C.
The minimum temperature will drop through the week, hitting a low of 6C on Wednesday in the city.
