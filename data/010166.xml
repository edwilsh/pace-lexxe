A MAN and young girl have been killed after a plane made an emergency landing on a beach in Portugal while the pilot was having a flying lesson.
The victims, aged 56 and eight, were sunbathing on Sao Joao beach near Lisbon when the horror unfolded.
It was earlier reported the victims were a mum and her child, but they have now been confirmed as a man and child, who are not believed to be related,
Police chief Paulo Isabel confirmed the two men on board the plane, an instructor and his pupil, had been arrested and were being questioned.
Maritime Police Chief Pedro Coelho Dias, confirming the two deaths, said: "The victims are a man and an eight-year-old girl.
"They were hit by the plane and died at the scene."
Tragedy struck earlier today on a stretch of coastline known as Costa da Caparica - a short drive from Jose Mourinho's home city of Setubal.
Tourists had been sunbathing on the beach when the plane - described as a light aircraft - was forced to land.
