  <content>
A would-be burglar found himself trapped between two buildings in Melbourne when his criminal intentions went awry.
The man had to be freed from his makeshift prison by emergency services at suburban Deer Park on Monday afternoon after an alleged burglary on Sunday.
The man has since been arrested but not charged.
