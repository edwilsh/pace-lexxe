  <title>Cricket pay war is finally over</title>
  <content>
CRICKET has finally signed off on a new landmark pay deal, ending a bitter and drawn-out saga that's lasted nearly 10 months.
The Ashes has been saved and Steve Smith will lead his team to Bangladesh later this month for two Tests.
Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers' Association came to an agreement on key issues early in the week but the process of signing off on the deal has taken longer than expected, with both parties going back and forth over wordings and minor matters.
Originally it was hoped there would be announcement on Tuesday or Wednesday.
It's expected CA chief executive James Sutherland and his ACA counterpart Alistair Nicholson will hold a press conference in Melbourne at 4.30pm.
The anticipation is that players have retained a revenue share model, even if it has been heavily modernised to give CA more financial stability.
Grassroots and back pay are the other key points in the agreement.
Players who have been uncontracted for a over a month will now be paid again.
