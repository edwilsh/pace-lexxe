London: Manchester United have signed Serbia international Nemanja Matic from Premier League champions Chelsea on three-year contract with an option to extend for a further year, both clubs said on Monday.
Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but British media reported that United paid between £40 million ($65.7 million) and £50 million ($82.3 million)to reunite the 28-year-old midfielder with manager Jose Mourinho.Photo: Brendan Esposito
"Nemanja is a Manchester United player and a Jose Mourinho player. He represents everything we want in a footballer; loyalty, consistency, ambition, team player," Mourinho said in a statement.
"I would like to thank him for his desire to join us because without that, it would be impossible to have him here. I am sure our players and supporters will love him. A big welcome to our new number 31."

Mourinho signed Matic when he was in charge of Chelsea in 2014. Matic, who originally joined Chelsea in 2009 before moving to Benfica in 2011, became an influential part of Chelsea's title-winning side under Mourinho in 2014-15.
Also on Monday, United and two of their players were been fined by UEFA after they failed to comply with anti-doping regulations, European soccer's governing body said.

Defenders Daley Blind and England international Phil Jones were been fined €5,000 euros ($7,300) each and the club were handed a €10,000 ($14,600) sanction for offences occurring at the Europa League final against Ajax Amsterdam in Stockholm on May 24.
Jones, who UEFA said used "insulting and directing abusive language towards the Doping Control Officer" has also been suspended for two UEFA matches and will miss the Super Cup match against Real Madrid on August 8 and the opening Champions League game.
UEFA said the incidents breached the regulation which states that teams are responsible for ensuring that players selected to undergo doping controls are taken to the control station straight from the pitch as soon as the match is over.
United, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, can appeal against the decision.
