  <title>"Vote one Malley!"</title>
  <content>
Alex, we admit it! We are hopelessly addicted to news of former CPA CEO Alex Malley here at Rear Window. And we'd normally be loath to admit it, but we're not sure what else to do. You see, he's been cutting us off. And not only us: the Naked CEO won't even speak to our colleagues now, so we can't even get our Malley dose vicariously! Thankfully, there's still Chris Smith, who has Malley on once a week for his "Smithy's Deplorables" segment on 4BC Brisbane.
Last Friday, Malley told Smith how he'd earlier told Edmund Tadros, this paper's delightful accounting and consulting editor, to "get a life". And all because Tadros asked to speak to him for a tick-tock feature about Malley's final hours at CPA. Tadros' response was: "Does that mean no?" "Yes it does", Mally said on air. "Yes it does."
Sorry Ed, it's probably our fault.  
But onto other things here at Malley central. The Friday before last, Malley told Smith he'd had a "couple of calls" from politicians in recent days. This was, of course, when MPs were dropping left, right and centre due to their dual citizenships. 

"Even though I am ethnically heritaged, I can confirm to both parties I'm clean and fresh," the Naked CEO said. "Vote one Malley!"

Please do - we're getting withdrawal symptoms over here!
