  <title>Trial over Vic racing cobalt leak findings</title>
  <content>
Former Racing Victoria chairman David Moodie wants a judge to overturn the racing integrity commissioner's finding that he inappropriately disclosed information about a cobalt investigation.
Commissioner Sal Perna determined Mr Moodie was not the original source of a leak about positive cobalt results for two trainers but found he compromised the investigation by disclosing the information.
Mr Moodie is seeking to have Mr Perna's findings quashed by the Victorian Supreme Court in a trial scheduled to begin on Monday.
In a writ filed in February, Mr Moodie accused the racing integrity commissioner of acting unfairly.
Mr Perna found Mr Moodie, then a RV board member, inappropriately told trainer Peter Moody in January 2015 about positive cobalt swabs for horses trained by Mark Kavanagh and Danny O'Brien, therefore compromising the integrity of the investigation.
His December 2016 report also found Mr Moodie misled the Racing Victoria Integrity Council and the RV board about what he told Mr Moody, who trained horses for him.
The writ alleged the commissioner ought to have found Mr Moodie was merely passing on an unsubstantiated rumour without identifying the other trainers' names and that his conduct could not have had a detrimental effect on RV's cobalt investigation.
