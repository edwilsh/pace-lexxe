David Swallow is a late out for Suns

GOLD Coast's challenging assignment notching a rare win in Perth just got tougher after midfielder David Swallow was ruled out of Saturday night's clash against Fremantle.

Swallow flew to Perth but has a tight groin and has been replaced by Jarrad Grant.

It will be Grant's first match this season. He played 13 times for the Suns last year after being delisted by the Western Bulldogs.

Superstar midfielder Gary Ablett will take his place for his first match away from Metricon Stadium since round 12.

The Dockers will go in unchanged and are aiming to break a four-game losing streak at home.

Gold Coast has won only once in nine trips to Domain Stadium, a 26-point triumph in round two last year.
