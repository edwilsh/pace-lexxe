  <title>Meagher seeks a more stable base</title>
  <content>
MELBOURNE Cup-winning trainer John Meagher has opened a satellite stable in Victoria as the long-term future of his Eagle Farm stable remains up in the air.
Meagher, who will turn 70 next month, already has his Group 2 and 3 winner Savanna Amour in Melbourne for her tilt at next month's $1 million Memsie Stakes at Caulfield.
She will be joined by stakes-placed mare Cruising Speed in coming weeks at his Victorian base on the Mornington Peninsula.
Meagher, trainer of the 1985 Melbourne Cup winner What A Nuisance, has had a Brisbane base since 2012, when he set up with sons Dan and Chris. Dan has since set up a stable in Singapore and this year Chris returned to lend a hand, with his brother's stable growing rapidly.
Meagher said in the short term he still intended to run a team of "20 or so" from his Eagle Farm base but with the prizemoney discrepancy between Queensland and Victoria it had become increasingly difficult to attract owners to race in Brisbane.
"They pay back to 10th in Victoria now, which makes it very attractive to race horses down here," he said.
With Meagher now sharing his time between Mornington and Eagle Farm, Chris is expected to come back from Singapore to manage the Brisbane arm of the stable.
Savanna Amour is scheduled to race in Sunday's rescheduled Bletchingly Stakes at Sandown as she gears up for the Memsie Stakes.
"She had a lovely gallop here (Wednesday) and she's done really well since arriving," Meagher said. "She's the only mare in the race. She just needs to draw a good gate now and I'm sure she will be running on strongly at the end."
â–  GROUP 1-winning jockey Darryl McLellan has taken the first steps to a return to the saddle after piloting Sugarparma to a barrier trial win for Toby Edmonds this week.
McLellan, 45, has not ridden since a fall at Newcastle in 2011.
Chief steward Allan Reardon indicated McLellan would be granted a licence to ride in races when his weight comes down.
Edmonds has stated he intends to use the jockey, in the first instance, at provincial meetings.
