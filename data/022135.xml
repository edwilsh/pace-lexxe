  <title>Everblu Capital hires corporate finance executive </title>
  <content>
Boutique advisory firm Everblu has hired Palladion Partners' Andrew Bald for its corporate finance team. 
Street Talk understands Bald is due to start in the new role this week.
He was most recently a managing director at Palladion Partners, a position he held for four years. Prior to that he was chief executive of ASX-listed Burleson Energy and had a stint at ABN Amro in structured derivatives. 
Everblu is based in Sydney and Israel. 

The firm jointly worked on last week's capital raising for  subscription software company LiveTiles with Blue Ocean Equities.
