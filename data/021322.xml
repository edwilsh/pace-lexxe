  <title>Thanasi Kokkinakis goes from sore to soaring</title>
  <content>
TENNIS: He may have missed claiming the title in his first ATP final but Australian Thanasi Kokkinakis will receive a huge win in the rankings.
The 21-year-old will soar over 200 places after losing to world No.24 and Wimbledon semi-finalist Sam Querrey 6-3 3-6 6-2 in Los Cabos, Mexico.
Having contested just his sixth tournament after missing 18 months due to a spate of injuries, Kokkinakis is expected to jump from No.454 in the world to No.225.
"For me this has been unbelievable," an emotional Kokkinakis said. "In two years I have missed so much time.
"I was sitting on the couch doing nothing for two years and now to come back and play at this level and have such a great tournament; what better place to do it than Los Cabos."
Kokkinakis had defeated top seed and world No.14 Tomas Berdych to reach the final.
