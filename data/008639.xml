  <title>'Slap in the face' as Immigration bosses get pay rise</title>
  <content>
Bosses at the Immigration Department will get a second pay rise inside eight months while a freeze on salary growth remains for rank-and-file workers locked in a marathon bargaining dispute.

Main public service union the CPSU condemned the move and called it a slap in the face for workers at the department embroiled in a four-year dispute over pay and conditions.
Comment was sought from the DIBP.
CPSU Deputy National President Rupert Evans said the department was trying to strip rights, conditions and pay for front-line workers but freely awarded pay rises to those at the top.
"These two no-strings attached pay rises - 4 per cent in eight months - clearly show there's one set of rules for senior executives and another set for staff working on average or below average wages while struggling to keep up with their mortgage payments and living costs," he said.

"Secretary Mike Pezzullo's email to advise senior executives of their good fortune says they deserve a pay rise for the department's achievements - such as issuing millions of visas and seizing drugs, guns and other contraband - yet the people who've actually carried out this work continue to get nothing.
"This frustrating and unfair situation in DIBP is in marked contrast to the bargaining progress that's been made in the rest of the Commonwealth public sector in 2017, as bosses have recognised that retaining existing rights and conditions is the key issue for their staff."

Long-running bargaining disputes starting as the Coalition imposed a hardline industrial policy have settled at the Australian Tax Office, and the Defence and Agriculture departments following yes votes in recent months.
But the dispute at Immigration has been taken out of the hands of departmental bosses and is now subject to a lengthy arbitration process at the Fair Work Commission.
