  <title>Ausgrid lands record US debt deal</title>
  <content>
Ausgrid has made a successful debut in United States debt markets, closing the books on the biggest ever deal by an Australian issuer into the US privately issued debt market. 
Sources said Ausgrid raised the $2 billion it was after, including more than $US1.6 billion in the US Private Placement market, to refinance a bridge loan in full. 
It is understood to be the biggest deal ever by an Australian issuer to USPP investors. 
Funds raised were to refinance Ausgrid's $2 billion bridge loan, taken out when IFM Investors and AustralianSuper bought into the electricity distributor last year as part of a wider $12 billion debt package.

It was Ausgrid's first time in front of US debt investors. 

UBS advised Ausgrid, while the deal's bookrunners were Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and National Australia Bank. 

The raising comes only a fortnight after fellow NSW electricity infrastructure company TransGrid tapped the United States Private Placement market for a combination of 10-year, 12-year and 15-year debt worth $US727 million.
