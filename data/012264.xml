  <title>Healy and Vigar combination strike again</title>
  <content>
KYM Healy and Raymond Vigar have combined to win another Cup.
Both had cause for celebration when five-year-old gelding Aussie Jack took out the $35,000 Darwin Corporate Cup (1300m) at Fannie Bay yesterday.
Starting at the juicy odds of $12 against respectable 0-76 opposition, Aussie Jack left it late before taking out the feature race on Day 6 of the Darwin Cup Carnival.
For Healy, the win certainly lifted his spirits after spending five days in Darwin hospital following appendix surgery last Thursday.
And for Vigar, who won the Darwin Cup last year on board Canny Ballad, victory made it a double for the day after saluting in the previous race on Heart Of Red for Alice Springs trainer Terry Gillett.
In recent times, Healy and Vigar have celebrated success with Pretty Blonde in the 2016 Broome Cup (2200m) and 2017 Alice Springs Cup (2000m).
Jumping from the inside gate, Aussie Jack settled midfield along the rails before making his move once turning for home.
By that stage, Greg Connor's Iceflow (Stephen Ridler) from Alice Springs had shaken off Kerry Petrick's Poet's Choice (Felicia Bergstrand) and Gary Clarke's $2.30 favourite One Faster (Brendon Davis) and looked set to secure a deserved victory.
Connor's hopes of winning the Darwin Corporate Cup for a second straight year following Le Commandant's triumph in 2016 were dashed when Aussie Jack arrived in time to pip Iceflow by a short half head in a thrilling finish.
The back-markers certainly found their feet in the home straight with Neil Dyer's Rakitiki (Jason Lyon) grabbing third place ahead of stablemate Pot Black (Jarrod Todd) and Danny Penna's Moonlight Hussler (Richie Oakford).
Healy, from Strathalbyn, who won earlier in the day with Wicked Promise, was trackside yesterday, but he was moving very gingerly.
"It's been a good day and for Aussie Jack to win second up was a good effort - he'll be backing up over 1600m on Monday," Healy said.
For Vigar, who hadn't tasted victory since booting home Neil Dyer's Arctic Song in the opening race on Day 1 of the Darwin Cup Carnival on July 8, it was a first-class ride.
"I needed a bit of luck after going forward and settling on the rails. but once a decent gap appeared at the top of the straight I thought I was a chance,' he said. "I put the stick away and ended up riding him hands and heels - he finished strongly over the final 200m."

Aussie Jack, who finished second on his Darwin debut behind He's Our Woody over 1100m on July 22, was subjected to a veterinary inspection prior to the race before being passed fit to run.
"I must thank Philip Cole and his wife Rhonda, and the rest of their staff, for looking after my horses - there are seven in total - while I was in hospital," Healy said.
Rakitiki, a last start winner along with Iceflow and Pot Black, was probably the unlucky runner in the race after getting squeezed at the start.
One Faster had his chances, but faded in the home straight to finish seventh.
