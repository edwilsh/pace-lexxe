One of Wollongong's "most sought-after A-grade office buildings" is up for sale.

Located at 43 Burelli Street, the property, 'Corporate Square', comprises 9688sqm lettable office space and 92 car parking spaces.

According to selling agent Knight Frank, it boasts 98.7 per cent occupancy, and the building offers investors a secure net passing income of about $3.4 million per annum, with a tenancy profile made up of about 73 per cent Commonwealth and state government tenants.

Knight Frank's director Institutional Sales Tyler Talbot said strong interest in the property is expected as investors turn their attention to assets outside of Sydney's CBD due to tight yields in Sydney.

"Corporate Square is well-recognised as one of Wollongong's most sought-after A-grade office buildings," he said. 
Knight Frank's managing director Illawarra Ben Mostyn said demand for quality office space in Wollongong is strengthening.
"Over the past 18 months, there has been a strong growth in the demand for A-grade offices across the market with a pickup in tenant demand stemming from both business expansions and new market entries." 
Mr Mostyn claimed Wollongong is now one of the top office markets in Australia, outperforming Canberra, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Darwin CBDs in terms of a low vacancy rate.
