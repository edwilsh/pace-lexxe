  <title>Roberts docs to be released: Hanson</title>
  <content>
Senator Malcolm Roberts will table documents he says prove he was not a British citizen at the time of last year's election, Pauline Hanson says.
The One Nation leader told ABC Radio on Thursday that Mr Roberts had her full support and would table documents proving he had renounced his citizenship in the Senate next week.
"He has not done anything illegal here, he was in compliance with the Constitution," she said.
