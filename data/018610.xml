  <title>Student pilot dies in hospital after plane crash in Melbourne</title>
  <content>
A teenaged student pilot has died in hospital two days after the plane he was flying with an instructor plunged to the ground in Melbourne.  
Hong Kong national Nicholas Cheung, 19, suffered face, chest and spinal injuries in the crash. He remained trapped in the wreckage for hours before being freed and taken to hospital.
Pilot John Dwyer, who was also critically injured in the crash, remains in the Royal Melbourne Hospital.  
Emergency crews were called to Pound Road in Clyde North just after 10.30am on Thursday after witnesses reported seeing smoke come from the plane.
Witnesses said it appeared the pilot was looking for a place to land, before signalling a mayday call and crashing into a paddock.
The Bristol single-engine aircraft was operated out of Moorabbin by Learn to Fly Melbourne.
The company told 9NEWS the team is "devastated and shocked" by the crash.
