  <title>NSW teacher jailed for sex with students</title>
  <content>
A bisexual Sydney high school teacher who had sex with three teenage students has been jailed for at least six years.
Parramatta District Court judge James Bennett on Wednesday said Cameron White had abused his position as a teacher to exploit the vulnerable, naive students for his own sexual gratification.
White, 39, was found guilty by a jury in May of 14 counts of aggravated sexual assault and five counts of sexual intercourse with a person under care involving two female students and one male student.
