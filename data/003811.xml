  <title>Patrick Dangerfield out of Brownlow Medal contention after accepting AFL ban</title>

Patrick Dangerfield's hopes of claiming a second consecutive Brownlow Medal have been dashed after he accepted a one-match ban for a dangerous tackle.
Dangerfield had been seeking to become the first back-to-back winner of the Brownlow Medal since Robert Harvey (1997, 1998), but he is out of contention following his tackle on Carlton's Matthew Kreuzer during Saturday night's match at Docklands.
"After seeking independent advice, the club has decided to accept the penalty handed down to Pat by the match review panel," Geelong's general manager of football Steve Hocking said in a statement.
"The club reviewed all possibilities around the case in coming to this decision. We respect the fact that the match review panel has a challenging and difficult role and has to operate under high scrutiny.
"While there has been a lot of debate around Pat's eligibility for the Brownlow Medal, Pat and the club have at all times remained focussed on what is best for the team as we head towards to last part of the season."

Dangerfield had tackled Kreuzer to the ground without the ball, at which point the Blues ruckman hit his head on the ground.
Kreuzer left the field concussed and did not return to the match and the incident was later classed by the AFL match review panel as "careless conduct with medium impact to the head".
Dangerfield had risked a two-match suspension had he contested the charge at the tribunal.
His early guilty plea means he will miss the Cats' Friday night match against Sydney at Kardinia Park.
More to come.
