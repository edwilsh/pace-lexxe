  <title>Man arrested after alleged assault in front of police officers playing netball</title>
  <content>
An Auckland man chose the wrong time and place to pick a fight - under the noses of police officers playing netball.
Constable Laura Hadwen was enjoying an afternoon of seven-a-side netball with her colleagues from the force on Auckland's North Harbour when they noticed "something going on" between a group of men on July 22.Photo: Waitemata Police
The teammates ducked out of their game to arrest a 31-year-old man.
"None of us said anything to each other," Constable Hadwen said.
"I didn't even look at the other girls again, but I think we pretty much came to the same decision at the same time.
"We just ran over and pulled everyone apart and tried to get control of the main offender.

"It was kind of surreal," she added.
The man has been charged with aggravated assault, assault with intent to injure and common assault.

Five of the seven players in the netball team are police officers, some with more than 10 years' experience on the force.
Constable Hadwen said the man who was arrested was "quite aggressive" and loudly accused another person of grabbing him.
"Most of the people down at the courts don't know who we are or what we do," she said.
"We're not called the Police Team or anything like that.
"I believe he was a random person near the court, riding his bike, and he was told to get off his bike by one of the Netball North Harbour staff.
"It was just his bad luck as to where it occurred."
The game didn't stop for Constable Hadwen and her teammates. 
Social games are on a preset time buzzer so, after her team took a few minutes subduing and arresting the man, members of the public kept an eye on him until their team could finish the game.
"We have sort of had a laugh about it, the coincidence of it."
Constable Hadwen's team went on to win their match 40-34.
