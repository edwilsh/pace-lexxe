Descendants of workers who took part in one of Australia's largest industrial conflicts have marked the 100-year anniversary since many workers from all around the country walked off the job.
In August 1917 close to 100,000 people went on strike for six weeks, in a dispute sparked by the introduction of a card system designed to monitor a worker's efficiency.
When Sydney railway and tramway workers from the Eveleigh railway workshops and Randwick tram sheds walked off they job they triggered the Great Strike.
Against the backdrop of WWI, the strike's impact was felt for years to come.

Today Nyree Dietrichday attended an exhibition on the Great Strike at the Carriageworks in Sydney.
Her great-grandfather William Manning, a train driver, was awarded a white lily medallion by the union movement for striking for the entire six weeks.
"One of my great-grandfathers was an ANZAC and another participated in the Great Strike in Sydney," she said.

"It's part of Sydney's history. As the war was being fought overseas, people at home had their own war to fight."
The strike took its toll on workers. One striker was shot dead and many workers lost their jobs or were demoted when the campaign collapsed.

"According to his railway records after the six-week strike his pay dropped," Ms Dietrich said.
Exhibition curator Nina Miall said there are photographs from the time but until now film was hard to come by.
A documentary on the strike was shown once in public at the time then it was suppressed.
"We have uncovered two fragments of the film and they are on show for the first time in 100 years, " Ms Miall said.
"It gives a sense of the scale. There were these extraordinary street processions.
"The strike was a failure. The time card system they were striking against was introduced.
"It did [however] create a whole generation of future politicians. It galvanised community networks. It shaped the political consciousness of a raft of people who went on to become future premiers and prime ministers."
The free exhibition brings together historical objects such as union banners, badges and certificates, archival photographs, film and oral testimonies alongside commissioned artworks.
