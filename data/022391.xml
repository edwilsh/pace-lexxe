  <title>Qld man charged over dodgy caravan sales</title>
  <content>
A Brisbane man who allegedly sold written-off caravans will face court later this month charged with 81 separate offences.
The 65-year-old from Manly West is accused of buying caravans from NSW that had been irreparably damaged by hail, flood and impact, transporting them to Queensland and on selling them.
Drug and Serious Crime Group Detective Inspector Lance Vercoe said customers who bought one of the vehicles could apply for compensation through the Office of Fair Trading.
