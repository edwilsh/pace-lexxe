  <title>Is this the best rugby try of the year?</title>
  <content>
AUSTRALIA'S Super Rugby sides failed to deliver the thrills fans had hoped for this year, but Sydney's club players are taking entertainment to new heights with spectacular tries.
Highlighted by these two beauties by Gordon against Penrith and Northern Suburbs, the Shute Shield has become a haven for brilliant running rugby and is attracting a legion of spectators who've turned their backs on the disappointing professional ranks.
In a year where every Australian Super team had a losing season, and the Waratahs produced one of their worst seasons in history, the Shute Shield has become a beacon of light for disaffected rugby fans.
And as the finals series approaches, the pressure is on for teams to better the tries already scored in 2017.
Club rugby spectators have been astonished by the incredible long-range efforts that have already been produced by teams this season - some of the best tries seen anywhere in the world.
But with one round remaining and key finals spots up for grabs there is an expectation that rather than teams going into their shells, they will ramp their attacking audacity, highlighted by the fact that the top six teams have been averaging between 31 to 40 points per game.
Saturday will decide the final placings of each team and therefore who hosts playoff the following week.
Second-placed Randwick host third-placed Southern Districts - who are on an eight-match winning streak - while defending champions Norths are at home to Warringah in the most decisive games.
Unless the winless Penrith produce a major upset against Eastwood, the top six should remain in place and that would mean perennial finalists Sydney University missing out on the playoffs altogether.
Ladder leaders Manly have already claimed the minor premiership and face West Harbour at Concord.
The qualifying finals will be held on the following weekend of August 12-13, with first hosting sixth, second hosting fifth, and third hosting fourth.
