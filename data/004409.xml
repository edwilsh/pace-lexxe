  <title>Dead whale on popular Gold Coast beach</title>
  <content>
A DEAD baby whale has washed up on shore between Nobbys and Main Beach this morning.

The carcass was found just before 11am this morning and it is believed council animal management will remove the whale.

Sea World marine sciences director Trevor Long said about 20 per cent of baby whales were lost each year "for a range of reasons."

A baby whale carcass being eaten buy a tiger shark 4km off the Gold Coast Seaway last week.

He said having not seen the baby whale he couldn't assess why it had died.

Mr Long also said whale populations were increasing each year by about 3000 animals.

Last week a baby whale carcass was found outside the Seaway being eaten by a tiger shark.
