  <title>Helicopter pilot gets too close to the ground during air show</title>
  <content>
An air show in Belarus almost ended in disaster after a helicopter's rear rotor skimmed the ground during a wild manoeuvre.

Classical music blared across a grassy field in Minsk last week as an armoured Mil Mi-2 helicopter cruised through the sky.

The helicopter performed several swoops, coming within centimetres of the ground, before soaring back into the sky.

During one of the passes, the pilot dived too low causing the choppers rear rotor to graze the ground, sending grass and dirt flying into the sky.

The incident didn't appear to cause any damage to the aircraft as the pilot continued the routine.
