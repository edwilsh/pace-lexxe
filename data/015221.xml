A 52-year old man has been charged with a string of drug offences and had his assets frozen after a raid on a property in a coastal Perth suburb.
Drugs including methylamphetamine and MDMA, as well as stolen property were allegedly found in a search of the man's $800,000 Coogee home on Monday.
His 10 charges include possession of a prohibited drug with intent to sell or supply, possessing a controlled weapon and breaching a violence restraining order, and he will appear in Fremantle Magistrates Court on August 29.
