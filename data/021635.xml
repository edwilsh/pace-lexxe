  <title>Kim holds on for British Open crown</title>
  <content>
GOLF: A course record-equalling 64 from England's Jodi Ewart Shadoff was not enough to take the Women's British Open from South Korean Kim In-kyung.
Kim, who famously missed a one-foot putt to win the Kraft Nabisco Championship - now called the ANA Inspiration - in 2012, managed to par the final five holes on the Kingsbarns course in Scotland to hold on to win the title by two shots.
Another Englishwoman, Georgia Hall, had to settle for a tie for third after a 70, alongside American Michelle Wie (66) and German Caroline Masson (67).
A superb run of scoring saw Ewart Shadoff follow a birdie on the second hole with five in a row from the sixth and another on the 13th.
The 29-year-old birdied the 17th to close the gap to two and parred the last to complete a 64, equalling the record set on day one by Wie and matched by Inbee Park in round three.
A breakthrough victory at the CrossFit Games.
