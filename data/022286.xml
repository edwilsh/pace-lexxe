  <title>MRP: Double whack for Cats, Grundy cops two</title>

Grundy tackle knocks out Brown
Ben Brown carried off after this strong tackle by Brodie Grundy

GEELONG'S top-four chances have taken another hit, with key forward Tom Hawkins suspended for two matches and midfielder Mitch Duncan hit with a one-game penalty ahead of Saturday's blockbuster against Richmond.

Meanwhile, Collingwood ruckman Brodie Grundy (two matches), Greater Western Sydney big man Shane Mumford (one match) and Essendon midfielder Zach Merrett (one match) have all been banned in a dramatic round of MRP findings. 

If Merrett accepts his one-match ban for striking Carlton defender Lachie Plowman in the stomach the prolific midfielder will be ineligible for this year's Brownlow Medal. 

Hawkins was charged for striking Sydney defender Dane Rampe in Friday night's clash at Simonds Stadium, with the hit graded intentional conduct with low impact to the head.

The powerful forward would normally have been able to accept a one-match ban with an early guilty plea, but his bad record meant an extra week was added to the penalty.

Hawkins and Rampe get acquainted.

Hawkins has been suspended for identical incidents twice in the past two seasons, most recently in round 11 when he struck Adelaide midfielder Matt Crouch.

His suspension is a significant blow to a Geelong team that will be missing injured captain Joel Selwood, who was expected to undergo ankle surgery on Monday, for the remainder of the home and away season.

Duncan was also charged by the MRP for striking Tom Papley, with the hit graded intentional conduct with medium impact to the body, drawing a one-match ban. 

Tom Papley lines up for goal after this fourth quarter free kick.

The Cats have until 11am Tuesday to notify the AFL if they intend to challenge either verdict at the Tribunal.
