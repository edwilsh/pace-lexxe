  <title>NSW dad accused of pointing gun at child</title>
  <content>
A Sydney man accused of pointing a pistol at his four-year-old daughter will face court after he was charged with a string of offences.
The 32-year-old was arrested after officers attached to a NSW Police terrorism squad allegedly seized three pistols and a shotgun from addresses in Revesby and Granville on Monday.
Police allege mobile phone footage shows the man jokingly pointing a Colt .45 handgun at his child and pulling the trigger, while further footage shows the girl playing with the pistol and also pulling the trigger.
In both videos, the weapon did not discharge.
The father remains in police custody and is due to appear in Burwood Local Court on Tuesday.
Police say the investigation is not terror-related.
