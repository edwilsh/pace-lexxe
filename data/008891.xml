  <title>Royal Adelaide Hospital appoints another stroke specialist after patient deaths, inquest hears</title>
  <content>
The Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) has appointed a third stroke specialist after the deaths of two patients while two doctors were on leave, an inquest has heard.
The inquest in Adelaide has also heard two doctors at the time were working an "intolerable" roster and their leave was approved in error.
Michael John Russell, 60, and Leslie Robert Graham, 87, died in April this year while the hospital's only two specialists, Dr James Taylor and Dr Rebecca Scroop, were on leave.
The Coroners Court heard Dr Scroop was overseas and Dr Taylor was fishing near Victor Harbor, south of Adelaide, and only available to be called in for non-urgent cases.
The inquest heard a radiologist based at the Flinders Medical Centre, Dr Steve Chryssidis, instead gave emergency treatment to Mr Russell and Mr Graham.
However, there were complications and both men died.
The RAH's acting head of radiology, Dr Jim Buckley, told the inquest there had been an "urgent need" for a third interventional neuro-radiologist (INR) for a long time but there was no funding available.
"I knew that things were very stretched for both of them, Dr Scroop and Dr Taylor, and had been for a long time," Dr Buckley told the inquest.
"It's a 24/7 service provided by only two people - that is a very fragile roster indeed.
"This was an ongoing issue with the department; it was just too much work and it was an expanding area and it was putting too much stress on them."
Dr Buckley said if one of the specialists was overseas the other would have to work and be on call for that entire period.
"Which I think is an intolerable situation for anybody," he told the inquest.
Third specialist appointed after deaths

Dr Buckley told the inquest a third INR specialist had since been appointed to help fill the gap.
"There was an urgent need for this but we didn't have any funding available," Dr Buckley told the court.
"All we could do was wait for someone to retire or people leaving so that [their position] would then become available to use so we could appoint a third INR person, and that only happened recently."
The inquest heard that third INR specialist still needed supervision for a short period of time because she needed to build up her experience again after being away from the field.
Under questioning from coroner Mark Johns, Dr Buckley conceded it was problematic if the other two specialists became sick or were unavailable.
"If it's an emergency it's an emergency, but if we had time to deal with this I would be more comfortable with her working with another INR person," Dr Buckley said.
Leave originally approved 'in error'

Dr Buckley said he had originally approved leave for both Dr Scroop and Dr Taylor in the same week in April 2017 "in error" and was "very concerned" when the mistake was noticed by another staff member in March 2017.
He said the INR roster was usually done by Dr Taylor and Dr Scroop and they would then seek his approval once they had worked it out between them.
Dr Buckley said he discussed the issue with both specialists in March 2017 and they decided that another "very versatile and experienced" radiologist could be available to fill the gap during that week in April.
"The leave protocol at that time was not being followed as closely as it has been since," he said.
Dr Buckley said the rostering had since been reviewed and now required the INR specialists to sit down with him while the rosters were being done, as well as cross-sign each other's leave forms.
