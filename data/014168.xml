  <title>OrotonGroup quits the GAP</title>
  <content>
Struggling luxury leather handbag and accessories maker OrotonGroup has quit its franchise agreement with US giant the GAP Inc, as it looks to stabilise the $44 million business and continues to look for a possible buyer.
Oroton said in a statement it was too early to say what the financial impacts would be on the company but it was limiting any future losses by cutting its relationship with the GAP. All six of the loss making GAP stores in Sydney and Melbourne are slated to close by end of January 2018.
 strategic review and the board is considering options including a sale, a capital raising or refinancing of debt facilities after receiving approaches from potential buyers.
Oroton chief executive Ross Lane said on Friday the recent amendment of the Westpac facility and today's agreement with the GAP, are important milestones in the strategic review announced on May 17. 

He said Oroton is also continuing to pursue various strategic processes aimed to maximise value for the company and its stakeholders.
