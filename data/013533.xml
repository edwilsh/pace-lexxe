  <title>Mates came north with a dream</title>
  <content>
A DECISION by three young footballers to leave Tasmania in 1960 to play football at Sandgate would have far-reaching influence on business and bowls on the Sunshine Coast.
Because of a downturn in the Queensland economy, the boys headed home, only to run out of money in Melbourne.
They combined their talents to run a service station for 10 years - joining St Kilda Bowls Club during their last year in Victoria.
The lure of Queensland weather and lifestyle remained, however, and they returned to the Sunshine Coast in 1970.
In 1971, Henricks and Moles Pty Ltd started business in Maroochydore with original partners Peter and Anne Moles, Neil and Shirley Henricks and Kevin and Marcelle Henricks.
A year later, Wayne and Dianne Henricks joined them.
Neil, Peter and Wayne became involved in the footwear industry, while Kevin developed the business called North Coast Marine.
The partners' original shoe store in Duporth Ave, Maroochydore, was bought from Mr and Mrs Cliff Butt.
And when Butt's Shopping Centre was built in the early '70s, the shoe store became the original tenant of the new Maroochydore shopping complex.
The next move was to establish a store in the new Sands Shopping Centre across the road. The store was a huge success and subsequently sold to Lex and Julie Biggar (Tootsies).
Because of overseas trends and the advent of higher rents in shopping centres, the partners decided to pioneer the "shoe barn" style of business. The first of these barns was in the Jim Comino complex on Maud St - an area Jim had great faith in.
Another barn was established in Caloundra and later a new barn at Warana, which they saw as a fast-growing area with huge potential.
After establishing a shoe section at Beerwah, in co-operation with Don Murphy at Wimberleys, a final operation was established at Morayfield Rd, Caboolture.
Neil, Kevin and Peter established themselves as well-respected bowlers during this period, winning many club, district and state titles, with all three representing both district and state.
In 1986, Kevin was selected to represent Australia at the Edinburgh Commonwealth Games.
The company then entered a process of consolidation.
A bowls section was established at Warana and the original shop under the Big Top was sold.
David Moles took control of the Morayfield Rd barn in Caboolture which is now trading as The Work Locker.
Paul Henricks along with Tim Diedricks, re-established the bowls shop at Warana (and now located at Mooloolaba Bowls Club), trading under Bowlers Paradise.
Meanwhile, Wayne Henricks, together with his son Stephen and daughter Lisa, went from strength to strength at Shu Valu in Maroochydore.
