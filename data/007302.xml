The great Australian dream of buying a house is one step closer for a North Wollongong couple after appearing on the Millionaire Hot Seat.
School teacher Jessica Calvert, 26, said attending trivia nights might become a new hobby after winning $51,000 on Monday night's episode for knowing which actors were in the movie Bridesmaids.
"I've seen that movie so many times so as soon as I read it I nearly cried because I thought 'I know it, don't stuff this up'," she said.
"We really want to buy a house, my husband [Josh] and I just got married last year and we've been saving our butts off to buy a house so this is a massive step towards that - and I get a puppy."
Mrs Calvert was the first of six contestants to take to the Hot Seat next to host Eddie McGuire after answering 14 out of 15 preliminary questions with the "fastest finger", however "passed" on the fourth direct question.

It wasn't until the final minutes of the show she made it back to the hot seat for the winning question, her partner coming on stage to hug her once McGuire announced she had won.
"I actually had a [student] find me on Facebook and inboxed me 'your shout for lunch tomorrow Miss'," Mrs Calvert laughed.
