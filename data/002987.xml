  <title>New lead in Gail King cold case: SA police</title>
  <content>
The suspected murder of Adelaide mother-of-two Gail King two decades ago could be on the verge of a breakthrough, with police obtaining new information related to her disappearance.
Ms King was reported missing in July 1997 after her partner, who is a suspect, said she left the Yorke Peninsula property the duo were renovating for work in Adelaide.
When her partner returned to their Brahma Lodge home with the children the next day, Ms King's car was in the driveway but she could not be found.
Police on Monday said they were recently been in contact with someone who provided a "a different taint" to the investigation.
"While I can't comment too much on what we have, I can confirm that we have information that is credible and needs to be explored," Detective Inspector Greg Hutchins said.
"It is another avenue we need to look at."
A $200,000 reward is on offer for anyone who provides information leading to the arrest and conviction of Ms King's suspected murdered or the recovery of the woman's remains.
