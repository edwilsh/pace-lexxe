  <title>One Nation dumps Queensland election candidate John Cox</title>
  <content>
Pauline Hanson's One Nation party has dumped another Queensland state election candidate.
John Cox was planning to stand for the party in the electorate of Redcliffe, north of Brisbane.
Mr Cox made headlines earlier this year over comments on social media questioning the 9/11 attacks in the United States.
At the time One Nation stood by him, but that has now changed.
State campaign director Michael Pucci confirmed to the ABC Mr Cox was no longer running for the seat.
He said the move was over "internal stuff", adding "people leave for various reasons".
Mr Pucci refused to confirm if the dumping was over controversy caused by Mr Cox, only saying he was not involved in the decision process.
"The decision was made by the executive," he said.
Mr Pucci said One Nation was now looking for a new candidate for Redcliffe.
Mr Cox's profile has been removed from the One Nation website, and his Facebook page appears to have been deleted.
He joins the growing list of candidates who have been dropped by the party for various reasons ahead of the state poll.
