  <title>The Mr Robot Season 3 Trailer Is Creepy As Hell</title>
  <content>
Video: Your first, full look at the third season of USA's Mr Robot is here and we have absolutely no idea what's going on. But, that's exactly what we want when it comes to the continually twisty, turny show.

The editing, music and voiceover are also just straight up creepy. More than usual even. It's a solid trailer.

There are a lot of interesting things in that trailer, many of which involved Tyrell Wellick, who was mysteriously and purposefully absent for most of the last season. There are also new characters (Bobby Cannavale!), surprising scenarios (is that the military toward the end?), and fsociety really, really going all out with the use of masks.

Mr Robot is back in the US on October 11.
