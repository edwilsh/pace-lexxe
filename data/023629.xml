  <title>Persistence pays off for Fashion winner</title>
  <content>
AFTER five years of strutting her stuff on the catwalks, Brooke Prince has finally taken home the top prize at the Darwin Waterfront Fashions on the Field competition.
The Ludmilla local made it through to the finals on Ladies Day, and chose to wear the same outfit in the Darwin Cup Day final.
"I got my dress about two months ago and I handed it to my local milliner, Peacock Millinery, to create something amazing," Ms Prince said.
As part of her prize, Ms Prince will travel to Melbourne as a finalist in the Fashions on the Field competition at the Emirates Melbourne Cup.
"I'm so excited, I'm so thrilled about that," she said.
"We've done really well in Melbourne for the past few years ... I'm really excited to represent the Territory."
