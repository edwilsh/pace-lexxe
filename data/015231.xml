Not to undersell for one moment the imposing manner of the edict's delivery, but the problem there, as it so often is in football commentary, appeared to be one of context.
Specifically, what in the merry Blue Hades could this possibly mean at that stage of the game? The contest was in its infancy, the pies were barely warming in the concession stands, and it was at least three-and-a-half quarters too early for anyone to be thinking of running down the clock.
That is, unless the comment was a general observation about all football matches, in which case it wasn't all that germane to the given situation.
Speaking of the latter type of observation, in the third quarter of Collingwood v Adelaide, Leigh Matthews had one he'd prepared earlier.

"To pick up a big margin, you've got to stop the team in front scoring."
Not a devastating breakthrough in higher football mathematics, perhaps, but you can't fault the accuracy. If a team is trailing by miles and miles and has some ambition of narrowing the deficit, it will tend to fatally harpoon their ambitions if the other mob keeps blasting goals.
This point seems a little short of the revelatory, however.
Elsewhere, in the first quarter at Carlton v Geelong, Matthew Richardson made reference to, "The red light going off on the coaches' box".
This may have led some to wonder precisely what activity was taking place in that enclosure, at least prior to the red light going off.
A little later on, Richo somewhat clarified the situation by adding that "a few alarm bells" were emanating from the same direction.
Although it does sound like an extraordinarily well-equipped facility in terms of technology, one has to wonder what productive work could be achieved by the beleaguered coaching staff, given all the alarm bells clanging and the red lights flashing on and off. The league might need to take a look into this.
Matthew Pavlich, normally economical with words and rather incisive in match analysis, had an uncharacteristic explosion of verbosity late in the West Coast v Brisbane game: "We've seen a number of times today a handball that's into a pocket of space that really makes it challenging for defenders - whoever it is, West Coast or Brisbane - to get back on their men. They're playing in front, they're playing assertive, but it's that handball that gets a player out in space and the opportunity to get that long deep ball in."
There was a silence of comprehensive non-understanding around the nation broken only by the gentle tinkling of viewers' shattered brains settling to the ground.
And then Dermott Brereton said, in all of five words, "gets 'em over the back", and Pav responded "yup".
As Inspector Clouseau might have observed, "the case, she is solve-ered".
