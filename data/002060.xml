  <title>Glenvale woman charged over Rangeville attempted murder</title>
  <content>
BREAKING: A woman has been charged with attempted murder more than a week after a man was shot twice outside a Rangeville home.

Toowoomba detectives today charged a Glenvale woman, 26, with attempted murder after an alleged shooting incident outside a Curzon St home on July 19.

Police will allege just after 1am that day, a 20-year-old man was speaking with two men outside the home when he was shot in the knee and abdomen.

The Glenvale woman is the second to be charged in relation to the incident and will appear in Toowoomba Magistrates Court tomorrow.

It follows charges against a Scarborough man, 23, who was earlier this month charged with attempted murder, possessing a firearm and ammunition, driving offences and stealing.

He was remanded in custody to appear in the Toowoomba Magistrates Court on September 14.
