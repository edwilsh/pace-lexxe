Boxing champion Lauryn Eagle has been charged after she allegedly tested positive for methamphetamine in a random drug test when she was pulled over by police.
The 29-year-old sports star was behind the wheel of a black Audi Q5 when she was  on Henry Lawson Drive in Peakhurst on July 12.
After testing negative for alcohol she was given a random drug test, which allegedly returned a positive reading. She was arrested and taken to Kogarah police station where a further sample of her saliva was taken for analysis before she was released
Ms Eagle was charged on Wednesday for allegedly driving with an illicit drug in her system.
The boxer, who won the Australian super-featherweight title last year, will defend the charges, her lawyer Adam Houda said in a tweet.
"Her prescription medications have brought about the positive result," he wrote. "The medical evidence will prove it."

At the time of her arrest, Ms Eagle told Channel 9's Today she was taking a number of prescription medications.
"[My reading] came back positive, I relayed all the information to them about my doctor diagnosing me with narcolepsy, depression and ADHD," she told Today at the time.
Ms Eagle said she takes Modafinil for her narcolepsy and medication for her ADHD.
She is scheduled to appear at Sutherland Local Court on September 26.
