  <title>Teenager crushed to death by bull on farm in WA's south</title>
  <content>
A woman has died in hospital after being crushed by a large bull she was herding on a farm in WA's south.
A police spokesman said the 19-year-old woman was found unconscious yesterday in a paddock on a farm at Dalyup, 35 kilometres north-west of Esperance.
It is understood the woman, an Esperance local, was herding the bull when she was struck into a fence railing by the animal.
She was rushed to hospital but died from her injuries a short time later.
The police spokesman said WorkSafe had been advised and were investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident.
WorkSafe spokeswoman Caroline De Vaney said two officers were being sent from Bunbury to Esperance to investigate the death, with the formal investigation due to begin tomorrow.
A report will be prepared for the coroner.
Local farmer Wes Graham, who owns several properties at Dalyup, said bulls could weigh up to 1,000 kilograms and mating season had begun, which made the animals more unpredictable.
