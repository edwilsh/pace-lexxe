  <title>Weather warning: Storm to hit WA south west including Perth</title>
  <content>
Residents in Perth and the South West are being warned to brace for wild weather, including damaging winds and possible hail, with a cold front expected to cross the coast late on Monday morning.
The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said the coast would be hit by wind gusts of up to 125 kilometres per hour between 10:00am and midday, which could cause damage to homes.
There is also the possibility of heavy rain and hail early this afternoon.
"Conditions will ease after the passage of the cold front though cold, squally showers with possible thunderstorms and small hail will continue over the area for the remainder of Monday," a severe weather warning issued by the BOM said.
The Department of Fire and Emergency Services is advising people to shelter away from trees and powerlines, as well as stormwater drains and streams.
Electrical appliances should be unplugged, and people have been asked not to use landline telephones if there is lightning.
People are being urged to stay out of the ocean and rivers.
The worst-affected areas will be between Perth and Albany, including inland to Northam and Katanning.
Residents are being warned to clear up loose items around their homes.
