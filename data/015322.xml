  <title>Who will win this year's Avon Descent?</title>
  <content>
AROUND 370 competitors will take part in this weekend's Avon Descent. PerthNow will be keeping you up-to-date with all the latest thrills and spills from the whitewater event.
Defending single kayak champion Josh Kippin and second-placed Brendan Rice will contest the race as a duo this year in preparation for the World Championships in South Africa in September.
The pair are favourites for the duo title and their absence in the solo race has left the door open for Matthew Dean to potentially step up to take line honours after finishing third last year.
Matt Even and Nick Gardner will look to go one better than their second place in 2016 in the power craft section.
However, defending champions Michael Prosser and Perrin Franks are not going to give up their hard-earned crown without a fight.
