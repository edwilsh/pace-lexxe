  <title>Aussie farm worker pulls kangaroo to freedom</title>
  <content>
The touching moment a tradie from Goondiwindi in south west Queensland rescued a small kangaroo from a narrow ditch has been captured on camera.
The workers were installing an irrigation pipe and arrived the next morning to find the animal had fallen into the trench.
The young roo appears reluctant at first but allows worker, Fritz White, to pull it by its paws to freedom.

In the video the animal can be seen pausing to look at it White before happily hopping away.
