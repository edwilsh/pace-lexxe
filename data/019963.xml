Legends slam KO debate
AFL legend Brendan Fevola has slammed critics of Brodie Grundy, following his tackle on North Melbourne's Ben Brown.
Brown was knocked unconscious in the tackle and it has sparked calls for the Collingwood player to spend time on the sidelines.
But Fevola sees nothing wrong with the tackle, saying it was an example of how young footballers are taught to execute a tackle.
"I said in the meeting earlier, 'that's a perfect tackle'," Fevola told Seven's AFL Game Day.
"It used to be all right back in the day.
"Auskick kids are being taught to tackle like that, it's a sad day when blokes are getting rubbed out for that.
Geelong star Patrick Dangerfield was handed a week on the sidelines for a similar tackle on Carlton's Matthew Kreuzer. That incident also left the ruckman unconscious, and the AFL has now set a precedent in how it views such tackles.
But former Collingwood captain Nick Maxwell feels the AFL have got it wrong, saying they are too quick to penalise players as a result of injuries sustained.
"It has to come down to their intent," Maxwell told Seven.
"Because that tackle will happen 20 times, and once someone will get knocked out. The other 19 times the same thing could happen and they don't get knocked out.
"You can't ask a player to make that decision in a half a second - he's just trying to lay the tackle. If his intent is to pick him up and smash him into the ground, you can clearly see that.
"His intent their wasn't to grab him and smash him into the ground. He's wrestling a guy who is 110kg and he's trying to stop him getting his hands free."
But Fevola has an interesting solution to combat the head injuries being sustained by AFL players as a result of heavy tackling.
"I've got an easy solution - make everyone wear a helmet," Fevola said.
"Juniors, all the way to senior."

'Time for AFL to make a statement'
Concussion isn't the only issue currently facing the AFL, according the former star Kane Cornes.
Corner urged the AFL to respond to the growing number of incidents involving players 'diving' or simulating injury to win a freekick.
The former Port Adelaide player believes it has got out of hand and the league bosses must step in.
"Diving is an issue in the AFL," Cornes said.
"It's time the AFL actually warned someone about this diving.
"I'll put it on the agenda that I did it myself during my career and it was a regret of mine.
"Players are getting away with it. It's time for the AFL to make a statement. There needs to be a warning and the AFL needs to clamp down on it."
