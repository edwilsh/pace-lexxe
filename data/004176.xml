A JAPANESE building company has purchased a 40 per cent stake in Hunter builder McDonald Jones Homes.
McDonald Jones Homes Group announced on Tuesday that the firm, Asahi Kasei Homes, had purchased the 40 per cent share in the building company, which includes McDonald Jones Homes, Mojo Homes, Wilson Homes, Hayman Homes and MJH Multi.

The company's managing director Andrew Helmers said the investment was "recognition of the success of the business over past 30 years and provides the company with the capital to activate our growth strategy".

"The expansion into the Australian market by Asahi Kasei Homes enhances our already robust financial position, and provides new opportunities in research and development, home design and construction which will be of great benefit to our customers," Mr Helmers said.

McDonald Jones Homes was founded in 1987 and has its head office in Thornton.
