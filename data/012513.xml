  <title>Donald Trump: Former adviser says President just needs a 'strong coach'</title>
  <content>
As United States President Donald Trump seeks to rebuild credibility after one of the most damaging weeks in his chaotic presidency, a former adviser says the White House just needs a "strong coach".
Barry Bennett, who was an adviser to Mr Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, hopes the , will bring out the best in the President.
"I think we're in, what, White House 2.0, which I think is a good sign," he said.
"General Kelly is a serious man, it's a good team over there but they need a coach, strong coach, and I think John Kelly could be that coach."

Trump tweet
Mr Bennett said some of Mr Trump's former advisers, like dumped chief of staff and mainstream Republican Reince Priebus, let Mr Trump down by trying to force him to change.
He said the new team would be better off giving Mr Trump a list of suggested topics to tweet on rather than instructing him to dump social media.
"I think that they went in and thought they were going to tell him he can't do these things," Mr Bennett said.
"Well, he's a 72-year-old billionaire, he's not used to hearing no.
"You've got to go in and say, 'I understand you want to do this. Here's a better path to do it,' and my experience with him is he listens to advice."
'Make the President a better president'

The White House has been plunged into further chaos after the .
Mr Bennett said that by the end, Mr Trump did not trust Mr Priebus.
"I think the President clearly did not have a trust relationship with Reince. Towards the end Reince was virtually isolated," he said.
"So he's got to trust the person and the person has to be able to provide private counsel, not leaked counsel, and then try to make the President a better president."
While the headline news has been unrelentingly negative for Mr Trump, his former adviser said his base was sticking with him and if he could continue to build on the economy he would remain in a strong electoral position.
"America loves good times. And if he could turn those, there's so much capital piled up in the economy waiting for a place to invest," Mr Bennett said.
"If that happens, we've seen record corporate profits this week, he'll get very popular, very fast."
