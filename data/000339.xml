  <content>
POLICE investigating the disappearance and suspected murder of 16-year-old Tiffany Taylor from Waterford West searched a location of interest in Fernvale on Saturday.
Following a public appeal on July 13, investigators received information from the public which prompted a search of dense bushland near Banks Creek Rd.
Logan detectives, search co-ordinators from Rosewood and Lowood and Search and Rescue Officers from the State Emergency Service scoured the bush.
Police said "no evidence of interest" was located.
Tiffany was last seen around 10am on Sunday, July 12, 2015, leaving a motel on Loganlea Rd.
A 60-year-old Annerley man has been charged with her murder, however Tiffany's body has not yet been located.
Investigations are continuing.
