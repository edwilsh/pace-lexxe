  <title>Former SA Liberal MP willing to back Labor</title>
  <content>
Former South Australian Liberal party leader-turned-independent Martin Hamilton-Smith says he is willing to do a deal with whichever party wins the most seats at next year's election.
Mr Hamilton-Smith has not ruled out doing a deal with his old party or Labor in order to bring about stable government.
"If either of the major parties was within one vote of a majority, I think all of the independents would be under a lot of pressure to give South Australians stable government," Mr Hamilton-Smith told ABC radio on Monday.
