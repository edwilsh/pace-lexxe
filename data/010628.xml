  <title>Farmers welcome rain after long dry</title>
  <content>
THE grass is green and puddles are fresh at brothers Chris and Ben Hayes' dairy farm at Cookernup, 13km north of Harvey.
Their 250ha property, which runs 400 head of Holstein cattle, got a drenching this week as a strong cold front moved across southern WA.
Monday's 37mm downpour was a welcome turn after what Chris Hayes said was a relatively dry first half of the year.
Mr Hayes said the farm ran out of silage three weeks ago after getting almost no rain in May and most of June.
But the farm recorded almost 300mm last month.
"July just suddenly took a huge turn and we hope that will continue," Mr Hayes said.
"Before that we were just feeding grain and hay flat out.
"We're on our first lot of grazing on oats now, usually we would be on our third.
"The rain is great, but the cold weather has stunted the grass growth a bit."
Southern parts of WA, fortunate to get solid July rainfall after a drier-than-average May and June, were not the only areas to get rain this week.
Parts of the eastern grain belt, where crops are struggling to germinate through a dry spell, received rain, easing the nerves of many farmers.
Dry conditions recently caused National Australia Bank to wind back its national wheat crop forecast to 23.3 million tonnes.
"The front produced some light to moderate rainfall through northern and eastern parts of the south-west land division," Weather Bureau weather services acting manager Bradley Santos said.
In the 24 hours from 9am Monday, previously dry areas had welcome falls: Geraldton had 9mm, Morawa 4.8mm, Carnamah 4.8mm, Coorow 10mm, Dalwallinu 10mm and Watheroo 13mm.
