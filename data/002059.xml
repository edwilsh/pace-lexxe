  <title>Labor conference backs rent protections</title>
  <content>
Labor has supported the introduction of new protections for renters in NSW, including a requirement for landlords to justify restrictions on rent increases above the inflation rate.

Labor's building sustainable communities committee noted that almost a third of NSW citizens live in rented properties "with a growing proportion of those being families".
"The next Labor government will modernise rental rules to provide certainty, balance and fairness to renters and landlords," it said.
The conference passed a motion that says if rent increases are to exceed inflation NSW Labor will ensure "the obligation to show the increase is not excessive should be shifted to the landlord rather than the tenant".
Other protections include banning the practice of "rental bidding", which pits potential tenants against each other in auctions to nominate higher weekly payments in online auctions, driving up the cost of rental leases.

That practice is used in the United States, but similar platforms allowing such auctions are set to launch in Australia , reports say.
The conference also passed motions removing no-grounds evictions and strengthening the rights of pet owners.

The deputy chairman of the committee, City of Sydney councillor Linda Scott, said: "With crushing rises in house prices renters are the forgotten people in this debate. Labor must stand for strengthening protections for renters."
Cr Scott said the proposed measures extended to people in precarious living conditions, such as boarding houses and caravans, and would help them avoid primary homelessness.
Nearly one-third of Australians rent, according to ABS research. Renters in Sydney live with protections much weaker than in international jurisdictions, according to the Tenants Union.
A 2017 survey by consumer group Choice found  with one in five fearing eviction and nearly 10 per cent being evicted on a "no-grounds" basis at least once.
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the NSW Labor conference passed a motion that included support for limiting rent increases to once annually, capped at the inflation rate. In fact, this aspect was removed prior to being considered by the conference.
