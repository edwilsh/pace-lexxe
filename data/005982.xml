  <title>Drugs dried up for slain Vic dealer: court</title>
  <content>
A Melbourne cannabis dealer found stabbed to death in 2008 had been scoring from a couple known as "auntie and uncle" before a drug drought hit the scene, a court has been told.
Christopher Lavery, 31, is standing trial for the murder of 24-year-old James Russouw, a dealer whose supply had seemingly dried up, the Supreme Court of Victoria was told on Tuesday.
School mate and fellow former dealer Thomas Perkins told the court that on the night of his death, Mr Russouw had received a phone call to the effect he would have drugs to sell that night "depending on quality".
