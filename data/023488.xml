  <title>McDonalds blocked by people power</title>
  <content>
GLOBAL fast food giant McDonalds can't build a 24-hour restaurant in Guildford after its application was knocked back on Monday.
In what's been described as a win for the people, Guildford residents had been campaigning against the application since the plans first went public.
McDonalds had wanted to build a 24-hour restaurant at the site behind the Guildford Hotel.
But on Monday, a development assessment panel refused the plans, citing a lack of car bays, the close proximity to a local primary school and that the new store could diminish the character of the suburb.
While local residents are celebrating the decision, the fight could continue.
McDonalds can now appeal the decision at the State Administrative Tribunal, but the fast food giant is yet to comment on its next move.
