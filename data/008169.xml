  <title>New Zealand Labour Party leader Jacinda Ardern asked about motherhood plans on day one</title>
  <content>
New Zealand's new Labour leader had been in the job less than 24 hours before she was asked about balancing her career and potential motherhood.

Key points:

Opposition Leader was asked whether she felt she had to "make a choice between having babies and having a career"
Jacinda Ardern said she had "no problem" with the question
But she was angered at the suggestion other women could be asked that question

Jacinda Ardern took over as Opposition Leader on Tuesday after Andrew Little stepped down, seven weeks out from the next election, following months of bad polling.
Host of The Project in New Zealand, Jesse Mulligan, last night asked Ms Ardern, who is 37 and does not have children, whether she had to decide between having a career and becoming a parent.
"I've got a question, and we've been discussing today whether I'm allowed to ask it or not," Mulligan said.
"Let me put it this way. A lot of women in New Zealand feel like they have to make a choice between having babies and having a career, or continuing their career at a certain point in their lives - late 30s."
"Thank you for reminding the New Zealand public of my age," Ms Ardern interjected, to laughter.
Mulligan continued: "Is that a decision that you feel you have to make, or that you feel that you've already made?"
The question drew sharp criticism, with commentators asking whether a male politician would be questioned along the same lines.

Ingrid Hipkiss: Noooooo @TheProject_NZ not on board with asking @jacindaardern how she would juggle politics or parenting ..

Hilary Barry: I see @jacindaardern has already been asked about babies vs career. Please can every nob who asks that ask the same of Bill English?

Jessica Rose: Can someone tell me how Bill [English] manages to juggle fatherhood, full time work, and staying so slim? What's his secret? I want a 2 page spread.
Ms Ardern replied that she had "no problem" with being asked the question.
"I've been really open about that dilemma because I think probably lots of women face it," she said.
"For me, my position is no different to the woman who works three jobs, or who might be in a position where they are juggling lots of responsibilities.
"You've just got to take every day as it comes and try and see if you can make the best of the lot you're given.
"So I'm not pre-determining any of that, just like most of the women out here who just make their lives work."
Asking pregnancy plans 'is totally unacceptable in 2017'

However, this morning she took objection to radio show panellist Mark Richardson saying that employers "need to know that type of thing from the women you are employing".
"The question is, is it OK for a PM to take maternity leave while in office?" he said.
Ms Ardern said she accepted she would be asked that question because she had previously been open about the "dilemma".
"But... for other women it is totally unacceptable in 2017 to say that women should have to answer that question in the workplace," she said.
"It is unacceptable. It is a woman's decision about when they choose to have children.
"It should not predetermine whether they are given a job or have job opportunities."
Richardson defended his remarks, saying a potential employer had a right to know if they would have to let a staff member take "a year of leave".
"I'm not saying don't employ that person," he said.
Ms Ardern countered: "Why would you ask if it wasn't going to prejudice your decision?"
The Opposition Leader said she would be taking time to reconsider her party's policies ahead of the election, admitting Labour faced the "campaign of our lives ahead".
