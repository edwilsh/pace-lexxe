  <title>Man snapped pic of teen in toilet: police</title>
  <content>
A Gold Coast shopping centre employee followed a teenage boy into a public toilet and photographed him, police say.
The 27-year-old employee of a Biggera Waters shopping centre was due to face the Southport Magistrates Court on Monday over the incident on Sunday.
He is charged with indecent treatment of a child under 16, possessing child exploitation material, making child exploitation material and observations or recordings in breach of privacy.
Police say the boy noticed him take the photo and told his father, who detained him until police arrived.
Police say they also found a video on the man's phone of two children believed to have been filmed in the public toilets of another Gold Coast shopping centre in June.
