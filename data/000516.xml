  <title>Anthony Scaramucci 'sent wife text to mark birth of their son'</title>
  <content>
New York: Anthony Scaramucci's wife filed for divorce while she was nine months pregnant and when their son arrived last week he congratulated her by text message, according to reports.
The new White House communications director, who in the space of a week has gone from being a little-known financier to a household name - thanks largely to his expletive-laced rants about his new colleagues - is yet to confirm the divorce proceedings.

Scaramucci makes a public jab at Priebus

The new US Communications Director has linked the White House Chief of Staff to leaking in an interview on CNN.

He tweeted a request for prayers for his family. The New York Post reported that Deidre Scaramucci, 38, filed divorce papers on July 6 at Nassau County Supreme Court, in New York. They were married for three years and she gave birth to their first son, Nicholas, in early 2014.
Their second son, James, arrived last Monday in New York City, while Mr Scaramucci was at a Boy Scout jamboree with President Donald Trump in West Virginia.

"When James was born, he sent her a text saying: 'Congratulations, I'll pray for our child,'" a source told the paper.
"She's mad. They aren't really speaking right now," the source said.

"The pain runs deep. Anthony tells her she's not that smart, that he's out of her league."

Reportedly he did not meet his newborn son until Friday evening, at the end of a whirlwind first week in Washington in which he witnessed the ousting from the White House of his bitter rival, Reince Priebus, who had served as chief of staff. An associate of Mr Scaramucci, 53, defended him, saying that the child arrived early.Photo: AP
"There was discussion between him, her and the divorce attorneys about Anthony going to the hospital, and unfortunately the delivery was sudden," the source told the paper. "There's been a lot of lies."
Mr Scaramucci's mother, Marie, who lives close to the marital home on Long Island, told the paper she was yet to meet her new grandson.Photo: AP
"No, I haven't," she said when reached by phone. "There's a reason for it and I don't want to discuss it."
Headlines about the increasingly acrimonious divorce are not what Mr Scaramucci, nicknamed The Mooch, would have wished for his first week in Washington.
"OK, the Mooch showed up a week ago," he said, calling a reporter on Wednesday night. "This is going to get cleaned up very shortly, OK? Because I nailed these guys."
But the slick, brash New Yorker appeared unflustered by the separation from his wife. The evening of his appointment as White House communications director - an announcement that forced the resignation of Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary - Mr Scaramucci was hosting a graduation party for Anthony Jr, his son with his first wife, Lisa.
The party, held at the Hunt & Fish Club in Manhattan - a restaurant he co-owns - featured DJs and a performance by rapper French Montana.
"He was asking everyone around him how he did at his first press conference," said Eytan Sugerman, who jointly owns the restaurant with Mr Scaramucci.
He said Mr Scaramucci is already preparing to be lampooned on Saturday Night Live - this weekend Variety magazine reported that Ben Stiller or Mario Cantone from Sex and the City were leading contenders.
"He was thinking Meryl Streep or Julia Roberts could play him," added Mr Sugerman.
