Two men have been killed in separate car crashes at opposite ends of NSW.
The first man died after his ute veered off the road and hit a tree near Albury in the state's south at about midday on Sunday.
The 77-year-old, who police say was the sole occupant of the ute, was treated by members of the public but died at the scene.
A second man was killed in a suspected head-on collision in the NSW Hunter region.
Police say the man was trapped in his car and died after the collision in Howes Valley just before 2pm.
A woman was treated by paramedics and taken to John Hunter Hospital.
