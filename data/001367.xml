  <title>Toddler suddenly disappeared: NSW court</title>
  <content>
The toddler daughter of a NSW woman who allegedly talked about sacrificing a child to a "wolfman" suddenly disappeared from a block of units where she lived, a court has heard.
Neighbour Ellen Campbell told the Newcastle Supreme Court on Monday she'd been suspicious about what happened to the toddler.
The toddler's mother, 44, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has pleaded not guilty to murdering the little girl between Christmas 2000 and Christmas 2001.
