  <title>Magra man facing fisheries charges</title>
  <content>
A MAGRA man is in hot water after allegedly being caught with more than 600 undersized commercial scallops.
Police said the man was found with 780 commercial scallops.
It follows the closure of the recreational scallop season, which means an on-land possession limit of 100 scallops applies.
The man will be charged via summons for allegedly possessing more than 100 scallops and possessing scallops smaller than the minimum size - 100mm - in relation to 601 commercial scallops.
Anyone with information about illegal fishing activities is urged to contact on the 24-hour hotline 0427 655 557.
