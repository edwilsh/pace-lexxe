  <title>New South Wales left Queensland broke from day one</title>
  <content>
The government of New South Wales left the new colony of Queensland "broke" with the equivalent of just six cents in its treasury coffers when the Sunshine State began in December 1859.
It could not even pay the small band of public servants who were then running Australia's fledgling state, Queensland historian Harold Thornton said.Photo: State of Library of Queens;land
In the first of a series of "little histories" of the birthplace of Brisbane, Fairfax Media and historian Harold Thornton will explain curiosities of Brisbane's early days.
Harold Thornton has his own story to tell.Photo: Leanne White
He is the son of Merle Thornton who in 1965 chained her ankle to the public bar of Brisbane's Regatta Hotel in 1965 with a girlfriend to force a change to let women drink in public bars.
And his sister is Australian actor Sigrid Thornton.

However, Harold Thornton's specialty is Queensland, Brisbane and Queen's Wharf histories.

He has selected a series of "little histories" as the birthplace of Brisbane again evolves once again from the place the Aboriginal people called  into Queensland's new hotel, casino and entertainment precinct.Photo: Must Do Brisbane
The first of these little histories tells how Queensland started off "bankrupt".
Timeline
1823 - John Oxley, as the surveyor-general of New South Wales, surveyed and named the Brisbane River.
1825 - Lieutenant Henry Miller, servicemen and convicts from Redcliffe built a wharf where the Riverside Expressway is today. That wharf was at first the "King's Wharf", and became "Queen's Wharf".
1829 - The convict-built Commissariat Store opened in William Street.
1859 - Queensland separated from New South Wales.
How this history unfolded
The Brisbane River was the maritime artery of the colony, from the Pacific Ocean to the interior where coal had been discovered at what is now Ipswich.
In 1859, Queen's Wharf was the principal place where Queensland's taxes were gathered.
The original Queensland Treasury office was located right beside to the source of revenue, in a small building on top of Queen's Wharf Road, where it meets William Street.
"The not always friendly rivalry between Queensland and New South Wales can be traced to the Queen's Wharf precinct in 1859," Mr Thornton said.
"When New South Wales closed off its books to form the new colony the first governor, Sir George Ferguson Bowen, found only seven pence halfpenny (six cents) left in the Treasury coffers."
In a letter to a friend in June 1860, Bowen records the events.
"At the start of all other Colonies, the Governor ... has been supported by an armed force and been authorised to draw on the Imperial Treasury for the expenses of the public service. 
"But I was an autocrat; the sole source of authority ... I started with just 7 1/2d. (seven pence halfpenny) in the Treasury.
"A thief broke into the Treasury a few nights after my arrival, and carried off the 7 1/2d."
Bowen had to borrow money from his own accounts to pay the state's first public servants.
"So, I borrowed money from the banks until our revenue came in, and our estimates already show ... a considerable balance in excess of the proposed expenditure for the year," Bowen wrote.   
The North Australian, Ipswich and General Advertiser reported on the crime on Tuesday 27 December 1859.
"Some burglar broke open the room in ... the Treasury Office and stole a cash-box which only contained seven pence in coppers. The man is a fool as well as a rogue, or he would have waited a better time, until some revenue was collected."
By the end of 1860 Queensland had collected 178,589 pounds in revenue, largely from import duties and the excise on rum.
Perhaps this is the real reason why Queensland has been tearing strips off New South Wales in State of Origin football. 
This is the first in a series of weekly "little Brisbane histories" to be run by Fairfax Media as the
