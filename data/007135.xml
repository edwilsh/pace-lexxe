  <title>Small Pacific countries lead the way on breastfeeding</title>
  <content>
No country in the world is meeting the internationally recommended standards on breastfeeding, but a combined report from UNICEF and the World Health Organisation reveals that some of those nations that come closest are right here in the Pacific.
There are 23 countries that have achieved a breastfeeding rate above sixty percent, and they include Solomon Islands, Kiribati, the Federated States of Micronesia, Timor Leste, and Nauru.
And the report says it wouldn't take much to push more countries in the right direction, with estimates suggesting an annual investment of less than five US dollars per newborn would raise global rates above fifty percent in less than ten years.
Sheldon Yett is UNICEF's Pacific Representative, based in Fiji, another Pacific country which he says is making strides on raising breast-feeding rates.
