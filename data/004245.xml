Man pointed gun at daughter: police

Phone footage allegedly showed a four-year-old girl playing with an automatic pistol and pulling the trigger without effect.

NSW Police say the gun - a Colt .45 calibre pistol - did not discharge.
Officers seized two Colts, a .25 calibre Walther pistol and a Bentley 12-gauge shotgun from properties in Sydney's southwest as part of their investigation, NSW Police previously said in a statement.

"Police also accessed mobile phone video footage which allegedly shows the man skylarking with one of the Colt .45 handguns."
The father, who can't be named for legal reasons, did not appear in court on Tuesday and did not apply for bail.

His lawyer, Eidan Havas, outside court asked for "the community to keep an open mind before casting the stone against my client".
