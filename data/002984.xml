  <title>Anthony Scaramucci reportedly paid $100,000 for a cameo in the 'Wall Street' sequel</title>
  <content>
Before Anthony Scaramucci entered the halls of the White House as the Trump administration's communications director, he was a figure in the New York financial world. And when the sequel to one of the most well-known movies about finance came around, he wanted to be in it.

According to , Scaramucci paid $US100,000 for a brief cameo in Oliver Stone's 2010 movie, "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps" - the disappointing sequel to Stone's classic 1987 movie, "Wall Street," which earned Michael Douglas a best actor Oscar for his performance as Gordon Gekko.

Scaramucci, a former Wall Street executive, appears twice in the movie for about 15 seconds of screen time, playing an unnamed short seller working for Josh Brolin's character. 

Here's the line he has: "Churchill Schwartz has a huge position in this thing and I want to get you in that stock."

See if you can find him in this clip from the movie:

Along with the screen time, Scaramucci's financial contribution to the movie also got the logo of his global investment firm, SkyBridge Capital, to be displayed prominently in a scene where Douglas' Gekko character attends a charity auction.

The Daily Beast also reports that Donald Trump filmed a one-minute cameo in the movie, in which he has small talk with Gekko at a barber shop. However, that scene was cut from the movie. 

One of Trump's lines: "Has anyone ever told you that you'd look great - really great - in a comb over?"

Douglas looks really pleased he has to work with Trump.

Watch the scene:

Critics did not like "Wall Street: Money Never Sleep." The movie only has a  on Rotten Tomatoes. But it did earn over  at the box office (it was made for $US70 million).
