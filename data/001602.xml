  <title>Survivor turns 'X-rated' in naked challenge</title>
  <content>
WE'VE barely begun the current season of Australian Survivor, but viewers are about to be treated to something you just don't see enough of on Aussie TV: A nude wrestling match.

In tonight's episode, the two tribes - Asaga and Samatu - go head to head in a reward challenge, competing to win a simple tool that'll make life much easier on the island.

One member from each tribe had to get themselves wet then tear down a slip-and-slide, trying to grab a ball at the end of the track. The first contestant to grab hold of the ball and bring it to their team's square on the course would win a point.

Two of this season's most physically impressive competitors, 195cm tall mountaineer Locky and former SAS commander Mark, are paired off to compete against each other.

As they careen down the slip-and-slide - Locky clad only in his jocks - Mark reaches for his competitor's sole item of clothing in an attempt to hold him back. All at once, off come the undies.

"Locky gets there first! He loses his shorts! It's now X-rated! Locky's completely naked!" shouts host Jonathan LaPaglia.

The poor Ten censor certainly earns their pay in this scene, struggling to keep up with a very large man squirming his naked frame this way and that:

Uh, Locky - you're naked and you're nowhere near the ball.Channel 10

As the ugly wrestling match continues, Locky's team mates go through a variety of emotions at the sight of their fellow competitor in his birthday suit:

In the end, Locky wins - thank god - and his team mates rushed to congratulate him. None seem to be in that much of a hurry to fetch him his underpants, though.

He won! But in the end, aren't we all winners?Channel 10

As Locky lies in the sand exhusated, LaPaglia has the final word: "Nice cheeks."
