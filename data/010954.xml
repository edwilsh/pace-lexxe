  <title>Radio Birdman doco to fly into Thirroul</title>
  <content>
A documentary on legendary Australian band Radio Birdman will hit the screen at Anita's Theatre later this month.

Thirroul will get a taste of Radio Birdman via a screening of a documentary on the iconic Australian band.

Descent into the Maelstrom took filmmaker and fan Jonathan Sequiera more than two years to complete.
"It's a really good underdog story," Sequiera said.

"They really had this huge cultural effect on music and people in Australia. The band really mattered and really changed things because they did things themselves.

"They had this 'no compromise attitude and people were inspired, not just by the music but also by what Radio Birdman achieved."

There is a oft-cited undercurrent of tension within the band, all of whom were involved with the film.
"The tension between the members, I suppose is because they're all creative people and passionate about what they were doing," Sequiera said.

"So that's natural and that tension drives something bigger."

The film screens at Anita's Theatre on August 16.
