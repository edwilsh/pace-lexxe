  <title>Garard's big lift at CrossFit titles</title>
  <content>
HIGHLY-rated CrossFit athlete Ricky Garard has missed out on a ticket to the world games in the US after the Pacific titles in Wollongong.

Lift: Ricky Garard competes at the Australian Crossfit titles.
Garard was just two points shy of a top five finish in the  seven-event contest, which includes squat snatches, pull ups, running, rowing, hand stand walks, burpees, rope climbs, sit-ups, deadlifts, handstand walks and muscle ups. "I prepared myself as well as I possibly could for this event and competed to my best ability," Garard said.

"While I missed out on a place in LA, I am stoked to have made the Pacific event."

During competition, Garard achieved a personal record on a squat snatch by nine kilograms.

Coach and brother Ben Garard, who qualified for the Los Angeles world titles last year, praised the standard of competition.
"It takes heart, ferociousness and a massive desire and will to compete at this level of CrossFit and Ricky displayed all those characteristics and more in Wollongong," Ben said.
