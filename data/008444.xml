  <title>Choose culture over cash: Walker to Lever</title>
  <content>
Adelaide captain Taylor Walker hopes his sought-after teammate Jake Lever chooses culture over cash.
Lever, who falls off-contract with the Crows at season's end, has reportedly met with officials from Melbourne.Photo:  AAP
"Is there? It's probably a decision for Jake to make," Walker said on Wednesday, of the reports.
"I would like to think that we create an environment and culture that when it comes for him to make his decision, then it's the right one and he wants to stay at our footy club."
Lever has said he may not make a decision on his future until the end of the season, with the Demons and Western Bulldogs pitching multi-million dollar long-term deals.
Adelaide's offer is reportedly well under the rival bids but Walker took aim at AFL great Wayne Carey for saying the Crows were renowned for low-balling contracts.

"It's an interesting comment. Does he do our books, does he," Walker said.
Lever's teammate Mitch McGovern also is yet to recommit to Adelaide beyond this season amid interest from his home state of Western Australia.
Walker said the 22-year-old McGovern and Lever were "just like every other player - they are super-important to our side".
