  <title>Yancoal plans $2.5 Billion raising for Rio coal mines</title>
  <content>
China-backed Yancoal Australia will raise $US2.5 billion ($3.1 billion) in equity to fund the purchase of Rio Tinto Group's Australian coal assets, with its parent Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. tipping in $1 billion.
Under the arrangement announced on Tuesday, Glencore, which will jointly operate some of Rio's Coal & Allied operations in the Hunter Valley with Yancoal, will contribute $300 million.

"The strategic acquisition of Coal & Allied will redefine our position within the global coal marketplace and strengthen Yancoal Australia for the future," Yancoal Chairman Xiyong Li said in a statement Wednesday.
Investors in Yancoal responded to the news by wiping 35.9 per cent from its share price taking it to 25 cents when it emerged from a four-day trading halt.
The deal will catapult Yancoal into Australia's largest pure-play coal producer and give it a stake in the owner of two terminals at the port of Newcastle, the country's main conduit for thermal coal.
It comes at a time when major consumers including China plan to curb use primarily due to environmental concerns.

Rio agreed to sell its Australian coal mines for $US2.69 billion to Yancoal, a unit of China's state-run Yanzhou, in June after a protracted battle with Glencore.
Rio chose Yancoal because its offer was seen as having fewer regulatory hurdles despite some uncertainty over its financing of the deal.
On July 27, Glencore announced a surprise $US1.1 billion deal with Yancoal for a stake in the coal assets in Australia's Hunter Valley.
â€‹The backing of Yanzhou, China's fourth-biggest coal producer, and two Chinese investment funds means the financing side of the deal looks solid despite Yancoal's modest market capitalisation of about $A400 million, according to Fat Prophets resources analyst David Lennox.
"If things went sour, there would be some back room negotiating" to help secure the terms of the transaction.
Chinese state-owned Yanzhou owns 78 per cent of the Australian Securities Exchange-listed company with Asian commodity trader Noble Group Ltd. holding a 13 per cent stake.

The Australian Financial Review quoted a spokesman as saying the deal was under review and a challenge was likely as it would heavily dilute Noble.
Hong Kong-based hedge fund Senrigan Capital Group said in June it was concerned by the size of the financing needed for Yancoal's Coal & Allied deal as well as the impact a planned equity raising would have on the value of stakes held by minority shareholders.
