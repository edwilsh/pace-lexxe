  <title>Crown Resorts profits hit by VIP revenue fall after China arrests</title>
  <content>
James Packer's Crown Resorts has been hit by a fall in VIP gambling revenue, suffering double-digit profit and revenue falls for the 2017 financial year.
Crown also announced a share buy-back worth about $375 million on Friday.
The casino and entertainment giant recorded normalised net profit after tax of $343 million from revenue of $3.24 billion, down 15.65 per cent and 10 per cent respectively from the previous year.
Crown's VIP program revenue fell from $1 billion in 2016 to about $605 million.

"Crown's Australian operations' full year result reflected difficult trading conditions," said executive chairman John Alexander.

"Total normalised revenue across Crown's Australian resorts declined by 12.7 per cent. This decline was due primarily to the reduction in VIP program play revenue in Australia, which was down 48.9 per cent on the prior comparable period."
Crown made a net gain of about $1.75 billion on the sale of its Melco Crown shares throughout the financial year.
The company was hit by the arrest of 18 employees and associates in China last October,
Mr Packer officially re-joined the Crown board on Thursday, with Guy Jalland also being named director.
