  <title>Teen seriously injured after assault with bollard outside Bendigo nightclub</title>
  <content>
A teenager was knocked unconscious and two bouncers were last night attacked outside a Bendigo club, with the men responsible still at large.
The incident happened after the two attackers were ejected from Pall Mall nightclub Universal just after 1am.
The pair grabbed hold of metal bollards used for crowd queue control and began to assault two bouncers.
The men then hit out at a club patron, a 19-year-old Bendigo man, who was leaving the club at the same time.
The teenager was struck to the face, causing him to fall to the ground and strike his head on the road.
The unconscious victim was taken to hospital with a serious head injury.
Investigators are looking for the two men, who they believe may have been part of a larger group inside the club prior to the incident.
Police are urging anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit a confidential crime report at www.crimestoppersvic.com.au
