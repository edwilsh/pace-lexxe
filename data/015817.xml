Hugh Greenwood has re-signed with the Crows

FORMER elite basketballer Hugh Greenwood has re-signed with the Crows, contracting himself to Adelaide until at least the end of 2019.

Greenwood, 25, has played nine games this year for Adelaide in a remarkably successful mid-career change of sports.

"I'm really excited to see what's going to happen over the next couple of years, and I'm very thankful as well. The footy club has given me another opportunity," Greenwood said.

"It's a very positive environment and I think we're built for success."
