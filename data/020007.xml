  <title>Casualty ward: Ross breaks back, avoids surgery</title>
  <content>
NEWCASTLE fullback Nathan Ross has been diagnosed with a fractured back following their NRL win over the Warriors on Saturday.
came at a heavy cost with the fan favourite going down with what appears to be a serious injury.
Ross was hospitalised and taken for scans after copping an accidental knee from Blake Ayshford with the club giving no timeline for his recovery.
"He was taken to hospital for scans, which confirmed a fracture of the L1 transverse process," the club said in a statement.
"Ross' injury will not require surgery."
Ross has been one of the club's best performers this year and his absence will leave the Knights with a gaping hole to fill with four games remaining.
Peter Mata'utia filled in at fullback during the second half against the Warriors while Dane Gagai has also played on occasions in the No.1 jumper over the last three seasons.
ROUND 22 NRL CASUALTY WARD

BULLDOGS V EELS
Bevan French (hamstring) didn't make it back after half time. Tepai Moeroa (ribs) was a pre-game withdrawal.
DRAGONS V RABBITOHS
Josh Dugan (ankle) came off in the 24th minute. "It looks pretty bad at the minute," coach Paul McGregor said after the match. "It's syndesmosis, so we'll have to have a look in 48 hours when that swelling goes down. But it's not good at the minute." Russell Packer (knee) was a pre-game withdrawal and he is set to miss another fortnight. Jake Marketo (dangerous contact) can escape suspension with an early guilty plea.
COWBOYS V STORM
Gavin Cooper (calf) and Antonio Winterstein (hamstring) are facing extended stints on the sideline. Scott Bolton (elbow) played on due to lack of interchanges but is also in doubt for next week. Kane Linnett (dangerous contact) can escape suspension with an early guilty plea.
KNIGHTS V WARRIORS
Nathan Ross (fractured back) is out for the season. David Fusitu'a (concussion) failed a test and didn't return.
TITANS V BRONCOS

NRL: Joe Ofahengaue might be spending a few weeks on the sideline after this one.

Bronco's ugly spear tackle
Ashley Taylor (knee) came off with a minor injury when the game was well out of reach. "He's got a medial problem. I don't think it's too serious. He was certainly inconvenienced and we had Tryone (Roberts) sitting there. Hopefully he'll be OK but he could miss next week." Kevin Proctor (hamstring) was a pre-game withdrawal. Joe Ofahengaue (dangerous throw) is facing a long suspension.
SHARKS V RAIDERS
Jack Bird (shoulder) came from the field late with a dislocation. He was playing his first game back from a sternum injury.

NRL: Braith Anasta and Michael Ennis discuss an injury Jack Bird sustained during Cronulla's loss to Canberra.
