  <title>Qantas flights QF7 to Dallas and QF63 to Johannesburg return to Sydney due to mechanical issues</title>
  <content>
Two Qantas flights have had mid-air issues after leaving Sydney this afternoon with both returning to the airport.
Flight QF7 to Dallas was returning after experiencing a mechanical issue, Qantas said.
The flaps on the Airbus A380 were unable to retract, which meant the plane could not fly efficiently, a statement from the airline said.
As the Dallas route is the longest in the Qantas network, the captain made the decision to turn around and return to Sydney.
The aircraft is expected to land in Sydney soon and undergo inspections by engineers.
Another flight, QF63 to Johannesburg, returned to Sydney this afternoon after experiencing an engineering issue.
The aircraft, a Boeing 747-400, landed safely and Qantas said its issue was unrelated to the issue onboard QF7.
Qantas said it was working to accommodate affected passengers or offer them transport home before replacement services were organised.
