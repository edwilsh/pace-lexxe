  <title>Diamonds of Swing show highlights big band-era sound</title>
  <content>
SOPHISTICATED, sexy and sassy - just a few of the superlatives often used to describe the female vocalists known as the "canaries" of the swing band era.
These canaries - legendary female stars including Billie Holliday and Ella Fitzgerald - were thrust into the spotlight, fronting the big bands with the 1940s sound.
Sunshine Coast Jazz Club will present Diamonds of Swing in tribute to their voices and sound.
This show has been written and produced by Brisbane jazz vocalist Jan Lennard who will be joined on stage by popular big band singer Di Clark.
They will be supported by a four-piece band of highly professional Brisbane musicians.
The show has had sell-out success in the past at the Brisbane Jazz Club.
Lennard has an extensive musical resume and repertoire - feeling equally at home vocally when performing jazz, Latin and blues, pop, country, rock'n'roll and stage musical numbers.
She has been the lead singer with the Redlands Big Band for more than five years.
Clark is considered one of Brisbane's best big band singers.
She has sung in venues in the United Kingdom and Prague in the Czech Republic, as well as with a variety of bands in Brisbane.
Together, these women will highlight the wonderful big band singers from a bygone era, their musical journey and most recognisable songs for the audience to dance or hum along to and enjoy.
The show is on Sunday, August 20, at the Caloundra Power Boat Club's Pelican Room.
Doors open at 12.30pm for the 2pm start.
Cost of the afternoon's entertainment is: members $20, non-members $25 seniors / U3A $22.50.
