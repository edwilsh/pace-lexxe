  <title>Dad 'pointed gun at daughter, 4'</title>

A SYDNEY man has caught on camera pointing a pistol at his four-year-old daughter, police allege.
Detectives say the man, who is charged over an illegal firearms cache, pointed a 45 calibre pistol at the girl and pulled the trigger, before allowing the child to play with the high-powered weapon.
The 32-year-old Revesby man was today charged with six offences including four counts of illegal firearm possession, allowing an unauthorised person to possess a firearm, and possession of child abuse materials.
Police seized a number of weapons including a 25 calibre Walther TP-model pistol, two Colt 1911 .45 calibre automatic pistols, and a Bentley 12-gauge shotgun, from two addresses at Revesby and Granville.
While investigating, detectives from Strike Force Bowser uncovered video shot on a mobile phone which allegedly shows the man pointing one of the Colt .45 handguns at his four-year-old daughter before pulling the trigger.
The weapon did not discharge, police say.
The video also allegedly shows the little girl playing with the automatic pistol and pulling the trigger, again without effect.
Senior police have condemned the alleged behaviour.
"Allowing a child to play with a firearm of any kind is reprehensible and is a serious criminal offence," Assistant Commissioner Mark Murdoch said.
The man has been remanded in custody and will appear in Burwood Local Court on Wednesday August 16.
