  <title>Donald Trump fires Anthony Scaramucci as communications director</title>
  <content>
US President Donald Trump has decided to remove Anthony Scaramucci from his job as communications director after just 11 days, hours after swearing in new chief of staff John Kelly.
"Mr Scaramucci felt it was best to give chief of staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team," a White House statement said.
"We wish him all the best."
General Kelly reportedly requested his dismissal.
More to come.
