Nakia Cockatoo strained his hamstring against the Blues

GEELONG is yet to determine exactly how long electrifying youngster Nakia Cockatoo will miss with an injured hamstring, but doesn't expect him to be available for at least "the next few weeks."

The 20-year-old kicked three goals in his return from persistent hamstring trouble against Carlton before he once again injured himself in the last quarter after exploding from a pack.

Cats football manager Steve Hocking told K-Rock the injury was serious enough to ensure time is taken considering the best course of action. 

"He'll certainly miss the next few weeks, but how long that'll be, we haven't confirmed," Hocking said.

"There's a seriousness around length of time and damage done to the hamstring."

Cockatoo hurt his hamstring in round nine against the Western Bulldogs before injuring it again early in the game against West Coast.

He then missed five weeks before returning against the Blues and performed well before the injury.

Meanwhile Hocking also confirmed Lincoln McCarthy would miss the rest of the season as he goes in for hip surgery after missing a large chunk of the year with groin problems.

McCarthy will visit a specialist in Tasmania the surgery to help kickstart his promising career again. The 23-year-old is contracted for 2018.
