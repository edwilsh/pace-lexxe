A 53-year-old gambling addict has been sentenced to life in jail with a 22-year minimum for the murder and dismemberment of his best friend in a crime a Perth judge said "defies comprehension".
In August last year, David John Napier used a hammer to bludgeon to death 70-year-old Richard Andrews after he refused to lend Napier $100.
Napier then used an axe and a hacksaw to cut up the body, to try to ensure it could not be identified.
He initially stored the parts in plastic bags in a shed at his Orelia home, but he later disposed of them in bushland around Gidgegannup and Dwellingup.
Napier then "plundered" his friends savings and told lies to his neighbours, saying Mr Andrews had gone on holiday to Albany.
Napier was arrested six weeks later and in an interview with police initially denied doing anything to Mr Andrews.
However, when he was told there was going to be a forensic examination of Mr Andrews' unit, he confessed.
'Your crimes defy comprehension'

During a sentencing hearing today, Supreme Court Justice Bruno Fiannaca told Napier: "To ordinary decent people, your crimes defy comprehension."
"You appeared to be a mild-mannered, middle-aged man, but in an instant turned into someone capable of monstrous behaviour.
"You desecrated [your victim's] body in the most horrific way, and he was someone who had shown you kindness."
Justice Fiannaca said it was "unlikely" the killing was simply over $100, saying it appeared Napier had decided Mr Andrews' friendship was no longer of value to him and "removing him" from the world was a way of dealing with his own financial problems.
He took into account the fact Napier had eventually cooperated with police and had tried to help them locate Mr Andrews' body parts.
However, Justice Fiannaca said the way in which Napier dealt with Mr Andrews' body, "placed the offending in a category with which there was little comparison".
Napier's sentence was backdated to the time of his arrest in September last year, meaning he will be first eligible for release in 2038, when he is 74 years old.
