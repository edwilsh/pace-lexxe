  <title>Soccer club heist teens caught on camera</title>
  <content>
A TRIO of teens who broke into a Coast soccer club have been reminded of the hard work volunteers put into such community organisations.
One of the trio, Dale Ian William Hurrell, had the support of former Sunshine Coast deputy mayor Chris Thompson, who sat in the Maroochydore Magistrates Court gallery while the three were sentenced on Thursday.
The other two, Tyler Rycroft-Hart and Isaac Samuel Villani, were also supported in court.
Hurrell, Rycroft-Hart and Villani all pleaded guilty to breaking into the Maroochydore Soccer Club on June 15.
Police prosecutor Senior Constable Stu Lydford said entry was gained to the clubhouse about 8.30pm by removing louvres.
Snr Const Lydford said the three had tried to disguise themselves with hats.
CCTV images of the three were shown in court.
The court heard Hurrell had stood watch while Rycroft-Hart and Villani broke in.
They fled after an alarm went off.
Snr Const Lydford said a witness saw a car near the club a few hours earlier and due to previous break-ins had written down registration details.
Police followed up on those details the next day, leading to the three 17-year-olds being charged.
Villani, who represented himself, said it was a stupid mistake.
Duty lawyer Andrew Berneville-Claye represented Hurrell and Rycroft-Hart.
He said the three had been skateboarding nearby before deciding to break in.
"They went in there to steal food and some property," Mr Berneville-Claye said.
"It was very much a stupid prank."
Magistrate Haydn Stjernqvist said clubs like the soccer club existed on the goodwill and hard work of volunteers.
"These community organisations get very frustrated at this happening because they run on the smell of an oily rag and mainly the contributions of the members," Mr Stjernqvist said.
He put all three of them on nine-month good behaviour bonds and ordered each of them pay $413 restitution to the club.
No convictions were recorded.
