  <title>Oh deer! Merc written off in smash</title>
  <content>
A STRAY deer wandering across a road in Launching Place has caused a smash.
Yarra Junction Senior Constable Matt Ward said a Launching Place man in his 50s had his Mercedes Benz written off when he hit the deer on Dalry Rd about 9.30pm on Wednesday night.
Sen-Constable Ward said the deer ran onto the road in front of the man's car and the driver was unable to avoid the animal.
He said the deer was uninjured and ran off into bush.
The driver was shaken up but uninjured in the collision.
Sen-Constable Ward said it was the second crash involving a deer he had seen on the road in past 12 months.
He said the crash was a timely reminder for drivers to stay alert in the Yarra Valley at night.
"There's a lot of deer up here," he said.
"Obviously they are very large and they can cause a lot of damage."
