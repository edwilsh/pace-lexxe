THE miner who was injured in a workplace incident at the Goonyella Riverside mine on Saturday morning has died in hospital.

His wife, Carmela Xiriha Springer took to Facebook overnight Sunday, revealing the heartbreak of losing her best friend.
"Today I lost the love of my life, the person who has given me the second love of my life," Mrs Springer posted.
"My best friend and person who always said they loved my cooking even it was terrible ..."
Her post was met with an outpouring of condolences to the family of the miner with all devastated by the loss.
Facebook friend, Jake Tredwell, wrote: "My heart sunk last night when I heard that one of the biggest bloody legends of all time had been taken from us.
"Hands down one of the funniest blokes I've ever met and by far the most positive.
"I know you touched a lot of people brother and damn sure will be missed.
"Thoughts are with your family.
"See you on the other side Springer."
Emergency services were called to the mine about 1am Saturday morning.
BMA confirmed his death this afternoon.
