  <title>Pics to put your Instagram snaps to shame</title>
  <content>
The wonder of Mother Nature has been captured once again in this year's National Geographic Travel Photographer Of The Year Awards.
A photograph of an erupting volcano hit by a bolt of lightning has beaten thousands of other pictures to earn the snapper the top prize,  reports.
Sergio Tapiro Velasco from Mexico took his grand prize-winning photo, titled "The Power of Nature," outside Colima, Mexico.
For more than a decade, Velasco has been studying and photographing the Volcan de Colima, which is one of the most active volcanoes in Latin America and also known as the "Volcano of Fire."
Before he captured the picture, Velasco had been carefully tracking an increase in activity and closely watched the volcano for almost a month.
While shooting on a completely clear night just 7.5 miles away from the crater, Velasco heard a booming noise and witnessed the biggest volcanic lightning he'd ever seen, but until he reviewed the photos he'd taken, Velasco had no idea if he'd actually captured the spectacular event.
He said: "When I looked on the camera display, all I could do was stare - what I was watching was impossible to conceive, the image showed those amazing forces of nature interacting on a volcano, while the lightning brightened the whole scene."
In addition to the grand-prize winner,  - Nature, Cities and People - from more than 15,000 entries from participants in more than 30 countries.

National Geo's best travel snaps of 2017

PEOPLE, 3rd place: Rodney Bursiel/ National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year. "I recently traveled to Tavarua, Fiji to do some surf photography with pro surfer Donavon Frankenreiter at Cloudbreak. I'm always looking for new angles and perspectives. The usual surf shots have all been done so we decided to get a little creative. Makes you look twice."

CITIES, 3rd place: Photo by Misha De-Stroyev/ National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year. "This football field in Henningsvaer in the Lofoten Islands is considered one of the most amazing fields in Europe, and maybe even in the world. The photo was taken during a 10-day sailing trip in Norway in June 2017 and was captured via drone 120m up."

PEOPLE, Honorable mention. Photo by Michael Dean Morgan / National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year. "Besakih Temple has been known as Bali's 'Mother Temple' for over 1000 years and is perched 1,000 meters high on the southwestern slopes of Mount Agung."

NATURE, 3rd place. Photo by Tarun Sinha / National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year. "This image was captured in Costa Rica when I was travelling from Monteverde to Playa Hermosa. As you cross over this river, you can stop and peer over the edge of the bridge. Below, reside over 35 gigantic crocodiles, relaxing on the muddy banks of the river."

NATURE, Honorable mention. Photo by Shane Gross / National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year. "Caribbean reef sharks are usually shy so I placed my camera on a rock where I know they frequent and used a remote trigger to click away as they came in and bumped my camera around."

NATURE, Honorable mention. Yutaka Takafuji / National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year. "This photograph was taken in the evening hours of a humid early summer day in the forest of a small remote village in the Tamba area of Japan. It beautifully captures the magical atmosphere of princess fireflies."

CITIES, 1st place: Photo by Norbet Fritz/ National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year. "The modern interior of the city library in Stuttgart. with its wide-open space in the centre, where natural light comes from through the windows on the top - it has a very unique atmosphere where you can broaden your knowledge."

CITIES, Honorable mention. Al Ain: New city on the desert. Photo by Andrez Bochenski / National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year

CITIES, Honorable mention. Photo by Tetsuya Hashimoto / National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year. "This building is an apartment complex in Gifu Prefecture of Japan. It is very colorful, but it is an ordinary housing collective where ordinary people can live."

NATURE, Honorable mention. Photo by Reynold Riksa Dewantara / National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year. "Mount Bromo volcano is a small, but active volcanic cinder cone in Java, Indonesia. In early 2016, I happened to be in Mt. Bromo during the increase of seismic activity and triggered the alert status to the second highest."
