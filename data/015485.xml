  <title>Dinner sorted: New Italian beachside restaurant opens</title>
  <content>
FROM the Italian island of Sardinia, to Munich, Sydney and the Sunshine Coast, the journey to deliver authentic Italian food has been full of globe trotting for Sarah Masella and her family.
Their new restaurant, Cinque Terre Restaurant and Pizzeria has proven a winner with Sunshine Beach locals and visitors.
Ms Masella said they'd been close to capacity every night, since opening last Wednesday.
"It's good, dinner's really good," she said.
The family moved to Sunshine Beach from Sydney about a month ago and took charge of their new Duke St restaurant, underneath popular Embassy XO Restaurant and Bar.
Having operated restaurants in Sardinia and Munich, the family is well-versed in what makes for a pleasing Italian dining experience.
Sarah is manager, while her father is chef and her husband is in charge of the pizza making.
He used to run pizza making classes and she said they were considering starting those up again at their new Sunshine Beach venue.
"It's really nice here, we love it here," Ms Masella said of the move, after four years in Sydney.
"The weather's nice, the people are lovely.
"We want to stay here, we really like it."
She'd been a little surprised at the response, but added people were always eager to try out something new.
Regardless, she said some locals had dined there four times in the past week alone, telling them they were doing something right.
"We've had a lot of good feedback," Ms Masella said.
Handmade pastas, desserts and pesto are among the fares on offer, which have enticed some significant crowds, including bookings of up to 20 at a time in the first week.
She said they were offering takeaway food at the moment and were looking to partner with Menulog.
The restaurant is BYO and she said they had applied and were waiting for their liquor licence, but would remain BYO once that was secured.
Ms Masella said the spaghetti baccata had been a winner with diners so far.
