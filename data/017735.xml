  <title>Original Karate Kid back for new series</title>
  <content>
THE Karate Men?
Streaming service YouTube Red has ordered the series Cobra Kai, a continuation of the classic 1984 film The Karate Kid, with Ralph Macchio and William Zabka on board to reprise their roles as Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence.
Per , the 10-episode series landed at the streaming service after a bidding war with the likes of Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and AMC.
"The minute I heard about this project, I knew we had to have it. The Karate Kid became an instant classic in the 1980s, and still resonates with audiences around the world and on YouTube today," global head of original content for YouTube Susanne Daniels told Fox News.
"We're thrilled to partner with Sony TV, Overbrook and the talented writing team led by Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, and Hayden Schlossberg to add a fresh, new comedic twist on one of Hollywood's most storied rivalries," she added.
Set to premiere in 2018, Cobra Kai is described as a half-hour comedy that takes place 30 years after the All Valley Karate Tournament.
A down-on-his-luck Johnny decides to reopen the Cobra Kai dojo. Meanwhile, Daniel finds himself struggling without his mentor Mr. Miyagi (the late Pat Morita).
Soon enough, their one-time rivalry is reignited, and the two decide that the best way to deal with their feud is through - you guessed it - karate.
Josh Heald (of Hot Tub Time Machine), Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg (Harold and Kumar) will serve as writers on the series, with Macchio and Zabka on board as executive producers.
No word yet on who will direct the revival.
The original Karate Kid series was directed by Oscar-winner John G. Alvidsen,  after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.

RIP to my friend and KK director John G Avildsen. He brought inspirational stories to us all and had a guiding hand in changing my life.
The project hails from Will Smith's Overbrook Entertainment, which also developed the 2010 film remake starring Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan.
