  <title>Aussie star's surprise Game of Thrones cameo</title>
  <content>
EAGLE-EYED fans of Game of Thrones may have spotted a familiar Aussie face last night with Brendan Cowell popping up on the Emmy-winning series.
Cowell played Harrag, the grizzled guy who scolded Theon Greyjoy when a sodden man was pulled out of the water.
Cowell is expected to appear in at least three episodes this season, so while he may have been on screen for only a minute in Monday night's episode, he'll likely have a bigger impact as the story around the defeated Greyjoy fleet unfolds.
Cowell is best known to Australian viewers as Tom from Love My Way but has also had roles in Howzat! Kerry Packer's War, Beneath Hill 60, The Borgias and The Slap.

Cowell isn't the only Australian actor to have graced the screen on Game of Thrones.
Essie Davis played Lady Crane, the actor Arya tried to save in Braavos last season while Noah Taylor was in eight episodes of season three and four as Locke, a soldier loyal to House Bolton.
