  <title>Police announce search for ACT prisoner two days after his escape from custody</title>
  <content>
ACT police have warned the public not to approach a man who escaped from custody while being taken to Canberra Hospital for treatment on Saturday.
Jonathon Hogan, 23, was taken to hospital after a court appearance relating to drug offences and resisting police.
However, he was able to evade custody and escape the building.
He was last seen about 8:30pm on Saturday.
Police announced the escape on Monday afternoon, warning Canberrans not to approach Hogan.
A spokeswoman for ACT Policing was not immediately able to say why there was a 45-hour delay between his escape and when it was made public.
Hogan is thin and of Indigenous appearance, about 180cm tall and has dark eyes and hair.
He also has distinctive tattoos: The name or names "Ricki Rose Murray" on his right forearm, and the name "Ricki" on his left forearm.
Police said anybody who recognised Hogan should contact them at once.
