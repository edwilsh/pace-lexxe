A former Catholic priest has appeared briefly in a Melbourne court via video link facing historical sex charges dating back to the 1970s.
Frank Klep, 74, is facing four charges of indecent assault against a male, with the alleged offences occurring between 1976 and 1982 while he was a priest and teacher at Salesian College Rupertswood at Sunbury.
The matter was adjourned in Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Monday, with Klep due to reappear via video link on August 25.
