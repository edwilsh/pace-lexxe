  <title>Can Oates force his way into side?</title>
  <content>
BRONCOS winger Corey Oates will this morning be given his last chance to prove his fitness, as the towering back pushes to make his return from a serious staph infection.
Oates was named 18th man by coach Wayne Bennett on Tuesday but if he manages to get through today's final training run at Red Hill, he will be brought into the 17 for tomorrow's derby against the Titans.

It will be a major boost for the Broncos, who have been missing their star winger since June.
The Broncos were unsure last month how long it would take Oates to make his return, but he has passed all tests so far, with today to be his final hurdle.
