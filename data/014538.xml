A second plot related to the building of an improvised chemical dispersion device to release colourless toxic gas.
"This is one of the most sophisticated plots that has ever been attempted on Australian soil," Australian Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan said on Friday.
On Thursday night, the  Mahmoud Khayat, 32, and Khaled Mahmoud Khayat, 49, each with two counts of acting in preparation for or planning a terrorist act.
Both men are scheduled to appear in Parramatta Court on Friday morning. The maximum penalty each could face is life imprisonment.

Mr Phelan said there was "conjecture" as to why the IED was not placed on the flight on July 15 but said at no stage did the device make its way into the secure section of the airport.
"At no stage did the IED breach security," he said.
"The IED was sent through international cargo. With assistance from the ISIL commander, the accused assembled the IED - so the components of the IED, into what we believe was a functioning IED to be placed on that flight."
