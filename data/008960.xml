  <title>Uber levy still possible in WA: premier</title>
  <content>
An Uber passenger levy remains a possibility in Western Australia, the premier says.
Mark McGowan expects an announcement to be made after the budget is handed down in September.
"That may well happen, that's what's happened in other states," Mr McGowan told 6PR radio on Wednesday.
"We have to make sure that we're fair on the taxi industry, and in particular, I want to be fair on small business people."
Earlier this year, Transport Minister Rita Saffioti described the taxi industry as a mess, and said a lot of drivers were still hurting after ride-sharing companies were made legal in WA.
She asked the Department of Transport to develop funding models for a taxi plate buyback scheme, which could potentially be funded by an Uber fee levy.
