  <title>Surviving 'Rat of Tobruk' Bill Corey celebrates 100th birthday in Adelaide</title>

Bill Corey has been called many things over his long life: husband, father, gentleman.
Now he's added another title, centenarian.
Today is his 100th birthday and, not surprisingly, it's prompted a moment of reflection.
"Looking back I wouldn't have missed anything," Mr Corey said.
"But I wouldn't like to go through it again."
The 'it' he casually refers to is World War II.

Like millions of young men, some from big cities and others from little country towns - Mr Corey first grew up in Riverton - he spent his 20s fighting in the war.
"The uniform made us the same. We got on so well," Mr Corey said.
"Rich or poor, the lesson I learnt from that is everyone has got some good in them, if it's allowed to come out."
But Mr Corey also lost a large chunk of his youth.
"Every part of your life is important," Mr Corey said. "But your 20s are special. I missed that as a civilian."
Mr Corey saw action in New Guinea and Borneo.
"I've always stated that I didn't have any effects from the war, but of course I did. You don't realise it but it has to have an effect," he said.
"The last few years, all these things come back and I still have a few little cries when I think about it ... but you've got to get on with life and be positive."
Siege of Tobruk a proud moment for Australia

It was Mr Corey's efforts in Africa that earnt him most acclaim.

In 1941, German General Edwin Rommel's crack Afrika Korps laid siege to the Libyan port city of Tobruk.
Just 14,000 Australians held the strategically vital spot.
If they had failed, eminent war historian Professor Trevor Wilson said the consequences would have been disastrous.
"It was assumed by the Germans and I think possibly by the British as well that Rommel would take Tobruk," Professor Wilson said.
"It's the Suez canal that Rommel was out to get and he's got practically all of North Africa, except Tobruk."
The Germans were so cocky they dubbed the Australians "rats caught in a trap".
Being Australian, the soldiers turned it into compliment, and dubbed themselves the Rats of Tobruk.
Mr Corey told the ABC in 2012 his most enduring memory of Tobruk place was the ever present dust.
"You ate, slept, drank everything in the dust and if there was a dust storm you still ate and drank your meal in the dust," he recalled with a laugh.
"Sometimes when you got to the bottom of your cup of tea, it was muddy."
Only a handful of the Rats are still alive.

A birthday celebrated at Government House

It's fitting the digs in which Mr Corey's 100th birthday was celebrated are far more salubrious than Tobruk.
There are no dusty tea cups in SA's Government House.
Governor Hieu Van Le quipped the splendid sponge birthday cake, topped with raspberries and strawberries, was just a little something "whipped up" earlier.
But there were serious reflections as well.
The Governor came to Australia as a refugee from the Vietnam war.
"I had firsthand experience of the brutality and destruction that war brings," he said.
"But I also saw the gallantry and bravery of our soldiers in the battlefield and Bill is one of those ... people who are prepared to sacrifice themselves for the sake of others. To me that makes him an absolute hero."
Of the many words used to describe Mr Corey, hero is the one that leaves him shaking his head.
"Oh no, no, I only see myself Bill ... I don't kid myself that I am anyone."
The essence of heroic understatement.
