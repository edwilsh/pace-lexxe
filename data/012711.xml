TWO men have been charged with terrorism offences following an alleged plot to bring down a commercial flight.
The NSW Joint Counter Terrorism Team has charged a 49-year-old Lakemba man and a 32-year-old Punchbowl man with two counts each of acts in preparation for a terrorist act.
The maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment.
Both men are scheduled to appear at Parramatta Court tomorrow morning.
It comes after four men were arrested on Saturday. A 50-year-old man was released from police custody on Tuesday, 1 August, without charge. One man remains in custody.
Police have searched six addresses across Sydney this week.
Members of the community are advised to report suspicious activity to the National Security Hotline on 1800 123 400.
