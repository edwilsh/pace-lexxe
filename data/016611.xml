The opening ceremony for this year's Garma festival has been filled with hope for action on reconciliation and coloured by a moving memorial for acclaimed Indigenous musician Dr G Yunupingu.
Yolngu leader and land rights champion Galarrwuy Yunupingu officially opened the Garma Festival by imploring politicians to take action on constitutional change for Indigenous Australians.
"You will know that at Uluru we started a fire. A fire that we hope burns bright for Australia," he said.
"This is the perfect place for us to find our path to a settlement. Our wayawu - our pathway through the bush."
In May, Indigenous leaders from across the country released the Uluru Statement of the Heart calling for a body for First Nations people to be constitutionally enshrined in Parliament and as well as a treaty.
Both federal leaders said they wanted to use Garma to pave a way forward for reconciliation.
Mr Turnbull began by addressing the crowd in Yolngu, the language for many communities in Arnhem Land.

"The relationship between our nation and our First Peoples is a deeply complex one. But it's not static, it isn't frozen in time," Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said.
"It's forever growing and changing and our journey of reconciliation is made up of many steps, practical and symbolic.
"So, as we build a greater understanding between First Nations and the broader community, as festivals like this do so well, we know that from little things big things grow."
The theme of this year's Garma Festival is 'Makaratta' - a dispute resolution ceremony to create peace which has been practised by Yolngu people in Arnhem Land for tens of thousands of years.
Aboriginal and Torres Strait leaders wanted this ancient resolution process to once and for all create constitutional change for First Nations people at Garma.
Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said he wanted the festival to provide him and other politicians inspiration to settle that issue.
"I regard Garma as an opportunity to provide us in Canberra with inspiration," he said.
"To actually argue for a Makarrata Commission, for truth-telling, and for treaties. For getting going on a declaration by all of the parliaments and by enshrining an Indigenous voice in our constitution."
Dr Yunupingu tribute brings people to tears

The opening ceremony also paid tribute to  and hailed from a north-east Arnhem Land community on Elcho Island.
In a moving performance which brought many to tears, including the Prime Minister's wife Lucy Turnbull, Dr Yunupingu's family sang a tribute to the artist prompting politicians and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders to hold their hands in the air in his memory.
Dr Yunupingu's uncle Djunga Djunga Yunupingu said his nephew's music aimed to create reconciliation with Indigenous people.
"A wayawu is the pathway to a place of goodness that we cannot find," he said.
"We need you Mr Turnbull and Mr Shorten to help us find this wayawu - this place where we find unity."
"Two Laws. Two People. One Country. This was the work of my nephew Dr G Yunupingu who in his songs spoke to the nation in his own language, of himself as a Yolngu person and the land that he was born to."
Mr Turnbull also paid his respects to the late musician.
"We extend our condolence, as all Australians do, to the family of Dr G. He brought the language to all Australians. His music will be forever cherished," he said.
The festival will continue for the next three days and involve a number of forums on issues affecting Indigenous people including health, education, and the economy.
