International Air Transport Association codes (IATA) are used to identify airports. Often derived using letters from the name of the city the airport is located in, these three letter codes can be quite amusing.

How airports get their three-letter code names.

Share

SOME airport codes are pretty obvious and make logical sense, such as SYD for Sydney or MEL for Melbourne. But others? Not so much.
Why is PIE the airport code for St Pete-Clearwater International Airport in Florida? Or why is LAD the code name for Quatro de Fevereiro International Airport in Angola?
Or how on earth does an airport come to be known as POO, SEX, STI, COX or FUK? Yes, these are all legitimate airport codes.
Well it turns out there is a fairly reasonable explanation for how airports get their three-letter International Air Transport Association (IATA) codes, many of which are explained on Airport Codes.
In the case of PIE, St Pete-Clearwater International was previously called Pinellas International Airport, but with PIA already taken, it took its code from Pinellas County.
And while the name of Angola's Quatro de Fevereiro International Airport actually pays homage to February 4, an important national holiday in Angola, its airport code honours the capital city of Luanda.

Not all airports have logical codes, but there is method to the madness.Source:istock
SEX refers to Sembach Kaserne, which is a United States Army installation in Sembach, Germany. Its airport code comes from its former name as Sembach Annex.
POO is the airport code for Pocos de Caldas Airport in Brazil and gets its three-letter airport code from its home in the city of Pocos de Caldas.
COK is the code for Cochin International Airport in Kochi, India. Its airport pulls letters from its home city, Kochi, but reverses them.

What about all those airports with an "X" on the end - such as LAX, PHX, RIX, BHX and GRX? Before the 1930s, airports had two-letter codes. When codes switched to three letters, many added the letter 'X' to the end.
In addition, many airports also just use the letter 'X' to fill in when the desired letters are already taken.
The letter "X" isn't the only letter with a backstory. The letter "Y" also has significance when it comes to airport codes. With a few exceptions, airport codes starting with "Y" designate Canadian airports. This is because the U.S. National Weather Service initially established airport codes and Canada was allotted a "Y" for all airports associated with a weather office.
So because most airports are named after the home cities in which they live, or some derivative of that, that's why some of them end up with unfortunate names like POO or SEX. But that doesn't necessarily mean they like them.
Sioux Gateway Airport in Iowa has petitioned twice for its airport code, SUX, to be changed - it got its code because it resides in Sioux City. However, with no great alternatives they stuck with it and now just embrace it, coining the slogan "Fly SUX."
