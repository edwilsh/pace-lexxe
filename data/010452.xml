STEPHEN Curry didn't intend any disrespect, at least according to Steph Curry.
In an interview with The Athletic, Curry addressed the controversy surrounding his dancing - which - at Harrison Barnes' wedding on Saturday.
"I've been watching [the video of James dancing] twice a day since it happened because it's my favourite video in the entire world. He made a song popular by making a video. And that lives. So now every time I hear that song, that's all I think about. And I've been doing that dance because of him, at my house, at dinner. When something good happens, I pull that out, because I like it and it makes me laugh and it makes me happy. Not making fun of him."

The video of Curry sent waves throughout the NBA Internet, largely because Kyrie Irving was spotted in the video, laughing and encouraging Curry.
Irving, of course, reportedly requested a trade away from Cleveland in part because he wanted to get out of James' shadow.
Curry was quick to defend Irving, saying, "Obviously, that's a separate side story to their relationship, but neither one of us was trying to clown him."
If Irving is traded, the Knicks could be in the mix. They were reportedly on his list of preferred destinations along with the Heat, Timberwolves and Spurs.
However, if Carmelo Anthony refuses to waive his no-trade clause to go to Cleveland, as The Post has reported, it could be hard to put a deal together. According to The Post's Marc Berman, Anthony only wants to go to the Rockets.
