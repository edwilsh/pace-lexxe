  <title>Don't change the Brownlow rules: Lynch</title>

Patrick Dangerfield's suspension should not be a catalyst for changes to the Brownlow Medal, Tom Lynch says

THE CONTENTIOUS suspension of Brownlow Medal favourite Patrick Dangerfield shouldn't result in changes to the award's criteria, Adelaide forward Tom Lynch says.

There have been calls for players who have been suspended during the year to remain eligible for the game's highest honour, but Lynch said that would take away from the award's tradition.

"No, that's the thing that's made it so special," Lynch said.

"It's an award which is voted on by the umpires and that's the award.

"There are a lot of other awards - the coaches award that players can win - so you've got to follow by the rules."

Dangerfield has been ruled out of winning successive Brownlow Medals after he accepted a one-game ban for a tackle on Carlton ruckman Matthew Kreuzer.

"The rules are in place and everyone's got to follow them," Lynch said.

"We know Patty, he's a tough player - he plays the ball and he'll continue to do so.

"It's a tough one.

"Things happen around the ground really quickly, but we've got to follow the rules."
