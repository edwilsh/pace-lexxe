  <title>Canberra Raiders boss says NRL salary cap saga creating 'uncertainty' for clubs and players</title>
  <content>
Canberra Raiders chief executive Don Furner says the ongoing salary cap saga is not only making life difficult for NRL clubs, but creating uncertainty around players' futures as well.
There are reports up to 11 clubs could be forced to offload players if the final salary cap figure comes up short of where they've been working towards as negotiations continue to try and finalise a cap for next season and beyond.

Canberra keep slim finals hopes alive

The Raiders claimed a solid 32-18 victory over South Sydney.

It could be $9.2 million for a 30-man squad for the 2018 season, but it could be as low $8.8 million if a $400,000 integrity fund isn't included.
Some clubs had been working towards a $10 million cap.

The Raiders have already locked in their top 17 players for next year, with Joey Leilua, Jordan Rapana, Joe Tapine and Jack Wighton signed beyond 2018.
But with the salary cap still up in the air that means there's some uncertainty around who else the Raiders can lock in, which in turn clouds the future of those squad players.

Furner said until he knew what the final salary cap figure was and also who'd played in the Rugby League World Cup at the end of the year then he wouldn't know where the Raiders stood in terms of attracting and retaining anyone else.

"It's very, very difficult to predict at this stage because the salary cap hasn't been finalised and it's always difficult at the best of times, balancing a salary cap," he said.Photo: Colleen Petch
"It's probably extra difficult this time around because with the CBA going on and not knowing where we're at, but you don't really know where you're at until the end of the year when you work out who's earned what.
"There's a World Cup at the end of the year, guys get picked. That's what happened last year, a couple of guys got picked for New Zealand and Australia and bonuses kick in.
"You can't really determine it until it's all over ... it's hard for clubs to budget. It's also, in this year of the CBA, difficult for players."
But the Raiders' main focus is on Saturday night, when they travel to Shark Park to face third-placed Cronulla.
They need to win their last five games to have a chance of playing finals.
That run starts against the reigning premiers, who have found a way to win despite leading the NRL for errors made so far this season.
Raiders second-rower Josh Papalii's itching to get out there after serving a two-game suspension.
He said the Sharks were able to "defend their way out of trouble" and it was something the Raiders could take from the reigning champs.
"Sharks winning it last year, they can go into games pretty confident. They know how to defend their way out of trouble and also get themselves out of trouble as well," Papalii said.
"I really think they're doing a good job. Errors don't mean anything if you're still winning games."
, when the Sharks ran over the top of the Raiders to win 42-16 at Canberra Stadium.
Last year they fought out an epic qualifying final at the same venue, where the Raiders dominated the game early before the Sharks were able to pip them 16-14 on their way to the premiership.
It means the Raiders need to take their opportunities against a team like Cronulla, which boasts former and current State of Origin players like Paul Gallen, Luke Lewis, Andrew Fifita and Wade Graham.
"Their forward pack's pretty tough. Most of them are international and State of Origin players," Papalii said.
"With a young side like ours we've got to try and step up and try and match what they have.
"Last year's prelim I thought we got out to a great start and just didn't really carry on, but it's a new year and hopefully we can build on top of this game."
