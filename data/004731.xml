  <title>GST anger builds in WA but Scott Morrison says there's nothing he can do about fresh blow</title>
  <content>
Federal Treasurer Scott Morrison has ruled out intervening to stop Western Australia's GST share taking another $2 billion hit, saying his hands are tied over updated population estimates.
Following a meeting with his WA counterpart Ben Wyatt, Mr Morrison insisted there was nothing he could do about updated population estimates that could deplete the state's already strained finances even further.
WA Treasury has estimated the latest population data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics .
That is despite , a situation that has sparked ongoing anger in the west.
With Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in WA for the week, the McGowan Government had urged the Commonwealth to guarantee the state's GST share would not take another hit.
But Mr Morrison - who said he could not verify the $1.9 billion estimate - said he could not intervene.

"I have no legal ability to ignore the numbers of the chief statistician," Mr Morrison said.
"There is no flexibility on that."
Asked if the situation could see the Commonwealth make further top-up payments to WA, Mr Morrison indicated that was not on his radar - saying he was focused on .
"Rather than looking at the issues on the margin, we will stay focused on solving the main problem," Mr Morrison said.
"I'm looking to solve the central problem."
McGowan demands answers

The situation continued to draw an angry response from the State Government, with Premier Mark McGowan urging the Commonwealth to come to his state's aid.
Mr McGowan disputed the updated population figures because they came from the 2016 census - describing it as "flawed" after it was plagued by technological problems.
"If the Federal Government is not going to help us here, I want the Prime Minister to tell me to my face," Mr McGowan said.
"To lose $2 billion and have to write that into our budget in the coming weeks is a huge burden on West Australians."
The WA budget was already expected to remain in the red until at least 2019-20, with .
Mr Turnbull said he would discuss the matter with Mr McGowan during his week-long stint in WA, as he again defended his government's response to the GST situation.
"We are on the case there," Mr Turnbull said.
"I am the first Prime Minister to recognise there is an unfairness here and the first Prime Minister to describe a pathway to dealing with it."
Mr Turnbull will head to WA's south tomorrow to visit regional centres Albany and Busselton, before heading back to Perth and onto Broome later this week.
