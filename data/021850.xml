  <title>Authorities devise plan to dismantle crane which fell onto Sydney apartment block</title>
  <content>
Some residents have been allowed to return home following the collapse of a crane onto an apartment complex in Sydney's south, as authorities devise a strategy on how to remove it.
An investigation has begun into what caused the crane to collapse onto a unit block on Brodie Spark Drive at Wolli Creek on Sunday.
About 160 residents in the damaged building could be forced to spend another night in temporary accommodation.
However, another 300 people who lived in two surrounding blocks were allowed back home on Sunday night.
Three construction workers were taken to hospital for treatment after the accident, one with a suspected broken leg.
Structural engineers are assessing the damaged building.
Fire and Rescue NSW spokesman Superintendent Josh Turner said the crane was yet to be removed and the building's power was still out.
"The crane's been stabilised so it is safe for workers to actually get access," he said.
"Residents are still outside of the building as we have got power and gas cut off as some of that was damaged through the fall of the crane.
"So it is safe for workers to enter and a strategy is being developed to start dismantling the crane."
The Airport Line between Central and Turrella has reopened after being forced to close after the incident.
Call for ban on more cranes until inquiry complete

Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) NSW state secretary Brian Parker said early investigations indicated it was a mechanical or engineering fault with the crane that caused it to collapse.
"We are very, very concerned about this particular issue," he said.
"In this day and age, and all the expertise we have, it's not good enough.
"We have seen cranes catch fire, fall out of the sky, but not cranes that collapse onto buildings that have residents.
"Our fears are not just for the workers that work to erect these cranes, but also the public."
The CFMEU is calling for a stop on any further erection of cranes until investigations are complete.
"It could have been a major disaster here ... and we could have seen many lives lost," Mr Parker said.
SafeWork New South Wales has been notified of the incident.
High-rise residents fearful about living in tall buildings

Mary Broadley who lives in the unit block the crane struck said she thought the whole building was going to collapse when she felt it start to shake.
"It was so noisy, it was just unreal the noise," she said.
"I went to take a look and the crane was right outside the bedroom window."
She said the ceiling and walls of the bedroom had cracked and windows had smashed.
"It was so scary, I don't think I'll ever live in a tall building again," Mrs Broadley said.
Her husband Bill Broadley said it "was like a bomb going off".
