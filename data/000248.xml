Nick Riewoldt is expected to announce his retirement on Monday

ST KILDA has called a media conference for 2PM AEST on Monday, with speculation mounting that champion Nick Riewoldt will announce his retirement.

Riewoldt and fellow veteran Leigh Montagna are out of contract at the end of the season, and Montagna is also believed to be assessing his future.

Former captain Riewoldt was rested for last Saturday's agonising two-point loss to Port Adelaide as he deals with ongoing knee issues.

The media conference will be shown live on the AFL website and the AFL app.
