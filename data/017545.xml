  <title>Key Liberal seat voters back gay marriage</title>
  <content>
A majority of voters in six seats held by Liberal MPs - whose positions on marriage equality are undeclared - support same-sex marriage and a free vote in parliament, according to new polling.
However, Liberal voters in each seat are significantly less inclined to believe same-sex couples should be able to wed, or that the government should resolve the issue through a free parliamentary vote as soon as possible.
The ReachTel poll, commissioned by activist group GetUp, comes as Liberal MPs prepare for a special partyroom meeting in Canberra on Monday to discuss a way forward on the issue.
