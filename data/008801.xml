  <title>CAGE OF DEATH: Death-defying croc plunge to lure tourists</title>
  <content>
NORTH Queensland's CaPTA Group has reignited a plan to put tourists face-to-face with crocodiles in a beefed-up version of the Northern Territory's world famous Cage of Death.

Construction has started on the Wildlife Habitat's Crocarena at Port Douglas after the project hit roadblocks and failed to open a year ago.

Speaking at the Cairns ZOOM and Wildlife Dome, project manager Michael Woodward said the CaPTA Group expected the new attraction to open its jaws to particularly lion-hearted tourists early next year.

He also revealed a plan to build a new climbing wall to add to ZOOM's extensive high ropes course above the Reef Hotel Casino.

"At our sister attraction, Wildlife Habitat Port Douglas, we've got some grand plans. "There's the Crocarena ... we're submitting for grant funding for it as well."
