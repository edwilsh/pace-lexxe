  <title>Accused Bourke Street killer Dimitrious Gargasoulas fails to face court</title>

Accused Bourke Street killer Dimitrious Gargasoulas is absent from court again, days after a magistrate was told he was too mentally unwell to attend.

He also failed to appear in court last week.

The magistrate and prosecutor had no objection to Mr Gargasoulas not attending.
Tuesday's hearing lasted about two minutes.

Mr Gargasoulas was excused from attending court last week when his lawyer told another magistrate the 27-year-old was too mentally unwell to attend.

Mr Gargasoulas is accused of driving along Bourke Street about 1.30pm on January 20, deliberately striking pedestrians as the CBD teemed with lunchtime and school holiday crowds.
Six people - Japanese student Yosuke Kanno, father Matthew Si, schoolgirl Thalia Hakin, Sydney woman Jess Mudie, financial consultant Bhavita Patel and three-month-old baby Zachary Bryant - were killed.
Dozens more were injured.
Mr Gargasoulas was arrested by police after being shot and wounded by officers.
Mr Gargasoulas also faces a 29th attempted murder charge, a count of unlawful imprisonment and intentionally causing serious injury over two incidents that happened at Windsor before he drove into the CBD.
However, the case against him might not reach trial until 2019.
Mr Gargasoulas was due to face court last Thursday on charges unrelated to the Bourke Street tragedy.
That day, his other lawyer Tass Antos said his client was too mentally unwell to attend court.
"He has certain issues which are being explored in relation to his mental health and wellbeing," Mr Antos said.
"Bringing him to court or having him appear would not do his health any good."
The past two times Mr Gargasoulas has appeared before a magistrate, via video link in April and May, he made unprompted rants, which included declaring himself "the saviour" and not guilty, and claiming the Illuminati were to blame for the six deaths.
In June, the Supreme Court was told Mr Gargasoulas could plead that he is unfit to stand trial.
The court heard Mr Gargasoulas' lawyers were trying to have him assessed by mental health experts.
