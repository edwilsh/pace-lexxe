  <title>Gwynneville crash causing M1 traffic delays</title>
  <content>
Motorists heading home from work on Thursday afternoon are facing delays southbound after a multi-vehicle crash on the M1 Princes Motorway at Gwynneville. 
Initial reports suggest three vehicles are involved in the crash, which has closed two of three southbound lanes near the Mount Keira Road overpass. 
Meanwhile, another crash, understood to involve five vehicles, is reportedly affecting traffic on Memorial Drive near Porter Street.
More to come.
