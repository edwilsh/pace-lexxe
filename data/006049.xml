THE State Environment Department paid $58,000 for videos featuring local TV identity Andrew Costello to promote local nature sites.
Environment Minister Ian Hunter told an Estimates hearings in Parliament on Tuesday the department paid $58,437 to produce and use five segments filmed for the South Aussie with Cosi television show in a digital advertising campaign.
Mr Hunter said the videos were viewed by 46,000 people and prompted 857 reactions, 402 shares and 537 comments.
He said Mr Costello had "embarked on five different South Australian nature-based tourism areas and has produced programming around that".
The program is aired on Channel Nine.
"Our expenditure on him is related to utilising the copy or video or presentation that he produces... so that we could utilise it in terms of social media and other campaigns," he said.
Mr Hunter added that the payment was a "one-off arrangement and it has come to an end".
