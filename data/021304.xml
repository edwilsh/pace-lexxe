  <title>Do not take food or drinks that do not belong to you!!!</title>

I have sometimes wondered whose job it is to write the sign in the office kitchen: it must be in someone's position description, because I've never seen an office kitchen that doesn't have one.
The key selection criteria for this role include a demonstrated passive-aggressive personality disorder, a healthy disdain for English punctuation and no grasp whatsoever of the norms of typography.Photo: Passive Aggressive Notes
The main duties of the kitchen sign writer is to sticky-tape signs to the fridge or the microwave addressed to no one in particular but admonishing everyone in general: a good kitchen sign writer always assumes that colleagues are lazy, messy, ignorant and inclined to do bad in the fridge, not good.
Kitchen signs always seem to be typed in a MIX of UPPER and lower CASE for MAXIMUM IMPACT. If hand-written, they're in CAPITAL LETTERS ONLY.Photo: Supplied
The usual advice about using exclamation marks doesn't apply - you find them sprinkled liberally (and frequently in clusters).
The words "dishes" (as in, "these dishes won't wash themselves") should have an apostrophe in it; the word "won't" shouldn't.

Comic Sans can give the passive-aggressive tone of the message a lighthearted mask. Otherwise Arial or Times are the default typefaces. Anything else looks silly or pretentious.

There are a whole lot of stock signs, "reminding" people to wash the dishes, remove food from the fridge this week if you don't want the cleaners to throw it out and PLEASE CLEAN THE BLOODY SANDWICH PRESS AFTER USING.
Recently a colleague spotted a sign asking people not to eat other people's food from the fridge. Who would even do that? It literally takes the cake. You'd have to be a sociopath, or someone who grew up in a really, really big family where mealtimes were a free-for-all and if you didn't grab something from a sibling's plate while safeguarding your own, you probably didn't get enough to eat.
Or maybe there's just someone in that office who really, really needs a pay rise.
People who bring their lunch to work and leave it in the fridge are usually on some kind of FODMAP or gluten-free or whatever diet, or are trying to save money by stretching the weekend's leftovers way too far past hump day. Who wants that for lunch?
Come to think of it, without one of those signs about clearing the fridge out for the cleaners, who knows how long some of that stuff has been in there? Anything you find uneaten in the fridge after lunchtime has probably been in there since the last time the fridge cleaner came through.
