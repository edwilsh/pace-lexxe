Versatile tall Matt Hammelmann bagged four goals in the Brisbane Lions' 19-point win against Sydney at the Gabba on Saturday afternoon.

He also collected 12 disposals and five marks. 

Michael Close notched up 20 disposals and three goals and ruckman Archie Smith booted a a pair of majors.

Rohan Bewick finished with 27 disposals. 

Academy prospect Connor Ballenden had 12 disposals and two goals as the Lions won, 19.14 (128) to 15.19 (109).

This weekend: Northern Blues v Footscray - Saturday, August 5, 11am, Ikon Park

Former Giant Kristian Jaksch slotted four goals in the Northern Blues' 13-point loss to Footscray at Ikon Park on Saturday.

The right foot snap from the right forward pocket sails straight over the goal umpire! His fourth of the day.

Rhys Palmer collected 29 disposals while Ciaran Byrne had 27.

The Irishman came back from a knee reconstruction in June.

A 26-point lead at the final break was erased by the Dogs, who kicked six last quarter goals to win, 12.8 (80) to 10.7 (67).

State league affiliate: Collingwood (VFL)
This weekend: Werribee v Collingwood - Saturday, August 5, 3.45pm, Etihad Stadium 

Draftee small forward Kayle Kirby continued his push for a senior debut before the season is out, starring with five goals in the Magpies' 32-point win.

The 18-year-old, who was recruited with pick No.50 in last year's NAB AFL Draft, is the VFL's leading goalkicker this season with 38 goals from 14 games.

Kirby took strong pack marks in attack and was a genuine threat both in the air and at ground level.

Midfielder James Aish proved too classy through the centre along with draftee Callum Brown, who added a goal.

Fellow father-son recruit, forward Josh Daicos, took part in the match after recovering from a left foot injury he suffered in the first quarter last weekend, and also booted a goal.

Injured Collingwood captain Scott Pendlebury took on an assistant coaching role for the game. 

Things are looking good now. Kirby has FIVE goals! In case you're wondering, his career-best is SIX - against Sandringham earlier this year.

State league affiliate: Essendon (VFL)
This weekend: Bye 

State league affiliate: Peel Thunder (WAFL)
This weekend: Bye 

State league affiliate: Geelong (VFL)
This weekend: Box Hill Hawks v Geelong - Saturday, August 5, 2.10pm, Box Hill City Oval

Former North Melbourne forward Aaron Black slotted two goals in Geelong's 52-point loss to Box Hill at Box Hill City Oval on Saturday afternoon.

Rhys Stanley finished with one himself while defender Tom Ruggles had 20 disposals. 

Jordan Cunico, who made his AFL debut in round 10,  got through the match unscathed after missing over a month with an ankle injury.

Rookies Jermaine Jones and Jack Henry were named among the Cats' best as the Hawks led at every change to win 19.23 (137) to 13.7 (85).

Q3 |  keeps pressing, as Aaron Black pounces on a F50 turnover and snaps his 2nd for the term.

State league affiliate: Gold Coast (NEAFL)
This weekend: Bye 

State league affiliate: GWS Giants (NEAFL)
This weekend: Canberra v GWS Giants - Saturday, August 5, 12pm, Robertson Oval 

Experienced midfielder Tendai Mzungu was named the Giants' best, kicking two goals in the five-point loss.

Omitted ruckman Dawson Simpson also featured heavily and will get the call-up if No.1 ruckman Shane Mumford is suspended by the Match Review Panel for his two incidents against Melbourne on Saturday.

Simpson was joined by forward Daniel Lloyd (one goal) as the leading Giants, while Academy product Lachie Tiziani led the goalkicking for his side with three majors. 

State league affiliate: Box Hill Hawks (VFL)
This weekend: Box Hill Hawks v Geelong - Saturday, August 5, 2.10pm, Box Hill City Oval

Kade Stewart bagged four goals in Box Hill's comprehensive 52-point victory against Geelong at Box Hill City Oval on Saturday afternoon.

Tall forward Tyrone Vickery, who was named an AFL emergency this week, booted one.

Kieran Lovell and Kurt Heatherley were named among the best players as the Hawks cruised to the 19.23 (137) to 13.7 (85) win.

Q1 | Excellent work here by Vickery to hold his opponent off, & skid through his 1st major. with 3 against the breeze.

State league affiliate: Casey Demons (VFL)
This weekend: Sandringham v Casey Demons - Saturday, August 5, 2pm, Trevor Barker Beach Oval

Backman Joel Smith suffered a knee injury and was stretchered off the field in the first quarter of Casey's 10-point win against Sandringham at Trevor Barker Oval on Saturday afternoon. 

Hard nut Angus Brayshaw collected 34 disposals, while Jay Kennedy-Harris (39) and Ben Kennedy (33) also racked up plenty of the footy. 

The Demons overcame a 28-point deficit at half-time to win, 14.9 (93) to 12.11 (83).

What a win!! We win the last quarter against a five goal breeze to best  and consolidate our spot in the eight 🔴🔵.

State league affiliate: Werribee (VFL)
This weekend: Werribee v Collingwood - Saturday, August 5, 3.45pm, Etihad Stadium 

Defender Lachie Hansen looked dangerous at the opposite end of the ground, kicking a team-high three goals in his side's 32-point loss.

Small forward Jed Anderson kicked two majors, while second-year tall Ben McKay - the No.21 selection in the 2015 NAB AFL Draft - featured in defence and matched up on Collingwood's Lachlan Keeffe.

Lachlan Hansen dominated up forward in the 1st half - should have had 4 goals but gave one away in the goal square.

State league affiliate: Port Adelaide (SANFL)
This weekend: Port Adelaide v South Adelaide - Saturday, August 5, 2.10pm, Alberton Oval

Rookie Will Snelling performed a key role through the midfield in the Magpies' 32-point win, setting up his teammates with 24 disposals and 13 tackles - both team-highs.

Draftee Todd Marshall, the Power's first selection in last year's NAB AFL Draft at pick No.16, kicked three goals from his eight disposals, including back-to-back goals in the third quarter.

Young midfielder Brendon Ah Chee and key defender Logan Austin worked hard for 22 possessions apiece in the tough conditions. 

Todd Marshall edges  Magpies closer to a win with a great kick! A terrific mark by Marshall too!

State league affiliate: Richmond (VFL)
This weekend: North Ballarat v Richmond - Sunday, July 30, 11am, MARS Stadium

State league affiliate: Sandringham (VFL)

Jack Lonie responded well to his demotion from the senior side, racking up 34 disposals and slotting two goals.

Rookie Nick O'Kearney had 23 disposals.

Running hot Nick O'Kearney has 7 touches in the first 15 minutes & Rich gets our first!

The Zebras led by 28 points at the main break but were run over by Casey, 14.9 (93) to 12.11 (83).

State league affiliate: Sydney (NEAFL)

James Rose booted six goals to no avail as Sydney copped a 19-point defeat at the hands of the Brisbane Lions on Saturday afternoon at the Gabba.

Dumped youngster Daniel Robinson finished with 27 disposals to be his side's leading ball-winner, along with 2.3 on the scoreboard.

Aliir Aliir slotted a goal and backman Alex Johnson had six disposals.

The Lions led at every change in their 19.14 (128) to 15.19 (109) victory.

Big man Nathan Vardy played predominately as a forward in East Perth's 84-point win, finishing with 17 hit-outs, 12 disposals and two goals in his first appearance for the Royals.

The 26-year-old missed his first WAFL game of the season last week because of a glute strain.

Fellow tall Fraser McInnes was also a focal point in attack with two goals to go with his 19 hit-outs, 18 touches and eight marks.

Defender Sharrod Wellingham was moved into the centre at the start of the second term and had 23 disposals, six inside 50s and booted two goals of his own.

The Royals kicked 15 consecutive goals from late in the first quarter to set up the comprehensive win.

Meanwhile in the reserves, draftee Willie Rioli had 16 disposals and kicked three goals in his third game back from injury.

The cousin of Daniel and Cyril suffered a serious hamstring injury in February, before breaking down again in May.

The 22-year-old was drafted at pick No.52 from Glenelg in the SANFL last year.

Nathan Vardy clunks an uncontested mark in the goal square and picks up his second major of the day ⚫🔵 74 🔴🔵 23

State league affiliate: Footscray (VFL)
This weekend: Northern Blues v Footscray - Saturday, August 5, 11am, Ikon Park

Premiership player Josh Dunkley finished with 26 disposals, 12 tackles and a goal in his return from shoulder surgery in Footscray's comeback win against the Northern Blues by 13 points at Ikon Park on Saturday.

Veteran Matthew Boyd picked up the same tally while regular defender Fletcher Roberts was swung into attack for the final quarter and kicked a couple of crucial goals.

The Bulldogs overcame a 26-point deficit at three-quarter time to post the 12.8 (80) to 10.7 (67) victory.

GOAL. Roberts. His second of the last term.
