  <title>'What a story': Canberra man carjacked in broad daylight</title>
  <content>
Real estate agent Steve Thomas was finishing work in his car in Yarralumla on Thursday morning before doing a property appraisal up the road.
Suddenly, the driver's side door of his red Ford Mustang GT was flung open and a man was threatening Mr Thomas with a crowbar.Photo: Rohan Thomson
As the man told him to get out of the car, a second jumped into the passenger seat as Mr Thomas stepped out.
"He said 'get out of the f...ing car' twice. I was pretty calm, I said 'Mate, I'm getting out'," Mr Thomas said.
"I wasn't gonna fight three guys and a crow bar. I'm pretty sure he would've belted me in the head with it."
A third man was in another car they thieves had arrived in.

"So I was left standing there and the last thing I said to them was, 'Can you at least give me my phone?'," Mr Thomas said.
As they burned out and sped off, the thieves threw Mr Thomas' phone out the window before he used it to call police at about 9:55am.

Mr Thomas then went up to finish his property appraisal.
"It makes it the craziest appraisal I've ever done," he said.
The drama didn't stop there: the two thieves in the Mustang went to refuel at the service station off Canberra Avenue.
Unfortunately for them, a tactical police response unit happened to be at the service station and recognised the car.
They approached the offenders, one officer with a gun drawn, as one of the thieves punched one of the officers in the head before attempting to flee on foot.
Police tasered the man in the back and apprehended him as the second offender jumped back into the Ford and sped off.
Luckily for Mr Thomas, the car was found undamaged at around lunchtime in the nearby underground parking lot at Coles Manuka.
His car was returned to him with fingerprint dust still visible on the bonnet.
"What a story, unbelievable," Mr Thomas said.
Police said two of the suspects remained at large and they were working to find them.
