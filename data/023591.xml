  <title>Roosters top-four finish hopes hits snag as Daniel Tupou ruled out for six weeks</title>
  <content>
The Sydney Roosters' ambitions of a top-four finish have hit a hurdle after confirmation winger Daniel Tupou's NRL season could be over.
Scans on Monday showed Tupou suffered a groin tear in the second half of the Roosters' heavy loss to Manly and will be unavailable "for up to six weeks", the club said in a statement.

Manly's second-half comeback against Roosters

Reviving their NRL top four hopes with a 36-18 upset of Sydney Roosters at Lottoland.

With a month remaining in the regular season, Tupou could be out until the third week of the finals - provided the Roosters progress that far in September.
The news was better for forward Sio Siua Taukeiaho, who was cleared of a fractured finger in the first half at Lottoland and is a chance to take on Melbourne on Saturday.

But the loss of Tupou is a huge blow for a Roosters side already missing fullback Michael Gordon and co-captain Jake Friend, however the hooker is expected back to take on the Storm.

The Roosters are currently second on the ladder on 32 points - just two ahead of Brisbane, Cronulla and Parramatta in what is shaping as a tense battle for the crucial top-four spots.
