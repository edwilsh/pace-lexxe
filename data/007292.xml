  <title>PHOTOS: Adobe has moved into a colourful new London office with a 150m rooftop running track</title>
  <content>
US software giant Adobe has opened a colourful new office in London with a 150m rooftop running track and table tennis tables.

Adobe employs 600 staff in the UK and the new office - located on the 7th, 8th, and 13th floors of White Collar Factory on Old Street's "Silicon Roundabout" - will be used as the company's main London hub.

It contains mirrors and lighting that are designed to mimic Adobe Photoshop filters, as well as a library, games area, and showers.

Garrett Ilg, president of Adobe Europe, Middle East and Africa, said: "The office boasts cutting-edge connectivity and technology alongside bright and open areas where teams can meet and work together, as well as quieter spaces for individual work. The White Collar Factory and all of East London provides plenty of downtime and networking opportunities for Adobe employees; we are excited to be a part of such a vibrant and thriving UK community."
