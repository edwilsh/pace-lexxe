  <title>Yunupingu's needless death a wake-up call</title>
  <content>
The loss of Australia's most prominent indigenous musician Dr G Yunupingu to kidney disease has shone a light on the "largely preventable" renal health nightmare afflicting remote communities, his doctor says.
The 46-year-old blind Yolngu singer died last month in Darwin while undergoing dialysis treatment, as there was no services available in his home community of Galiwink'u on Elcho Island.
His specialist, Dr Paul Lawton told the Garma Festival in northeast Arnhem Land that many indigenous Australians have to travel hundreds of kilometres from their remote communities for end-stage renal therapy, which he describes as a "nightmare" akin to purgatory.
