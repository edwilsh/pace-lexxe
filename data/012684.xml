Former Ipswich Mayor, Paul Pisasale is set to face court on charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice.
The 65-year-old is currently on bail on three separate charges, including extortion and assault.
Mr Pisasale resigned as mayor in June amid a Crime and Corruption Commission investigation into an incident in which he was found at Melbourne airport carrying $50,000 cash.
