Billboard advertising giant APN Outdoor's chief executive Richard Herring will step down from the role at the end of September.
The company says Mr Herring, who has been CEO since 2004, has decided to retire from his post and the search for a replacement has begun.
"With a strong management team in place and a bright future ahead for the company, I feel that the time is right for me to step down," Mr Herring said in a statement to the ASX.
