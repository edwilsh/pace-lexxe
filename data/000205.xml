  <title>Vic church leaders oppose dying laws</title>
  <content>
Some of Victoria's most high profile church leaders have signed a joint letter opposing the state's plans to introduce assisted dying legislation.
Catholic Archbishop Denis Hart and Anglican Archbishop Philip Freier are among a group of Victorian religious leaders who signed a joint letter published on Monday, rejecting the push for assisted dying legislation.
A cross-party committee of MPs recommended Victoria come up with a bill to legalise assisted dying, and the government plans to introduce it for debate before the end of the year.
