Mr Stewart was due to brief the Queensland cabinet on security, including airports, on Monday.
Before the doors were closed to media, Mr Stewart said media reports had included a potential attack on the Australian aviation industry.
"There is still the thought that other targets may have been identified by these people and certainly that is the focus of all of the investigation that's currently happening," he said.
"I can assure you that there is still no known threat to Queensland, to anyone in Queensland, or any asset in Queensland and the national alert levels, threat levels, are still at probable, so there has been no change to that."

Mr Stewart is due to update media following the cabinet meeting.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said there were very strong security measures in place ahead of the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games.

"It is very concerning to hear [about the raids in Sydney]," she said.
"The good news is that the intelligence agencies were able to intercept these people but it's very important that as a cabinet we're updated about all the security measures."
Police Minister Mark Ryan said authorities were always vigilant about terrorism activity.
"We're working very closely with our agency partners around the nation," he said.
"The threat level remains at probable but we always are remaining ever vigilant and the Queensland police are continuing to monitor, of course, all the intelligence that's provided to us, not only that we collect ourselves but our agency partners collect as well."
Mr Ryan said Mr Stewart assured him the Queensland police had the resources to deal with terrorism.
The Queensland cabinet is governing from the Gold Coast this week.
