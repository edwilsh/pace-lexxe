  <title>Results season: Tabcorp tumbles to loss, Crown profit propped up by Macau retreat</title>
  <content>
Australia's big gambling businesses Tabcorp and Crown Resorts have posted poor full-year results, but the disappointing efforts are not due to the punters suddenly getting lucky.

Key points:

Tabcorp tumbles to a $20m loss after a $170m profit the year before
A crackdown on promoting gambling in China has seen Crown's VIP revenues halved
Crown made $1.75bn exiting Macau this year which contributed to a doubling in profit

Tabcorp swung to a $20.8 million loss from a $170 million profit in 2016, hit by a series of hefty bills from legal actions, write-downs from its UK joint venture and costs associated with its Tatts takeover.
Crown Resorts' net profit almost doubled to $1.9 billion, but that was entirely due to its retreat from Macau.
Without the sale of its stake in the troubled Melco Resorts joint venture, underlying profit would have fallen 16 per cent to $343 million, well below analysts' consensus forecast.
Tabcorp's bottom line was wiped out by about $200 million worth of "significant" items, including:

$62 million from the AUSTRAC prosecution for
$54 million in costs from the Tatts merger
$48 million loss and $20 million write-down on the Sun Bet joint venture with Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation in the UK
$9 million to relocate the Melbourne HQ
$1.9 million in costs so far for an investigation inwhich cost then chief executive Elmer Funke Kupper his job last year.
Tabcorp's revenues were relatively flat, up 2 per cent to $2.2 billion, while the underlying earnings - with the significant items removed - were down 4 per cent to $179 million.
The market took the result in its stride as the figures were well telegraphed when .
Tabcorp provided an update on its merger plans, saying the scheme of arrangement booklet would be available to shareholders next month, ahead of an expected vote in October.
Crown VIP business hit by China crackdown

The Crown result was weighed down by an almost 50 per cent slump in the VIP trade in Australian casinos.
Crown chief executive John Alexander said the result reflected difficult trading conditions.
"Total normalised revenue across Crown's Australian resorts declined by 12.7 per cent," Mr Alexander said.
"This was primarily due to the reduction in VIP play revenue. Main-floor gaming revenue decreased by 1.4 per cent, with Melbourne flat and softness in Perth."
While abandoning the Melco joint venture in Macau generated net proceeds of $1.75 billion last year and $3.1 billion over the course of the deal, it came with considerable reputational cost.
Chinese authorities last year arrested 19 Crown employees and associates .
A Melbourne-based senior executive is expected to be released in coming weeks after serving a 10-month sentence, while Crown paid a $1.7 million fine on behalf of the employees.
The abrupt end to Crown's lobbying of potential clients in China was a significant factor in falling VIP revenues.
Crown also announced it would buy back another $370 million worth of its shares.
Citi's gaming analyst, Rohan Sundram, described the result as "mixed", with gains on cost cutting and digital betting making up for softer VIP earnings.
At midday [AEST] Tabcorp's shares were up 1.2 per cent to $4.34, while Crown rose 0.9 per cent to $12.89.
