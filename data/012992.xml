  <title>The Early Oil: Flemington</title>
  <content>
YOGI should benefit the step up to 2500m and vast Flemington surrounds to build a case as an enticing prospect, according to Herald Sun form analyst Michael Manley.
Michael also suggests punters have a little wager on Show A Star in the eighth race.

BEST BET

YOGI (Race 6, No. 7)
Gave away too big a start last start at Sandown Lakeside with big weight but still ran on strongly for third over 2100m. Stays in same grade but step to 2500m and Flemington should prove ideal for this exciting staying prospect.

Race 1: VRC Members Pavilion Handicap (1000m) 11.40am

Weight scale makes it an interesting affair with the well performed horses having to carry big weights. Lightly weighted SUNQUEST (8) showed talent in three runs as a two-year-old. Trialled well recently when not far behind WAIT FOR NO ONE (2) at Flemington. After 1.5 kilos claim for Ben Thompson there will be seven kilos difference between that pair. The superbly bred FRANKEL MY DEAR (7) finished strongly in recent Cranbourne jump-out. He'll want further but with 51 kilos should run well. Wait For No One, AZAZEL (1), CAO CAO (3) and INDIAN THUNDER (5) resumes and were above average two-year-olds.
SUGGESTED BET: SUNQUEST EACH-WAY
Race 2: New Season Handicap (1700m) 12.10pm

Huge run from WHYOUASK (7) when fifth at Flemington last start as she was trapped wide throughout but kept on finishing strongly. Last spring she was competitive in Group races including the Edward Manifold Stakes over this distance. ANOTHER BULLSEYE (6) finished fourth in that race and she won well when second-up at Sandown last start. She will carry only 52 kilos after two kilos claim for Taylor Marshall. DULVERTON (2) sat back and produced fast closing sectionals when she won last start at Flemington. She's in great form and is aiming for the hat-trick of wins. HELL OR HIGHWATER (1) led in that race and held on well for third. DOMINO VITALE (3) finished last at her second run back from a spell at Caulfield but she wasn't far away.
SUGGESTED BET: WHYOUASK EACH-WAY
Race 3: Winter Lodge Handicap (1000m) 12.45pm

Flying filly MADEENATY (1) resumes. She ran some tremendous races as a two-year-old including a third in the Magic Millions Classic. She's had three starts this track and distance for a first, second and a third. CHATEAU GRIFFO (2) created a huge impression at her only start when she rocketed home for third to Limestone and Tulip in the Blue Diamond Preview reeling off her last 200m in 11.33 seconds. CROWN WITNESS (3) was well backed and won her debut impressively at Sandown Hillside. Darren Weir's filly PROSECUTION (4) ran on strongly to win at Ballarat last start and she will have a fitness edge over her rivals.
SUGGESTED BET: MADEENATY THE WIN
Race 4: The Nursery Handicap (2000m) 1.20pm

Open race. Enigmatic GALAXY RAIDER (11) is sure to be in the finish. Flashed home last start for second behind the in-form Dulverton on track which played to on pacers. Should be suited by a step up to 2000m and with light-weight gets his chance. KILLARNEY KID (2) has a big weight but always runs well as does this track and distance as does the ageless EXTRA ZERO (3). Query runners are the Lloyd Williams pair of BONDI BEACH (1) and ALOFT (5) who more than have the ability to win this.
SUGGESTED BET: GALAXY RAIDER EACH-WAY
Race 5: The Stayers Lounge Handicap (1200m) 1.55pm

NIKITAS (7) raced on the speed and wore down the luckless Revolving Door over 1400m at Caulfield last start. He's back to 1200m but he's fit and should push forward in a race where the majority of horses are sit sprinters. LORD VON COSTA (6) wasn't far away when he resumed with first-up eighth behind Ability. He likes this track and distance. HAY BALE (9) was strong winning over 1100m against his own age group at Flemington last start. INSPECTOR (2) is under-rated and ran well in the Newmarket this track and distance earlier in the year. PLAY MASTER (3) won well this track and distance last start over KIRANI (8). SMACKDOWN (4) ran on for fourth in the same race.
SUGGESTED BET: NIKITAS EACH-WAY
Race 6: Oliver St Plate (25000m) 2.30pm

Darren Weir's promising staying prospect YOGI (7) should love Flemington and the step up to 2500m. Gave away too much start last time at Sandown Lakeside on a track which played to on-pacers when third to GLOBAL GENTL (4) who led throughout over 2100m. Stablemate CHEQUERED FLAG (8) strolled in with a maiden hurdle at Warrnambool before being a runaway winner on the flat over 2400m at Sandown Hillside over CISMONTANE (11). BULLISH STOCK (2) was disappointing at this track last start after a good third to Charlevoix before that. This is an easier race. KAWABATA (13) didn't fire last start at Sandown Hillside but she gave away a big start with a big weight. She's better than that.
SUGGESTED BET: YOGI THE WIN
Race 7: Jockey Celebration Day Plate (1600m) 3.10pm

Enormous run by the lightly raced REBELLIOUS LORD (13) when third behind the smart Portman over 1400m at Flemington. He was held up for a run half way up the straight and finished strongly. Step up to 1600m will suit. Darren Weir unveiled a smart horse in former German stallion ANDREA MANTEGNA (4) who swept around the field to win his Australian debut at Geelong. JAMINZAH (12) tried hard to run down the front runner and winner Lovani this track and distance last start. WAYANKA (14) ran on strongly for fourth behind Nikitas at Caulfield last start.
SUGGESTED BET: REBELLIOUS LORD THE WIN
Race 8: John and Denise Cobcroft Recognition Handicap (1600m) 3.50pm

Consistent SHOW A STAR (11) looks nicely placed in this. He's back to his pet distance and he's also had one start this track and distance for a comfortable win over Portman in March. COSMIC LIGHTS (13) had a tough run when close-up sixth in the Winter Championship behind Tshahitsi as he was trapped wide throughout. AMOVATIO (2) flew home for close second in that race. RHYTHM TO SPARE (4) also sat wide in that race for close-up fifth. Classy galloper AMRALAH (1) resumes after 22 months off.
SUGGESTED BET: SHOW A STAR EACH-WAY
Race 9: The Rails Handicap (1400m) 4.30pm

Two smart gallopers REVOLVING DOOR (13) and PORTMAN (12) should fight this out. Huge run by Revolving Door last start as he wasn't entitled to finish second behind Nikitas after he was trapped four wide throughout at Caulfield. He's drawn out again but will be ridden by Mark Zahra this time. Portman bolted in when he resumed this track and distance. He's an exciting prospect. ORIENT LINE (10) has hit form and he finished second in that race last start. RICH LUCK (6) resumed with a comfortable win at Geelong which took his record to five wins from seven starts. He's also got potential.
SUGGESTED BET: REVOLVING DOOR THE WIN
Race 10: The Domain Handicap (2000m) 5.05pm

SEATTLE PARK (10) was one of several runners who suffered interference behind WINDBERN (4) in the knock 'em down Derby at Caulfield last start. He was coming home strongly when he almost fell and recovered to be beaten less than two lengths in seventh placing. Windbern should again be hard to beat. EUREKA STREET (9) also ran on out wide for fifth in that race. SHADOW PRINCE (7) led and battled on well for third. SPANISH REEF (3) raced on the speed when comfortable winner here last start. Before that she defeated Lovani.
SUGGESTED BET: SEATTLE PARK EACH-WAY
