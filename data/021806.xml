  <title>Humpback whale sends Whitsundays fishing charter boat flying, injuring tourist</title>
  <content>
Six men are lucky to be alive after a whale threw their boat metres into the air in the Whitsundays.

The group was returning from a reef fishing trip on Saturday afternoon, when the large humpback breached underneath the 8.5 metre aluminium vessel, near Glouster Island.
The impact of the collision with the whale and the water was so great that those on board were violently thrown around the boat, with two men knocked unconscious.

One man, an international tourist, remains in the Proserpine Hospital with severe facial injuries, while the three other men who were injured have all been released.
The boat's co-owner, Rachel Carpenter, says railings on board the boat were bent out of shape as the men were thrown around the boat.
She says it is a miracle that no-one died.

"There could have been so many worse scenarios; they're so lucky they landed upright in the water and the boat wasn't capsized and nobody was thrown out of the boat," she said.
"They thought they had hit a shipping container, or debris from the cyclone (Cyclone Debbie)."
They did not think it was a whale, she said.
The Whitsundays is considered a whale nursery, with the species choosing the warm waters off the Queensland coast to birth their calves.
