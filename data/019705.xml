  <title>Melbourne suburb to get $50m promenade</title>
  <content>
A bayside suburb in Melbourne is set to get a $50 million beach promenade and parkland, the Victorian premier announced.
The removal of level crossings will allow for a road to be extended to Carrum Beach for the promenade and parkland but five properties will also need to be purchased, Premier Daniel Andrews said.
"This is the sort of amenity that everybody wants, that's just a natural extension and we've got the opportunity to do this because we're removing these congested and dangerous level crossings," Mr Andrews said.
