  <title>iSignthis Ltd (ASX:ISX) Investor Presentation - June 2017 4C Quarterly Commentary</title>
  <content>
Melbourne, July 31, 2017 AEST (ABN Newswire) - iSignthis Ltd (ASX:ISX) provides the Company's Investor Presentation of June 2017 4C Quarterly Commentary.
4C June 2017 Quarterly Commentary
- Cash Receipts Up 190% quarter on quarter ($0.155m)
- Unaudited operating revenues of $0.295m for the quarter ended 30 June 2017
- Transaction growth continuing (see the link below)
- Full range of transactional banking services nearing completion
- KYC service operational for EU's June 26th, 2017 4th AML Directive
- Cash at bank $3.85m (including longer term security deposits)
- Net Operating Cashflow in line with expectations ($1.5m)
Transactional processing (including the key element of KYC) is showing steady growth on a month on month basis. This is expected to continue to build as we deploy the services to a wider range of contracted customers, contract new customers and open fully the service to the global operations of the existing integrated merchants.
As mentioned in previous communications to the market, the business operates on a transactional basis with the various transactions (identity verification/KYC, payment processing & monitoring, and funds clearance and settlement) being billed at varying rates depending on volume, size and complexity.
Transaction growth therefore has a direct correlation with revenue on a per merchant basis, but not on a consolidated basis.
Transaction volume also demonstrates testing, integration and 'soak in' phase, that may be unbilled.
What we have achieved?
The building blocks have been established and transaction volumes are growing.
- Patented Paydentity(TM) process, providing barriers to entry
- Listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX)
- Built and delivered Paydentity(TM) from a concept to a working model, including back end connectivity to numerous banks and financial institutions.
- Paydentity(TM) certified PCI DSS Level 1 in the cloud.
- National Australia Bank (ASX:NAB) Payment Facilitation agreement
- Contracted multiple AML sector businesses across various sectors and jurisdictions, proving Paydentity(TM) business and compliance case.
- EEA Authorised Monetary Financial Institution (MFI)
- ISO27001 Certified and EC GDPR ready
- Recurring Paydentity(TM) transactions commenced on commercial scale
- Transactional revenues growing steadily as more customers go live
