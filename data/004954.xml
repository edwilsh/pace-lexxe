  <title>Midnight Oil documentary in the works</title>
  <content>
Australian rockers Midnight Oil will be the subject of a new documentary charting the band's career from 1975 to today.
The Oils recently re-formed following their split in 2002 and have been on a world tour that will finish in Sydney in November.
The documentary, Backburning, will look at the changing nation through the eyes of Midnight Oil, one of the country's most political bands.
The film made by Beyond Entertainment, Blink TV and Village Roadshow will tell the band's story and chart the group's influence.
The documentary is one of 15 new projects being funded by a $4.15 million investment from Screen Australia through its Documentary Producer and Commissioned programs.
Another doco being funded is Sam Neill's Foxtel series Uncharted, in which the actor retraces Captain James Cook's travels to mark the 250th anniversary of his first voyage to Australia.
