  <title>Turn back time: Your club's big three regrets</title>
  <content>
Josh Jenkins coming back too soon from fractured rib
The Crows' key forward was hospitalised after fracturing his rib and suffering cartilage damage against Hawthorn in round two. He missed only three games, but didn't have an impact in rounds six to eight before getting dropped to the SANFL. Jenkins later admitted he needed more time to recover and was still in pain when he returned to the side.

Dismal first quarter against the Roos
After six straight wins to start the season, the Crows were brought back to Earth after conceding 10 unanswered goals in the first quarter against North Melbourne in round seven. The Kangaroos made the most of a strong breeze, but the Crows were never able to get into the game. It was the first game where Rory Sloane was tagged and showed he could be nullified.

Keeping Scott Thompson for another year and letting Jarryd Lyons go
He's been an absolute warrior for the Crows, but Scott Thompson has made just the one appearance at senior level this year. The Crows signed the 34-year-old to a one-year extension at the end of last season. Thompson had just 10 disposals against the Western Bulldogs in round 16 and announced he would retire at the end of 2017. Meanwhile, the Crows let Jarryd Lyons leave at the end of last year, and he's been a solid contributor for Gold Coast. - Lee Gaskin 

Blowing a 2-0 start
Everything started beautifully for Chris Fagan as the Lions upset Queensland rivals Gold Coast in the opening round. When Eric Hipwood kicked the first goal of the final quarter against Essendon the following week, the Lions had the lead and were dreaming of a 2-0 start. But alas, they ran out of legs in the final 10 minutes and were overrun. What they'd do for an extra win now. 

Not recruiting a small forward
The Lions still need skilled midfielders - which they successfully hunted in last year's draft - but the lack of a clever, pressuring small forward has hurt them at times. Jake Barrett has done well in the foreign position, but with Dayne Zorko and Lewy Taylor playing further upfield, the lack of pace in the forward 50 hurts when trying to get to the feet of the young bigs and then holding the ball in there. 

The end of quarters - and matches
It's no surprise the youngest team in the competition gets worse as matches wear on. The Lions' performance in 'red time' has been horrific (think of the 40-point loss to Port Adelaide in round 13 where the Power kicked eight goals to one during that period). They have won just five third quarters and four final quarters - the least numbers of quarters won after half-time of any team. Physical development will help, but it's an area that has cost deeply in 2017. - Michael Whiting

Letting opportunities slip
While the Blues have managed to win five games, they could have doubled that tally if they had been able to finish other matches strongly. In five other games, including Melbourne (twice), St Kilda, North Melbourne and Adelaide, they have been in winning positions late in the contest only to squander the opportunities. More experience and midfield depth would have helped.

Not giving Jacob Weitering a breather
The No.1 pick in the 2015 NAB AFL Draft has endured a tough season and appears in need of a rest. Missed only two games in his debut season last year and played every match this season - maybe leaving him out for a game or two mid-season might have freshened him up for this stage of the campaign.

Failing to lock up Levi sooner
Levi Casboult has the strongest pair of hands in the AFL and has improved his conversion in front of goal this season (28.16). He also has acted as a relieving ruckman for the hard-working Matthew Kreuzer. At 27 and a free agent at the end of this season surely he deserves another contract, and the Blues could have quashed speculation about his future and signed him by now to ward off potential suitors with a big chequebook, including Richmond. - Howard Kotton

Not ensuring Wells was in better shape
Former Kangaroos star Daniel Wells signed a lucrative three-year deal with the Magpies but arrived for pre-season training out of condition, which contributed to the calf issues that have restricted him to just nine games so far this season. It's hard to say Wells' absence hasn't hurt the Pies considering they have six wins, a draw and two losses with him, but are 1-8 without him. Youngster Jordan De Goey's late start to the season - courtesy of a broken hand and a club-imposed suspension for lying about it - also hurt. 

Booking the Mayne non-event
Perhaps never before has a decision to sign a recruit to a big four-year contract been condemned so quickly as that of the deal to grab ex-Docker Chris Mayne. The one-time deadeye Freo forward had little impact in the opening three rounds and was dropped, and has hardly been in the selection frame since. Mayne needs to either rediscover something resembling his best or reinvent himself entirely. In any case, the Pies have the 28-year-old for another three years. 

Surrendering significant leads
On three occasions the Pies have failed to win after leading by at least 26 points. They led the Giants by 26 points at quarter-time at Spotless Stadium in round eight before succumbing in the dying seconds. In round 12 they held a 28-point lead over Melbourne in the second quarter only to go down by four points. And, worst of all, they were belting the Crows by 50 points early in the third quarter and were lucky to escape with a draw. - Ben Collins

Brendon Goddard's fateful kick out against the Swans
The experienced Bomber and 300-gamer is probably the first player at Essendon you'd choose to have the ball in the dying moments of a close game. But it wasn't to be against the Swans in round 14 at the SCG. With seconds remaining, Goddard played on from the goal square but his attempt to clear the ball was smothered. It allowed the Swans to lock the ball inside their forward 50 which led to the after-the-siren goal from Gary Rohan to clinch their victory when they had trailed by 19 points minutes earlier. 

Losing to the Brisbane Lions
Essendon's round 15 loss to the bottom-placed Lions may well come back to haunt the Dons in their bid to return to the finals. The Bombers led by 27 points early in the final quarter in the Etihad Stadium clash, but got complacent and were overrun. The defeat highlighted Essendon's inconsistency and, in a season as tight as 2017, could be very costly in their bid for a top-eight spot.

Not signing David Zaharakis earlier in the year
Essendon will have to pay full price for Zaharakis now given his brilliant patch of form. The midfielder started the season in sluggish touch and struggled to find his rhythm, but the restricted free agent has been at his best over the past three months, gathering 30 or more disposals in six of his past 11 games. Zaharakis remains unsigned for next year and his value continues to rise. He might have cost the Bombers less earlier in the year. - Callum Twomey

Not playing the kids from the start
Fremantle's team selections in the opening two rounds were mystifying. Despite embarking on a rebuild, the Dockers stuck by veteran campaigners and the same 22 was walloped by Geelong and Port Adelaide, putting immense pressure on coach Ross Lyon to change his gamestyle amid doubts over his ability to move with the times. Paul Hasleby called it Freo's darkest hour, but Lyon wielded the axe - cutting six players including long-time favourites Zac Dawson and Danyle Pearce - and turned to youth. The Dockers recovered to win six of their next seven games and found some promising youngsters.

Bringing Sandi back against the Saints
Giant ruckman Aaron Sandilands missed four games battling a hamstring issue and then lasted less than a quarter before pinging his 'string in his comeback match in round 15, forcing him out for the season. The silver lining was Sean Darcy stepping up to lead the ruck, but having his 34-year-old mentor around and working out if the pair could play together next year would have been a bonus in the last two months of the season.

Spraying shots at goal in the Derby disaster
The final Western Derby at Domain Stadium was forgettable to say the least, with Freo wasting umpteen chances and botching a golden opportunity to claim local bragging rights in front of a 'home' crowd. Bradley Hill, one of the AFL's elite kicks, had a shocking day missing several gilt-edged chances in front of goal but he wasn't alone as Freo kicked 5.14 and made some horrendous errors going inside 50 in a frustrating five-goal loss. - Travis King 

Showing a lack of caution with Cockatoo
When the 20-year-old pulled up after a pacy goal against Carlton, it signaled his third right-hamstring injury of the season. He first hurt it in round nine before a repeat in round 13, and then came straight into the senior side for the clash with the Blues. The Cats are adamant his rehab was sufficient, but if they had their time again, they'd surely consider playing him in the VFL first.   

Not challenging Dangerfield's suspension
This one might not be fully realised until the Monday night before the Grand Final when an ineligible Dangerfield could be denied a second Brownlow medal because of his one-week suspension for tackling Matthew Kreuzer. Yes, there were two matches at stake if the ban was unsuccessfully challenged, but a loss to the Sydney Swans on Friday night - with Dangerfield rugged up in the grandstand - could go on to dent the Cats' top-two aspirations. 

Failing to instigate 'Operation Tag Sloane' the second time around
The Cats had great success nullifying the effectiveness of Adelaide's Rory Sloane in round 11, with Scott Selwood keeping him to 23 disposals. In round 18, the Crows' midfielder took advantage of the fact the tight tag wasn't repeated and was best on ground with 28 disposals and three goals in his team's 21-point win. - Jennifer Phelan.

First quarter against the Lions
With a new $22 million training and administration base, good off-season signings and no injuries to speak of, hopes were high for 2017 - but they were largely dashed in one quarter. , kicking the game's first seven goals and holding on for an upset win. The Suns never really recovered.

Everything about playing in China
Right from the moment Rodney Eade complained about the travel - inadvertently giving his players an 'out' to fail - the whole trip to China was a disaster. The Suns had hoped to win over locals from a support and sponsorship point of view and instead . They got some much-needed cash for selling the game, but walked away the big losers.

Jarrod Harbrow's drink driving charge
For a club that has worked so hard to clean up its off-field image, this was a black eye it could have done without. Harbrow's leadership is revered at the Suns and it was a shock to most that he was caught driving with twice the legal limit of alcohol in his blood. In the midst of a fantastic individual season,  was something his under pressure coach could have done without. - Michael Whiting

Letting Toby Greene's emotions get out of control too often
The 2016 club champion had a couple of close calls before he was suspended for two weeks after clocking Bulldog Caleb Daniel in round six, and it hurt his side when they lost to St Kilda the following week. He's currently serving another two-week ban for a jumper punch on Tiger Alex Rance, and if it happens again this year, his biggest regret might be yet to come. 

Toby Greene has been reported for striking.

Blowing two points against the Cats
The Giants came back from a 20-point last term deficit to snatch the lead, but undid all that hard work. With the ball deep inside Geelong's forward 50 Heath Shaw blasted a kick to the boundary and, while he was pinged for deliberate, he gave his team valuable time to set up. Somehow though, they left Phil Davis one out with the powerful Tom Hawkins, who took a strong mark and booted a point after the siren to level the scores. 

Not resting Rory Lobb against Richmond in round nine
The athletic big man pulled up with a sore groin from the previous week's win over Collingwood, but despite struggling through training, he played against the Tigers. Lobb had little effect on the match, which the Giants won in another steal at the death, but didn't play again until round 15, and still hasn't recaptured his early season form. - Adam Curley

Not turning to youth earlier
Mounting injuries and defeats ultimately forced coach Alastair Clarkson to pick his young players, who have largely led the club's resurgence. None of Ryan Burton, Blake Hardwick, James Sicily, Billy Hartung or Tim O'Brien were in the Hawks' round one team, while Irish teenager Conor Glass has proven the latest handy addition. There is a bit to like about Teia Miles, James Cousins and Dallas Willsmore, too. 

The round nine fadeout against Collingwood
Much is being made of Hawthorn's revival in the past six rounds, but it could have started earlier. The 1-5 opening to the season made the Hawks' task tough, but consecutive victories over Melbourne and the Brisbane Lions, then a 43-point second-quarter lead over the Magpies suggested the tide was turning. Collingwood's midfield overwhelmed the brown and gold from there - despite Tom Mitchell's 50-disposal effort - as the Pies booted 11 of the contest's last 13 goals to win by 18. 

Smith's decision to play on against the Cats
This is harsh, and everything is easier with hindsight, but Isaac Smith had the chance to cap a furious Hawk fightback against Geelong in round 17, when he marked inside 50 with seconds left on the clock. Smith's infamous, after-the-siren set-shot miss from gettable range against the Cats in last year's qualifying final may have influenced his decision to play on this time. As we all know, he missed again and Geelong won by three points. That moment will be remembered as costly if Hawthorn narrowly fails to make the finals. - Marc McGowan

The lack of on-field discipline
The Demons have denied they have a discipline problem but it is hard to argue with the numbers. Melbourne has lost 14 games to suspension in 2017, the most of any team in the AFL. Jordan Lewis (three matches), Jesse Hogan (two), Tom Bugg (six) and Bernie Vince (three) have all fallen foul of the Match Review Panel. Losing such experienced players to suspension has been tough to overcome.

Tomas Bugg has been reported for this strike on Callum Mills.

Hogan's incredible run of misfortune
The star forward has managed just eight matches this season after a series of unfortunate events and setbacks. Hogan has had to grieve the passing of his father, Tony, to cancer. If that was not enough, the 22-year-old was then diagnosed with testicular cancer in May. Now, the spearhead will be out until at least the start of finals after breaking his collarbone against North Melbourne at the weekend. A fit Hogan would have made a big difference to Melbourne's team.

Losing tight games from winning positions
Melbourne's close losses to Fremantle, Hawthorn and North Melbourne on the weekend, and to a lesser extent Richmond and the other loss to the Kangaroos, could be damaging to the club's ultimate finals chances. With four games remaining in the year, the Demons are seventh on the ladder and tied on points with West Coast and the Western Bulldogs. The Demons have won the third-most quarters of any side in the AFL, but could be much better placed if not for those drop offs. - Ben Guthrie

The string of close defeats
The Roos' season could be so different if not for five defeats by five points or fewer, including three after leading by 29 points or more. It started when Braydon Preuss' over-eager tackle on Geelong's George Horlin-Smith with 90 seconds on the clock in round two . Two rounds later,  and the trend was set. Lindsay Thomas, in his 200th game, could have saved face with a late ping from 50m, but his shot sailed to the left.

Not refreshing the key backs sooner
North made a statement when it jettisoned Brent Harvey, Nick Dal Santo, Drew Petrie and Michael Firrito last year, in what Brad Scott dubbed an "aggressive reset". That was followed by four debutants - Jy Simpkin, Braydon Preuss, Declan Mountford and Mitch Hibberd - in round one this season, but others had to bide their time. Veteran Lachie Hansen was preferred to developing key defenders Sam Durdin and Dan Nielson, both drafted in 2014, for much of the year, but they finally leapfrogged Hansen into the senior side and Nielson, in particular, is thriving. 

Picking young talls too soon after injuries
Nick Larkey and Braydon Preuss consistently impressed for Werribee in 2017. Preuss played four early AFL games before getting stuck in the VFL, then an untimely back injury arose just as the Roos grew impatient with Todd Goldstein's form. Larkey was equal fifth in the VFL's goalkicking, only for a knee injury to sideline him. But their recent AFL opportunities came after multi-week injury absences. Larkey sustained another knee injury in his senior debut and missed the following week, while Preuss still appeared hampered by his back last Saturday. - Marc McGowan 

Goalkicking going haywire against top-eight rivals
With finals spots at a premium, the Power will look back on their losses to West Coast and Richmond as opportunities missed to get an edge on fellow top-eight sides. The Power had 27 scoring shots to 22, but lost to the Eagles by 10 points (12.15 to 15.7), while it was a similar story against the Tigers (8.15 to 11.10).

Mature-aged recruit's failure to take the next step
It was a magnificent feelgood story - 27-year-old rookie-listed key forward Brett Eddy making his AFL against Sydney in round one. But after just three goals in as many games, Eddy was dropped from the Power side and hasn't been seen since. The Power still need another tall option in attack to partner spearhead Charlie Dixon.

Not keeping Dangerfield under wraps at the Cattery
The Power looked destined to take a massive scalp when they were leading Geelong at Simonds Stadium with time winding down. But with a stoppage deep in the Cats' forward 50, Sam Gray failed to stay with Brownlow medallist Patrick Dangerfield and he kicked the match-winning goal to give the Cats a two-point victory. - Lee Gaskin

Leaving space for Lachie Neale and David Mundy
Brandon Ellis snapped what looked like the match-winner in round eight against Fremantle, giving the Tiqers a four-point lead with 21 seconds to play. That's when things fell down, however, with the centre bounce structure allowing Docker Lachie Neale to stream into space and kick deep inside 50. There was also space for David Mundy to work into, marking and kicking the goal after the siren. It was the second of three consecutive losses by less than a goal, each of which contained its own last-minute regrets.         

What just happened! 😱 David Mundy, take a bow.

Letting Schache slip
The Tigers' lack of tall forwards has been laid bare this season, but they have made a small forward line work. Whether that is a long-term structure is questionable and Brisbane Lions youngster Josh Schache was clearly in their sights for 2018 and beyond. He re-signed with the Lions in June and the Tigers missed their chance. They now face a battle to find a support act for Jack Riewoldt with the same upside. They could find a diamond in the NAB AFL Draft, but they will need to be patient if they take that path.     

Pushing for the best of Prestia early on
The Tigers couldn't get a full pre-season out of midfield recruit Dion Prestia and his training has been compromised since. The club maintained it would see the best of Prestia late in the season, but just as he was delivering in a run-with role he required a rest with knee and calf soreness. There is still time for the important midfielder to reach his best this year, but would the Tigers have had better results if he had worked slowly into the year and missed some early football? Only they would know. - Nathan Schmook

Failing to give Nick Riewoldt a break earlier in the season
For much of the season, the Saints champion either looked very good or restricted by his dodgy knees. After hyperextending his right knee in round one he took a week off, but both knees proved an issue at times during the season. It was visibly problematic in the win against Greater Western Sydney in round seven, and coach Alan Richardson conceded Riewoldt could have been managed for that game. 

The final 60 seconds against Port Adelaide
St Kilda led by 10 points with a minute left as the ball entered Port's forward line. It was a four-on-two contest in the Saints' favour but Aaron Young was able to close the margin to four points. At the final throw-in, Seb Ross didn't check Robbie Gray tightly enough and Blake Acres was sucked into the stoppage, opening up space for Gray to slot the match-winning goal. 

What an incredible finish!

Jake Carlisle not keeping his mouth shut
When St Kilda and Carlton met in round eight, controversy surrounded Carlisle's highly personal comment to Marc Murphy that crossed a line and hurt the Blues skipper's wife and family. The Saints might have come away with a 19-point victory but the incident wasn't a good look for the club or player. - Dinny Navaratnam

Trading Toby Nankervis to Richmond in the off-season
The aggressive big man never got an extended run in the senior side at Sydney, but showed when he filled in for the injured Kurt Tippett late last season that he had enormous potential. He was offered a contract for 2017 but knowing opportunities would be scarce behind Tippett, Sam Naismith and Callum Sinclair, he headed for the Tigers. Nankervis has played 17 games as the No.1 man, while the Swans' ruckmen have all battled form and fitness problems. 

Dane Rampe's mistimed leap
When they started the season with the likes of Jarrad McVeigh, Isaac Heeney, Gary Rohan and Tom Papley all injured, the loss of the Swans' best defender in the lead-up to round two was shattering. Rampe broke his arm when he tried to jump a chain fence outside the SCG while doing some recovery running, and missed seven games, five of which his team lost. 

The Round 10 brain fade against the Hawks
The Swans had turned their season around with three straight wins, but blew a chance for a fourth against Hawthorn. Scores were level late in the final term when Jarryd Roughead took a grab on the 50-metre arc, but when Dan Hannebery came in to stand the mark he gave the Hawks skipper two extra steps, and he blasted a bomb from the spot Hannebery should have been standing, to kick his team to victory. - Adam Curley

Jarryd Roughead stepped up for the ultimate captain's goal.

Yeo's costly poster
The blame for losing to Collingwood in round 18 isn't on Elliot Yeo, but if his running 25m shot in the dying stages hadn't shaved the post West Coast might have avoided a final-quarter meltdown. The fallout from that defeat saw calls for coach Adam Simpson's head and stern appraisals of some veteran players' futures. Had the Eagles won and stayed firmly in the top-four race, would we have seen Matt Priddis' shock retirement last week? 

The inexplicable kick-in
Trailing by three points with only 46 seconds left against Gold Coast in round 11, skipper Shannon Hurn took possession after a Suns behind and seemed certain to unleash a booming kick-in down the guts. Instead he chipped to Sam Mitchell, who in turn went short and wide to Lewis Jetta. If it was a set play it went horribly wrong. By the time Jetta bombed to the wing 17 seconds had been wasted and then Tom Lynch gobbled an uncontested mark to ice the game. 

Stopping the Kennedy sniper
Since dual Coleman medallist Josh Kennedy went down like he had been shot in the final term against GWS the Eagles' season has been on a knife's edge. West Coast lost to the Giants by just eight points, and then battled without their star goalkicker for five games as he overcame a calf/Achilles issue. The Eagles went 2-3 during that period, but almost certainly would've turned three-point losses to the Suns and Demons into victories if Kennedy was playing. - Travis King 

An inability to split the big sticks
The Dogs are the worst in the League in front of the big sticks, with an accuracy of just 43.4 per cent. Their inability to convert ample opportunities has been costly, with their 9.19 in the round nine clash with Greater Western Sydney especially costly in a two-point loss. Sitting just out of the eight in a very tight competition, the premiers' wayward ways are also reflected in their poor percentage of 100.3. 

Being too sentimental with veteran Boyd
With Matthew Boyd playing just nine senior games so far this season due to fitness and form, it appears the 34-year-old went on one season too many. The 2016 All Australian said recently he doesn't regret playing on, but it would be sad to see the club great and former captain finish his highly respected career in the VFL. 

Letting a key defender slip through their fingers
With the club's experienced key defensive stocks plagued by injuries and poor form this season, did the Dogs do enough to beef up the vitally important department after Essendon's Michael Hurley rebuffed their advances last year? Joel Hamling defected to Fremantle, Marcus Adams succumbed to another serious foot injury and Fletcher Roberts has been dropped several times to the VFL. While youngsters Zaine Cordy and Lewis Young are extremely promising, Bomber Joe Daniher's six goals on the weekend shows it's an area in which the Dogs can be exploited. - Ryan Davidson
