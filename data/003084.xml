A MAN accused of violently raping a woman to death on an isolated beach told a detective, "these things just happen, man, that's it. Boys will be boys and girls will be girls", a court has heard.

Adrian Attwater, 42, has pleaded not guilty to the rape and manslaughter of mother-of-seven Lynette Daley, 33, who bled to death following Australia Day celebrations on Ten Mile Beach in northern NSW on January 27, 2011, the  reports.

His co-accused Paul Maris, 47, has pleaded not guilty to aggravated sexual assault in company and hindering the discovery of evidence by burning a bloodied foam mattress.

Crown prosecutor Philip Strickland said Ms Daley was in a relationship with Attwater when she agreed to go camping with him and his friend Maris on Australia Day
