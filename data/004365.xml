  <title>One Nation dumps another candidate</title>
  <content>
ANOTHER One Nation candidate has been dumped by the party in mysterious circumstances.
John Cox, who survived as Redcliffe candidate in January when inflammatory comments he made on social media questioning 9/11 were made public, has now been disendorsed.
State Leader Steve Dickson confirmed the decision had been made in the past week.
"It's a decision that we came to in the party that he's not a candidate," Mr Dickson said.
But he would not reveal the reason behind the decision.
"I'm not going into details," he said. "We're moving on. We're looking for another candidate in Redcliffe."
Mr Cox was discovered earlier this year to have shared conspiracy theory videos questioning the September 11 terrorist attacks against the US. But the party stood by him at the time.
He's the latest in a string of One Nation candidate to drop out ahead of the upcoming Queensland poll.
Former Bundamba candidate Shan Ju Lin was disendorsed after posting anti-gay comments and Peter Rogers was dumped from running in the far north seat of Mulgrave over claims posted on his blog that the Port Arthur massacre was faked.
Damien Emery dropped out in Pumicestone for business reasons.
The party's former Currumbin candidate, Andy Semple, was the first to leave One Nation when he quit in December.
He had been asked to remove a tweet joking about the LGBTI community and refused to do so.
The Courier-Mail has attempted to contact Mr Cox.
