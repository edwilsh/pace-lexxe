  <title>Cookie crumbles: Woolworths drops Kooka's products</title>
  <content>
Woolworths have dealt a blow to a regional Victorian manufacturer whose products the supermarket has decided to take off shelves. 
Donald company Kooka's Country Cookies took to Facebook last night to announce the supermarket giant would pull their biscuits from supermarkets in all states except Victoria and Tasmania. 
"The Kooka's team is proud of their products and it is with disappointment that we find we cannot supply to Woolworths customers throughout Australia," a spokesperson wrote on the company's Facebook page last night.  
The retailer's move angered Kooka's followers, who bemoaned the lack of support for Australian-made products. 

The company, which started in 1994 with just five staff members, has grown to employs 28 people in Donald, a town with a population of just 1700. 
The biscuits can still be purchased from Coles, Officeworks and the independent supermarkets across the country.

Kooka's and Woolworths were both contacted for comment.
