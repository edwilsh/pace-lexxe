EXPRESSIONS of interest to be involved in helping create Townsville's most futuristic house are about to close as the project nears construction.
The Innovation Home Project will be built by Finlay Homes and will form part of North Shore's newest display village to showcase innovation and sustainable living.
The project is in the design phase and expressions of interest to be a supplier will close by the end of the month.
Stockland North Shore project director Andrew Astorquia said more than 30 local and national suppliers had already signed up to be part of the project.

Finlay Homes' innovation house.

"This is a really exciting project as it incorporates cutting-edge design and technology products that are available now," he said.
"We are working with everyone from James Cook University researchers who are using plastic cuts from old nappies to create sustainable concrete, manufacturers of airconditioning systems that completely eliminate mould to electric vehicle charging, and more.
"But what is more important is that much of the product and building materials that we incorporate are affordable for people to adapt to their own homes - and it helps them understand how to future proof their biggest investments."
Darren Finlay from Finlay Homes created the Innovation House concept and said the project could be the first of its kind.
"This Innovation Home Project is increasing its scope to touch on all of facets of sustainability including, design, water, energy, products, healthy house and technology," he said.
"This could only be done with the support of the developer Stockland and is probably the first of its kind to this degree."
Project co-ordinator Rowan Blizzard said thousands of hours of research into best-practice design had been invested by product suppliers to help create what will be the future of home building in the tropics.
"Bunnings, Reece and many more local suppliers have put their hands up to be part of this exciting project," Mr Blizzard said.
"Over 10,000 people are expected to visit the house once constructed so it is a fantastic opportunity to showcase the best and most innovative products on the market.
"We encourage anyone who is developing sustainable and innovative products to contact us to be part of this project."
Suppliers interested in being part of the Innovation Home Project can call Rowan Blizzard on 0412 997 754 or email rowan@innovationhouse.com.au.
