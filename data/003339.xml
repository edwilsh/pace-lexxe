  <title>Peak hour crash: Bruce Hwy traffic grinds to halt</title>
  <content>
BREAKING: Traffic is already mounting on the Bruce Hwy after a crash during peak hour.

Just minutes after the collision north of the Caloundra Rd interchange, traffic had already banked in the southbound lanes almost 2km, back past Aussie World.

Commuters have reported the banked traffic is barely moving. 

Emergency crews are arriving on scene. 

More to come.

This is how early you need to be at the airport now.
