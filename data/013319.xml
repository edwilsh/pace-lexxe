  <title>'Game of Thrones' star Sophie Turner says she beat out a 'far better actress' for a job because she has millions of social media followers</title>
  <content>
Celebrity often outweighs talent when it comes to landing roles in Hollywood, and the recent audition experience of "Game of Thrones" star Sophie Turner is another example - according to her.

Turner, who plays Sansa Stark on the hit HBO show, told  that she won a role over a "far better" actress for a project because she has a "big social-media following."

Turner's online audience includes 5.4 million followers on , 1.35 million on , and 2 million on .

"A lot of what I have achieved is about timing and luck, but it is also, and I hate to say it, about a big social-media following," Turner told the .

"I auditioned for a project and it was between me and another girl who is a far better actress than I am, far better, but I had the followers, so I got the job," she said. "It's not right, but it is part of the movie industry now."

Though Turner didn't name the project in question, she is  in four films over the next two years. These upcoming projects include "Berlin, I Love You," "Hunstville," "Time Freak," and a reprisal of her role as Jean Grey in "X-Men: Dark Phoenix."

We must note, however, that while Turner is speaking to a truth in Hollywood, she's also being modest. She has given a spectacular performance as Sansa Stark in "Game of Thrones," especially in the later seasons.
