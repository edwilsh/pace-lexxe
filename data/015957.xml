A teenager is facing aggravated assault charges over an attack on a 71-year-old Perth postal worker who was knocked off her motorbike and repeatedly kicked as she lay on the ground.
Police say she was delivering mail on Templeman Place in Midland about 1.30pm on Thursday when the 19-year-old man allegedly attacked.
The woman suffered minor injuries and was discharged from St John of God Midland Hospital later that day.
CCTV images released by police of another man are not of the attacker, but of a someone who helped the investigation.
