  <title>Gambler killed friend over $100</title>
  <content>
A GAMBLING addict murdered one of his best friends after being refused $100, then cut up his body and disposed of his remains in Perth, to solve his financial problems, a court has heard.
David Napier, 54, killed 70-year-old Richard Andrews at the victim's Calista home by bludgeoning him with a hammer then dismembered his body in August last year.
The Supreme Court of WA heard Napier was shown "nothing but kindness" by Mr Andrews whose bank accounts he plundered after the murder.
