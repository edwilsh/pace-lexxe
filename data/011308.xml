  <title>Coast faces hot end to week</title>
  <content>
DAYTIME temperatures on the coast are expected to hit 26 degrees on Friday as northerly winds push a hot air mass into the region ahead of a trough forming over western Queensland.
Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Julian De Marco said Saturday would be only slightly cooler with the maximum hitting 25 degrees against an August of 22 degrees.
There is a slight chance of rain over Saturday, Sunday and Monday but any falls are likely to be recorded well north of the Sunshine Coast as the region continues a dry spell that stretches back to July 19 when 0.4mm was recorded in the BOM's automatic gauges at Sunshine Coast Airport.
Mr De Marco said the 0.2mm recorded on July, 24, 27 and 31 could more likely be attributed to dew forming in the gauges.
The region's last substantial rainfall was only 2.8mm on July 11.
The temperature today will hit 23 degrees after getting down to 9.8 degrees at 1.30am climbing to only 10.6 degrees by 6am.
It will drop to 13 degrees overnight into Friday before climbing steadily to 26 degrees on a partly cloudy day with a chance of rain. Winds will be northerly at 15-20 kmh overnight switching north north-west before dawn and then fading into the afternoon.
Saturday will have a slight chance of rain on an otherwise sunny day with light winds and a 25 degree maximum with Sunday mostly sunny with light winds and daytime maximums a cooler 23 degrees.
It will be partly cloudy Monday with light winds, a slight chance of rain and a maximum temperature that will climb to 24 degrees.
