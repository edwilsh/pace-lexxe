MRP preview: Big three in suspension danger

Dustin Martin earned another three votes in the Brownlow predictor against the Suns

IF SUPERSTAR Patrick Dangerfield is banned for the tackle that left Carlton ruckman Matthew Kreuzer concussed on Saturday night, Dustin Martin is in line to win the Brownlow Medal by the biggest margin ever.

Dangerfield's hopes of taking home the medal for the second-straight year are in the hands of the Match Review Panel after the Cat pinned Kreuzer's arms and drove him into the Etihad Stadium turf early in the third term of Geelong's 65-point win.

The AFL.com.au Brownlow predictor did not award Dangerfield a vote for his 23-disposal and two-goal game against the Blues.

Meanwhile, Martin was again prolific, notching up 34 disposals and a goal as the Tigers posted a 33-point victory against Gold Coast at Metricon Stadium.

Martin was considered best-on-ground for that performance - the seventh time that has happened in Richmond's past nine matches.

It left the powerful midfielder with a tally of 32 votes. Dangerfield sat second with 24 while Hawthorn ball-winner Tom Mitchell trailed far behind, on 19.

The greatest margin anyone has taken the Brownlow by was Richmond's Roy Wright, when he tallied 29 votes to finish 10 ahead Collingwood's Neil Mann.

That doesn't take into account 1977, when there were two field umpires and both awarded votes, with South Melbourne's Graham Teasdale (59) finishing ahead of Richmond's Kevin Bartlett (45).

In 1924-30, one vote was handed out per match.

With four games left, Martin could break the record regardless of whether Dangerfield is rubbed out.

Brownlow betting was suspended for Dangerfield with CrownBet on Monday morning. Martin was into favouritism at $1.55.
