  <title>JK Rowling sorry for Trump disabled swipe</title>
  <content>
JK Rowling has apologised for accusing US President Donald Trump of ignoring a disabled child.
The Harry Potter author called the US leader "horrible" after a clip appeared to show him refusing to shake the boy's hand in the White House.
But the boy's mother, Marjorie Kelly Weer, corrected Rowling with a post on Facebook.
"If someone can please get a message to JK Rowling: Trump didn't snub my son & Monty wasn't even trying to shake his hand," she wrote.
The writer "apologised unreservedly" in a series of Twitter posts.
"Re: my tweets about the small boy in a wheelchair whose proffered hand the president appeared to ignore in press footage," she wrote.
"Multiple sources have informed me that that was not a full or accurate representation of their interaction.
"I very clearly projected my own sensitivities around the issue of disabled people being overlooked or ignored onto the images I saw and if that caused any distress to that boy or his family, I apologise unreservedly."
Rowling has deleted her original tweets on the subject.
