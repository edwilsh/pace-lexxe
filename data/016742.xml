  <title>Broadway hits to dazzle</title>
  <content>
THE anatomy of a Broadway musical will be on display when KSP Theatre presents Broadway & Beyond II.
As the name might suggest, this isn't the first time KSP has visited the Broadway theme.
"We did Broadway & Beyond in 2013," creative director Gemma Mealin said.
"We decided to revisit it, because not only did the audience love it, but so did the cast."
Ms Mealin said this time the cast of 18 would be tackling Broadway in a new way.
"This time we're showing the audience the anatomy of the musical. It'll be a high-energy show where we take them through the opening number, the character introductions, the love songs, the fight songs, the resolution and the closing numbers," she said.
"There will be numbers from Wicked, Hairspray, We Will Rock You, Cabaret.
"A lot of hard work has gone into this, from the choreography, to the set, to the lighting and Vdesign. It is going to be a very fun show."
The show is on August 4-5, 11-12, and 18-19, at 7.30pm, and August 13, at 2.30pm.
Tickets are $20 for adults and $17.50 for concession, members and groups of 10 or more.
