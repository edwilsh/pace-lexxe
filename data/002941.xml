Sean Spicer already seems eager for Vice President Mike Pence to run for president in 2024, offering to "play any role he asks" if he wins the White House.

On Saturday, Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California jokingly  that Pence "is somewhere planning an inauguration."

She added that Spicer, who recently announced that he's stepping down from his post as White House press secretary, and Reince Priebus, Trump's  chief of staff, would be leading the transition.

"Mike Pence is somewhere planning an inauguration," Waters . "Priebus and Spicer will lead the transition."

Spicer  on Monday, saying that he would "proudly play any role he asks" should Pence decide to run on in 2024.

"When and if  runs in 2024 I would proudly play any role he asks," Spicer tweeted. "Good to know you have already conceded that."

Spicer and Priebus, who previously worked together at the Republican National Committee, didn't last long in Trump's White House. But Pence is more popular with establishment Republicans. He hasn't announced any intention to run for president in 2024.
