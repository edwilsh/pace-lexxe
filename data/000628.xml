  <title>Sydney couple to face terror-plot trial</title>
  <content>
A young Sydney couple has been ordered to stand trial on charges related to plotting a terrorist attack.
Alo-Bridget Namoa had allegedly once described herself and her husband, Sameh Bayda, as an "Islamic Bonnie and Clyde" and wrote him a "goodbye love note" saying she wanted to have his child as a memento.
In the Downing Centre Local Court on Monday, magistrate Susan Horan committed the two 20-year-olds to stand trial in the Supreme Court where the case will be mentioned on September 1.
