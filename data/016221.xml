  <title>Raceday focus: Flemington</title>
  <content>
JOHN Allen has made such inroads while in Australia he's regarded as one of the most talented jockeys in the state.

SATURDAY BEST:
THE EARLY OIL:
RACE WATCH:
HOT TIPS:
He's won two Group 1 races but amazingly he's yet to win a race at either Flemington or Caulfield.
On Saturday Allen should be able to tick off one of those boxes with three good rides at headquarters.
Allen has three rides for Darren Weir and they are KILLARNEY KID (R4, No. 2 $4), YOGI (R6, No. 7 $3.10) and BUT IT'S TRUE (R7, No. 17 $11).
Lloyd Williams will unveil three of his horses who are being aimed at feature staying races, BONDI BEACH (R4, No. 1 $7), ALOFT (R4, No. 5 $4.60) and AMRALAH (R8, No. 1 $8.50).
The camp hasn't spoken about their prospects but have alerted stewards with their intentions regarding riding tactics.
In the fourth race they want Aloft to lead and Bondi Beach to be ridden positively. They also want Amralah to race forward.
BEST BET

YOGI (R6, No. 7 $3.10)
Emerging staying prospect who is crying out for 2500m at Flemington.
NEXT BEST

SHOW A STAR (R8, No. 11 $4.50)
Model of consistency getting back to his favourite distance. Also races well at Flemington.
BEST VALUE

SEATTLE PARK (R10, No. 10 $17)
Was going to go close last start at Caulfield when he clipped heels in the straight. Drawn out but will go back and come with one run.
THE BETTING

There's been some solid moves at Flemington. Best move for the day has been EUREKA STREET (R10, No. 9) in the tenth race who has been $11 into $4.60.
REBELLIOUS LORD (R7, No. 13) has firmed from an opening quote of $5.50 into $2.80.
In the same race WAYANKA (R7, No. 14) has been $19 into $6.50.
YOGI (R6, No. 7) has been $4 into $3.10.
THE TRAINER

ARCHIE ALEXANDER

SURVIVED (R6, No. 1 $26)
"It's his first run since he won the Mount Gambier Cup. He's had two trials and while he's got a big weight he prefers carrying bigger weights against lesser company. He's well suited in this."
AZURITE (R6, No. 3 $11)
"He's going from winning a midweeker to Saturday but he's great form. He has a bad gate but he's good enough to run top four."
SPUNLAGO (R7, No. 6 $9)
"He's been a handy pick-up for the stable. He should have won last start. He's going really well and I'd love to see him win."
SHOW A STAR (R8, No. 11 $4)
"He's in great form. The winner last start got a length or two in front of him and that made all the difference. He races well at Flemington where he's won over this distance. With lightweight he'll take beating."
