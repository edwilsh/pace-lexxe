  <title>Jeans means signs of hope for kids</title>
  <content>
TAKE the chance to embrace denim on denim for Jeans for Genes Day.
Friday's fundraiser encourages Aussies to don denim to help raise money for the Children's Medical Research Institute, which finds cures for childhood diseases.
Scarlett, 3, and mum Naomi Sheldon will bake cupcakes to raise money.
Scarlett has Russell Silver syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that means she fails to grow and gain weight as expected.
Ms Sheldon said research could help her daughter lead a long and healthy life.
"Without CMRI, diseases like RSS would never be found or have a cure," she said.
The duo hope to top last year's efforts in selling 700 cupcakes and raising more than $2000.
The fundraiser is channelling money into a world-first research initiative to better diagnose cancer patients.
