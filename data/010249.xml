  <title>Division over crocodile removal near Four Mile Beach in far north Queensland</title>

Some locals and visitors at a popular far north Queensland beach are unfazed about the risk of crocodiles, despite one being caught in a trap around the corner this week.
Department of Environment and Heritage Protection (DEHP) wildlife officers .

The trap was set last month after a large crocodile was seen swimming near the top of the town's popular Four Mile Beach.
It was not the first time a crocodile has been spotted off Four Mile - there have been several croc attacks on dogs this year and the beach was also closed in April after a 4m reptile was spotted swimming offshore.
Long-term visitors to the region, Tom and Chris Dermott, were at the beach the day it was temporarily closed due to the crocodile sighting last month.
"It does make you a little bit nervous about going in, but it doesn't happen very often," Ms Dermott said.
"[The crocodiles have] never come close enough to the water to scare me. But I wouldn't swim anywhere where the lifesaver isn't watching carefully."
The region was only recently rezoned under the Queensland Crocodile Management Plan, which means crocodiles seen in the Four Mile area can be immediately targeted for removal.
Some locals disagree with crocodile removal

Queensland Environment Minister Steven Miles said the 2.6m crocodile that was caught this week was not the specimen seen swimming at Four Mile last month.
"Wildlife officers do not believe this was the target animal and so the trap will remain deployed for the time being," he said.

Port Douglas local Ali Wright works at a restaurant located right opposite to where the Dickson Inlet trap remains.
She said saltwater crocodiles were known by locals to live and swim in the inlet.
"In terms of [our restaurant], the tourists like the crocodiles. They like watching them. Anytime they're around, it's a big attraction," she said.
"We had one swimming right near the trap recently. He came up right near the restaurant in the afternoon. It was very entertaining."
Ms Wright said Dickson Inlet was "nowhere near" Four Mile Beach and challenged the need to remove crocodiles from the inlet, where nobody swims.
"I think we're in their territory and we need to learn to live with them."
Douglas Shire Mayor Julia Leu helped push for the region's recent crocodile management rezoning.
She said the removal of the 2.6m crocodile was evidence the rezoning changes were needed, if the animal was actually posing a threat to Four Mile beachgoers.
"I am concerned that the crocodile that had been targeted has still not been trapped," she said.
"In terms of Dickson Inlet, we only really want crocodiles to be removed if they are posing a threat to the inlet. In many parts of Dickson Inlet, they're in their natural habitat."
