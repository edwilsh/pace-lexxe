  <title>Surgery for Selwood: Cats hit with massive blow</title>

Selwood hurt and assisted off
The Cats skipper appears to have a bad leg injury

Geelong skipper Joel Selwood will miss the rest of the home and away season

GEELONG captain Joel Selwood will have surgery on his left ankle after scans confirmed he suffered a syndesmosis injury in Friday night's 46-point loss to Sydney.

However, the club expects the 29-year-old to be available in time for the finals.

Selwood, who was on crutches over the weekend, hurt ankle in two separate incidents against the Swans.

He first rolled the outside of his ankle when he stood on teammate Zac Smith's foot in a marking contest late in the second quarter.

Selwood was unable to put weight on his left foot as he left the field in the hands of the club's medicos.

He had his ankle strapped and performed a fitness test in the rooms during the main break, before starting the third quarter on the ground.

Selwood then suffered the more severe injury to the same ankle late in the third term as his leg got caught under a Buddy Franklin tackle - this time twisting inwards - which left him hobbling at three-quarter time.

The tough skipper began the last term on the ground but was wrapped in cotton wool a few minutes later, with the club deciding to not risk him further.

Speaking post-match, Cats coach Chris Scott painted a rosy picture of Selwood's injury.

"I'm actually confident enough now to say he'll be fine," Scott said.

"Clearly in the last quarter the discussion was around whether we should be pushing him through and make his chances of playing next week lower. So, given that, we sit here pretty confident that he will be OK."
