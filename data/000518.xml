A new search has begun in bushland south of Sydney for the body of missing schoolgirl Quanne Diec who disappeared almost two decades ago.
Quanne was 12 years old when she went missing on her way to school at Granville in Sydney's west in July 1998.
She left her home of Seventh Street and began walking towards Clyde railway station.
She never arrived at school and was reported missing by her parents that afternoon.
Strike Force Lyndey was set up to investigate her disappearance.
Vinzent Tarantino, 49, who is also known as Victor Gerada, was charged with her kidnapping and murder last year and the matter is still before the courts.
Tarantino lived several hundred metres from the Diec family home at the time and police allege he knew the missing girl's movements and deliberately targeted her.
Officers from the Rosehill Local Area Command and the Forensic Services Group will undertake a three-day search off Appin Road in Cataract looking for her remains.
Previous searches failed to provide breakthrough

In November 2016, police searched an address at Granville for Quanne's body without success.
They also searched an area of bushland south of Appin Road at Bulli Tops for several days without locating any remains.
It is unclear what has lead to a new search being conducted at Cataract which is not far from the Bulli Tops location.
A NSW Police statement said police remain focused on finding Quanne's remains in the hope of ending the Diec family's search for answers.
"The process has been an incredibly difficult experience for her family and we will continue to support them as the search continues," it said.
In 1999, the NSW Government increased the reward being offered for information leading to the location of Quanne from $100,000 to $200,000.
