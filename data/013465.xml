  <title>Prepare for a gala extravaganza</title>
  <content>
ONE of the jewels in the Carlton Mid Darwin Cup Carnival's crown is Saturday night's Qantas Darwin Turf Club Gala Ball.
A crowd of more than 2000 are set to be wowed at the largest outdoor ball in the Southern Hemisphere.
Held on the lawns at Skycity Darwin's Little Mindil, the entertainment is led by ARIA award-winning recording artist Anthony Callea, who will pave the way for the Dan Hamill Experience, ensuring guests dance the night away to big band, Motown medleys.
In attendance this year will be Darwin couple Justin Beugalaar and Savannah Kelly. "It's one of Darwin's premier events that everyone looks forward to," Ms Kelly said.
"Like any girl I really enjoy dressing up, getting all glammed and look forward to mingling with different people and having a good time."
Sky Racing's Greg Radley is hosting the night and will lead the charge in celebrating Monday's 61st running of the Carlton Mid Darwin Cup.
Darwin Turf Club chief executive Keith Stacy said the ball was a true showcase of Territory hospitality. "It's the perfect lead into the crescendo of the Carlton Mid Darwin Cup," he said.
