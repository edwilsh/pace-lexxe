  <title>'Cash me ousside' girl faces court on string of charges</title>
  <content>
HE went viral for her foul-mouthed appearance on Dr Phil. Now Danielle Bregoli - aka the 'cash me ousside' teen - has faced court on a string of charges.

The 15-year-old was today sentenced to five years probation after pleading guilty to grand theft, weed possession and filing a false police report in a Florida court.

TMZ is reporting that Bregoli faced the charges from incidents prior to her appearance on Dr Phil, which went viral last year.

But she's not entirely out of trouble - she could still face charges for "battery" after another incident in Florida, the gossip site reports.

Then aged 14, the troubled teen rose to internet fame in 2016 when she appeared on an episode of Dr Phil, threatening audience members with the words "cash me ousside, how bow dah" (aka "catch me outside, how about that").

She appearaed at a hearing at South County Courthouse, in Delray Beach, to hear her punishment for offences she committed before her meteoric rise to fame.

She admitted grand theft, grand theft auto, possession of marijuana and filing a false report in a hearing in June.

The notoriously wayward teen, who is now based in Los Angeles, has been filming her own reality TV show.
