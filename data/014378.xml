  <title>Grand plans for iconic pub</title>
  <content>
RESIDENTS will stage a public meeting later this month to air concerns about a decaying, iconic Brisbane pub and plans for a major redevelopment of the site.

Resident Rob Friend said he had watched as Woolloongabba's Broadway Hotel deteriorated since developer the Majella Group bought the heritage-listed icon, which features a distinctive mansard roof and WWII bunkers at the rear.

"It was boarded up after the (2010) fire and has been used as a temporary accommodation source by homeless people,'' he said.

"This is part of a bigger issue about owners of heritage buildings appropriately managing them.''

Councillor Jonathan Sri (Gabba) said he was particularly concerned about the loss of public green space and the council's decision to let Majella go up to 27 levels, even though the Neighbourhood Plan imposed a 20-storey height limit, in return for Majella giving the council part of the property for road widening.

"If we are to create a connected city where people know their neighbours, we need to do better,'' he said.

"This is a big development with very limited setbacks.

"We do want to see the site developed and see part of the hotel retained and renovated, but we just think it can be done better.''

Majella, which recently submitted a development application, wants to build 262 units, with 379 car spaces, and 40 commercial spaces on the 3420sq m Logan Rd site. Profits would fund restoration of the hotel, which would include a bar.

CEO Sebastian Monsour said the 2010 fire occurred before Majella bought it but said "we are committed to bringing to life the character of the Broadway Hotel - it was the historic hotel that attracted us to the site''.

He said heritage architect David Carter was involved with all design decisions.
