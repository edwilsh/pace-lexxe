The Matildas have completed a stunning clean sweep of the Tournament Of Nations with a 6-1 victory over football giants Brazil in the US on Friday morning (AEST).

The Australian women's team claimed the silverware in the third and deciding match after overcoming the same team that knocked them out of last year's Rio Olympics in a quarter-final penalty shootout.

This result in Californian city Carson follows wins during the last week against 2015 World Cup finalists Japan (4-2) in San Diego and No.1 ranked US (1-0) in Seattle.
It was the Matildas first trophy since the 2010 Asian Cup.
Newcastle's Emily van Egmond again played the full 90 minutes, picking up a yellow card after 20 minutes, while Jets left edge player Gema Simon came off the bench in the closing stages. Jets midfielder Chloe Logarzo started but was taken off with an ankle injury in the 29th minute.
Lisa De Vanna and Caitlin Foord both scored doubles for the Matildas while also finding the back of the net were Katrina Lee-Gorry and Samantha Kerr, who scored a hat-trick last start. They were 4-1 up at half-time.
The Australian squad wore black armbands in honour of respected football broadcaster Les Murray, who passed away earlier this week.
Newcastle will host the Matildas on September 19 for a friendly against Brazil at McDonald Jones Stadium.
