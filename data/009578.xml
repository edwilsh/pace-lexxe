  <title>Rio Tinto's first-half profit jumps 93 per cent to $4.1b</title>
  <content>
A resurgence in demand from China has almost doubled Rio Tinto's first-half profit, but still left the market disappointed.

Key points:

$US3b returned to shareholders via record interim dividend, share buy-back
Dividend to swell further once coal assets sold
Iron ore earnings up almost 90pc driven by 42pc price rise over past year

Rio announced an interim underlying profit of $US3.94 billion ($4.95bn), up from $2.01 billion last year but down on the market consensus forecast of $2.15 billion.
Stripping out one of items, net profit came in at $4.14 billion, up from $2.13 billion in 2016.
While earnings came in a bit light on expectations, a doubling of free cash flow to $5.78 billion delivered a stronger-than-expected flow of dividends.
The interim dividend jumped to a record 110 US cents per share, compared to the 45 US cents paid a year ago.
The company also expanded its existing $628 million share buy-back by $1.25 billion.
Rio Tinto chief executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques said the focus of the result was delivering disciplined and superior cash returns to shareholders.
"The $US3 billion return of cash to shareholders today shows our strategy is working, but we believe there is more we can do," Mr Jacques said.
