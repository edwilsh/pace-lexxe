  <title>New $5m grains research hub to be built in WA</title>
  <content>
A world-class grains hub will be built in Western Australia to develop research in crop pathology and genetics.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and Water Barnaby Joyce announced the establishment of the crop research hub alongside West Australian Minister for Agriculture and Food Alannah MacTiernan in Perth on Wednesday.
The project will be established with a $3 million Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) grant, with $1.5 million from Murdoch University, $250,000 from Curtain University and $250,000 from the WA Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development.
Funds will go towards the construction of infrastructure at Murdoch University and Curtain University sites, including glasshouses and an irrigated crop plot.
Glasshouses at Curtain University will be under strict quarantine, to be used for pathogen studies in partnership with the institution's existing disease research facility.
Murdoch University deputy vice chancellor of research and innovation David Morrison said the investment provided a platform for research that made a difference "on a global scale".
Professor Morrison said research would focus on improving crop productivity and disease resistance.
