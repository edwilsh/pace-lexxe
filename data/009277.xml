Both men, aged in their 30s, were remanded in custody, to appear before the Rockhampton Magistrates Court via video-link at 2pm on September 21.

The prosecution were unable to confirm where the men will be held in custody until their next court date.

One of the accused is a 35 year-old Doolandella man, the other a 37-year-old Eight Mile Plains man.

Rockhampton Police Criminal Investigation Bureau officer-in-charge Detective Senior Sergeant Luke Peachey could not give further details of the case, but said investigations were ongoing.

Snr Sgt Peachey yesterday told media a police drug dog searched the vehicle, and detected the drugs in a back compartment under the third row of a Toyota Kluger.

He said the wholesale value of the ice was $900,000, but the street value is expected to be significantly higher.

Nguyen and Tran were not previously known to police, and were on their way back to Brisbane when they were arrested.

Snr Sgt Peachey said it was the largest seizure he had seen in his time working in Central Queensland.

Police are investigating whether the drugs were produced in Rockhampton.
