  <title>Google Play Will Bury Unstable, Crappy Apps In Favour Of 'Higher Quality' Ones</title>

Both Google Play and the App Store are now saturated to the point that picking the right app for the job comes down to trial and error. Given two apps of equal functionality and price, you're going to want the faster, more stable one. Reviews can help make the decision, but Google is going a step further by tweaking its search algorithms to favour "higher quality" products.

Google Play product manager Andrew Ahn :

So, along with the usual data of keywords, reviews and other bits and pieces, Google has "enhanced [its] search and discovery algorithms" to better "reflect app quality":

Ahn goes on to say that his change will ultimately help developers as well. You could have the best app in the world, but if it crashes on a customer's device, they're probably going to hit you with a single-star review, even if the problem is on the user's side. So this should give developers more reason to make compatibility and stability a priority, the reward being better discoverability.

Well, that's the theory anyway.
