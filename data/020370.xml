  <title>Memorial paddle-out for little Kawa</title>
  <content>
A MEMORIAL beach paddle-out has been held for a girl who died in Perth last month after falling into a pool in Bali.
Kawa Leaf Sweeney, 3, died after doctors said they could not save her, and her life support was switched off.
Parents Des Sweeney and Dee Tang, from Newport on Sydney's northern beaches, last week announced a paddle-out memorial would take place today at Newport Beach.
The couple urged people who wanted to take part to wear white, Hawaiian or floral shirts and bring flowers, leaves and shells.
After two nights at Princess Margaret Hospital, Kawa was unresponsive to physical tests.
Kawa fell into the pool of the Bali resort where her family was staying.
When she was pulled from the water, Cottesloe surgeon Grant Booth performed emergency resuscitation on the child for 45 minutes until medical help arrived.
