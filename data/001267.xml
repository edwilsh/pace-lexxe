The British conservative Enoch Powell once famously said that all political careers end in failure, and that was certainly true of his own.
This judgment was based on a profoundly tragic view of human nature. It assumed that politicians are incapable of behaving in a dignified manner.
It assumed that they carry within them the seeds of their own destruction: that the same grit and determination that drives them to the highest political echelons prevents them from leaving power except by compulsion, often in humiliating circumstances.

Powell's observation applies to all the major political figures of the modern era: from Australian prime ministers like Gough Whitlam, Malcolm Fraser, Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, to other western leaders, such as David Cameron, Francois Hollande, Nicolas Sarkozy, George W Bush and Helen Clark.
Even the mighty fall, and they fall mighty hard. Who can forget Margaret Thatcher climbing into her prime ministerial car for the final time after 11 years in 10 Downing Street? Or John Howard, who lost not just the office he had held for nearly a dozen years, but the electoral seat he had held for more than three decades?
So, in the past 40 years or so, has any international political figure defied the Powell law that all political careers end in failure? I can think of only one: New Zealand's conservative prime minister John Key.
Key left when others would have stayed

Elected in 2008, . On December 5, 2016, he stunned the political world by cutting of his political career in, as Powell had advised, "midstream at a happy juncture".
At the time, Key was in the political stratosphere. He was odds-on favourite to win a fourth term. In three elections (2008, 2011, 2014) Key had increased his centre-right National Party's share of the national vote - even with minority governments.
Key left a government more popular than when it was elected eight years earlier. And yet he calculated that the time to go is when everyone tells you to stay.
A wise decision, especially given his government's achievements.

During his eight-year reign, the former Merrill Lynch banker had passed a productivity-enhancing economic agenda: the GST-tax switch, which lifted the GST rate to 15 per cent in exchange for cuts to top income and company tax rates; partial privatisation of electricity assets and the iconic Air New Zealand; comprehensive welfare reform; and workplace reforms that made it easier for small business to hire and fire.
During his tenure, New Zealand weathered the global financial storm from 2008 to 2009, without resorting to the type of big-spending and debt-ridden "stimulus" policies that characterised the responses of other Western nations.
Instead, Key believed in the market mantra that improving productivity is the best way to grow a nation out of recession.
The result: the budget moved towards surplus, the trans-Tasman wage disparity closed sharply, unemployment fell to 5 per cent, and growth averaged a healthy 3 to 4 per cent for his final few years in power.
As  after Key's resignation:
"Mr Key's government has been able to grow the economic pie for all New Zealanders by shying away from the redistribution instincts of Australia's political class."
On the cultural front, Key proudly embraced same-sex marriage, which his government passed in a parliamentary conscience vote, and he ensured a high proportion of talented women candidates in his conservative party's pre-selection process. At the same time, he restored knights and dames to New Zealand's honours system. However, his efforts to change the NZ flag, including its Union Jack emblem, failed at a referendum.
New Zealand politics rarely gets attention in the Australian media. But with his sudden resignation, our newspapers were awash with sympathetic headlines: "Australia can learn Key lesson", "A Kiwi lesson for Australian politicians fiddling at the margins", "The Key to New Zealand's success", "Key's resignation is the world's loss". And on the hosannas went.
No wonder he recently received an Honorary Companion in the Order of Australia - our highest Australian honour.
Listen to John Key's chat withTom Switzer to hear more about Key's premiership: from selling controversial economic reforms in a polarising and hyper-partisan climate, to confronting the challenges of the Christchurch earthquakes of 2011.
