  <title>Serena posts 50s-themed baby shower pic</title>

SERENA Williams is prepping for the arrival of her little one.
Williams, 35, hosted a fifties themed baby shower at the aptly named "Baby O Diner" with all of her famous girlfriends,
"When you and your crew go so far back to the 50's. Even then they had your back," Williams captured the snaps.
Williams, who is due this fall, wore a yellow poodle skirt with black and white polka dots ruffles underneath. She let her bump shine through in a crop top that came off the shoulders. She completed her fifties ensemble with a topknot, red scarf, chunky white pearls and black and white saddle Oxfords.
The tennis champ was joined by Ciara, La La Anthony, Eva Longoria, Kelly Rowland and sister Venus Williams for the party.
The girls also jammed with a jukebox and posed with a retro red pick-up truck.
While Williams and fiance Alexis Ohanian have yet to formally announce the baby's sex, he believes they're having a girl.
"We have our hunches," the Reddit co-founder beamed to Jimmy Kimmel in early August. "She put it really well - she won the Australian Open while pregnant, and she remarked that she feels like it has to be a girl because everything that little baby went through and handled like a champ, only a woman could be strong enough to take on."
