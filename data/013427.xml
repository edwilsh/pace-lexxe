  <content>
GREENTHUMBS have given the Edithvale Seaford Wetlands a massive boost - restoring woodland habitat as part of National Tree Day.
Friends of Edithvale Seaford Wetlands volunteers, residents and members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community planted a whopping 2000 trees.
Friends group member Rex Chugg said he was rapt more than 100 people had come along to help out.
Mr Chugg said the restored habitat would provide a major boost for birds.
President Kate Spillane said the Friends group was keen for more people to get involved in protecting the precious wetlands environment.
The Friends group will host a gathering to mark the one-year reopening of the bird hide off Edithvale Rd, Edithvale, on August 12 at noon.
Refreshments will be served and members will speak about the vital work done by the Friends group.
To get involved, phone vice president Robin Clarey on 9786 2213.
