  <title>Rejected Bachelorette reveals TV regret</title>
  <content>
THE latest woman axed on The Bachelor has opened up about the one thing she would change if she had another shot at winning Matthew "Matty J" Johnson's heart.
Rhythmical gymnast Akoulina Ktoiants, 29, suggested she regretted being too open.
"I wouldn't be so open," she toldovernight.
"I was thinking it was like speed dating, where every moment you get you (need to) make the most of it. I opened up too quickly, but I was being honest and being me."
Ktoiants said she felt "neutral" towards Matty J but recognises the decision was out of her control.
"I didn't really have a low moment - I enjoyed every second," she said.
"It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience and I made the best of every moment."
The blonde gymnastics coach says she suspects Lisa will be the last woman standing at the finale.
"She made quite an impression on him," she added.
"She is quite mysterious and I think they are a good match."
The Bachelor airs again tonight on Channel 10 at 7.30pm
