One-of-four men arrested over an alleged terror plot to bring down a plane has been released without charge.

8 MINS AGO  UPDATED JUST NOW

Federal police have spent days rifling through several properties across Sydney following the arrest on Saturday afternoon of the men on suspicion of being behind the conspiracy.

A 50-year-old man was released from police custody on Tuesday night without being charged with a criminal offence, a joint statement from the AFP and NSW Police said on Wednesday.

The remaining three suspects will stay in detention under special powers which allow police to hold them for up to a week.

"This investigation remains ongoing, and further information will be provided at an appropriate time," the statement said.

The alleged plot involved an improvised device and the target was a plane, with one theory suggesting the would-be terrorists planned to use a meat grinder to conceal their home-made device.
