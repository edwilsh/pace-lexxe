Taking the kids to play sport on Saturday or Sunday morning is one of the great and most beloved traditions of Australian life.

This weekend celebration of life is a familiar backdrop of weekends around Maitland and across Australia from the suburbs of Sydney to the tiniest hamlet.
But sometimes the story behind this most ordinary of activities can be extraordinary.

The Maitland Football For All program is one of those stories and its significance to a growing number of children and just importantly their families is growing all the time.

Maitland Football For All has been running a highly successful football program for children with autism  or learning difficulties to give them an opportunity to play team sports. 
Each Saturday club teams from across the district travel to Robins Oval to play against MFFA teams in under-7, under-9 and under-11s.
One of the greatest positives of the program is that the children involved in the visiting teams get as much fun and rewards from participating as do the MFFA kids.

 "This year we have been lucky enough to field three teams, an under 7s an under 9s and an under 11s," Maitland Football For All president Jenny Schiemer said.
"Our children have really improved and their self confidence and self-esteem has grown tremendously."

"We were successful in obtaining two grants this year, which we used to purchase some much needed equipment for game days."
