  <content>
Just three months after they moved to Rosebud, Betty Gardiner's beloved husband, Kevin, died. 
But instead of going back to Melbourne, the newly bereaved widow decided to stay put on the Mornington Peninsula.

Rosebud has the highest proprotion of widows

Census data shows more than one in 10 adults in the seaside town are widows.

"I had a big decision to make: whether I'd stay here or I'd go back to Pascoe Vale where all my friends were," Ms Gardiner, now 90, says.

"So I decided I'd stay here." 

And according to new data, Ms Gardiner's situation is not unusual.

A Fairfax Media analysis of census data shows the Rosebud area, in Melbourne's south-east, has the highest proportion of widows in the state.
In Rosebud, more than one in 10 adults are widows, and 53 per cent of the population is female.
In neighbouring Rosebud West, now known as Capel Sound, 569 women - more than one quarter of the female adult population - are widows.

It would appear that many of the female residents have outlived their husbands. A total of 389 of them are older than 80 and there are six widows aged over 100. 
There also 176 widowed men in the area, the analysis shows.
The suburb skews older than most Melbourne suburbs and has a median age of 59, 22 years older than the median age for Victoria.
Other areas with a high proportion of widowed people are Junction Village in Melbourne's south-east, North Geelong, Wonthaggi and Sorrento.
Mornington Peninsula Shire mayor Bev Colomb says the numbers come as no surprise. 
"We do know that we have a higher percentage of older people on the peninsula and that trend has been there for quite some time," Cr Colomb says. 
"It is not a huge surprise ... and it is something we have been preparing for for quite sometime."
Cr Colomb says the council's aim is to meet the needs of the elderly in the community in particular, for mobility and social inclusion.  
"If you are thinking of widows ... these are people who have gone from living with a partner to living, often, on their own," she says. 
"It is really important they still feel an active part of the communities that they are in, that they are being listened to and that they can go out and about whenever they wish and they have vibrant townships with great activities that they can attend."
Cassandra Szoeke, who heads the Women's Healthy Ageing Project at the University of Melbourne, says being socially engaged and having a network is important for healthy ageing. 
"Isolation, and in particular, social isolation, has been associated with earlier death and poorer health," Professor Szoeke says. 
"Being a widow, particularly when we talk about people who are 80 or 90 ... they may well have been with ... their partners ...[for] five decades.
"So there is a window of risk. When a person's long-term partner dies, they actually have a higher chance of death in the next few years."
After losing her husband, Ms Gardiner says that, at first, all she wanted to do was "rest".
But her friends had other ideas, urging her to get involved in the Rosebud RSL Club's women's auxiliary.
"When my husband passed away, I thought the end of the world had come," she says. "But, you've got to get out. 
"Every Friday we play [card game] crazy whist ....on Saturday I go to bingo ...there's about four, five of us sit together, we have a chat, a cup of tea together. 
"I had a lovely lot of friends in Pascoe Vale, too, but I have made a lovely lot down here, and I am so glad I stayed."
