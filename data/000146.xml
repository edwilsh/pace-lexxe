  <title>Baltimore police corruption scandal swells as more cases are thrown out</title>
  <content>
Baltimore has thrown out 34 criminal cases as authorities investigate.
Approximately 123 cases are under review after body camera video appeared to show an officer planting illicit drugs at a crime scene.
Baltimore's state attorney Marilyn Mosby said her office has dismissed or will dismiss cases that soley relied on the officers' credibility.
Seventy-seven cases are still under review, while 12 other cases are moving forward, Mosby said.
"As I have stated before, it is incumbent upon us as prosecutors to be the ministers of justice and to do what's right in the pursuit of justice, over convictions, while simultaneously prioritizing public safety," she said.
The cases dropped were felony drug and free-standing firearms cases.
Following the discovery of the video one officer was suspended and two others were placed on desk duty while the Office of Professional Responsibility completes its investigation.

At a news conference on Wednesday, Baltimore Police Department Commissioner Kevin Davis said he wasn't concerned the video could jeopardize other cases.
"This is a serious allegation of police misconduct," Davis said.
"There's nothing that deteriorates the trust of any community more than thinking for more than one second that uniformed police officers - and police officers in general - would plant evidence of crimes on citizens."
