  <title>Blue Ocean Equities raising for LiveTiles</title>
  <content>
ASX-listed subscription software company LiveTilles is in front of institutional and sophisticated investors on Monday, seeking a $6 million equity injection. 
The company's broker Blue Ocean Equities sent terms to potential investors on Monday morning. 
LiveTiles is seeking to raise $6 million at 18Â¢ a share, which was a 14.3 per cent discount to the last close and a 21.4 per cent disocunt to the 30-day volume weighted average price. 
The offer left room for another $2 million to be raised via oversubscriptions. 

Funds raises were to invest in sales and marketing teams, according to the term sheet sent to potential investors. 

Blue Ocean was seeking bids by midday on Tuesday. 
LiveTiles had a $32 million market capitalisation prior to Monday's raising.
