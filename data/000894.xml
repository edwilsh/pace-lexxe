  <title>Origin Energy doubles petroleum sales </title>
  <content>
Origin Energy has more than doubled annual sales of oil and gas, driven primarily by the ramp-up of its APLNG venture in Queensland but also reflecting growth in the conventional oil and gas business about to be spun off as Lattice Energy.
Full-year sales in oil and gas in 2016-17 reached $2.2 billion, up from $1.08 billion on a year earlier, thanks to both higher prices and production.
Revenues excluding APLNG, which will remain with the parent company after the Lattice sale, increased 26 per cent to $746.9 million.
Sales from Origin's 37.5 per cent interest in APLNG surged by almost $1 billion to $1.46 billion.

, with a decision expected by September.

Several parties are understood to be in the bidding process for Lattice, including a venture involving Beach Energy. , which are likely to be developed for the LNG market.
Production from the oil and gas activities rose 40 per cent overall, to 232 petajoules, helped by the start-up of the second production unit at APLNG last October and the beginning of production at the Halladale/Speculant project off the south-east coast.
Chief executive Frank Calabria said the uplift in output and sales "reflects strong operational performance across our upstream operations".
, paving the way for some $US3.4 billion of shareholder guarantees for the project debt to be released this September quarter.

In the June quarter, production rose 30 per cent from a year earlier to 89.2 petajoules, which was also up 12 per cent on the March quarter. APLNG shipped 33 cargoes in the June quarter.
Shares in Origin, which also has a large utilities business whose revenues aren't included in the quarterly report, were up 5Â¢ at $6.91 at 10:27am AEDT.
