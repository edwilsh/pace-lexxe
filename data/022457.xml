  <title>Jury discharged in road rage manslaughter trial after being unable to reach a verdict</title>
  <content>
The jury in the road rage trial of Tamate Heke has been discharged after failing to reach a majority verdict.

Jurors deliberated for about 10 hours to determine if the New Zealand national was guilty of killing Shane Merrigan in a roadside confrontation on the Gateway Motorway on December 1, 2015.

The jury passed two notes to Justice Peter Applegarth this afternoon saying they had reached an impasse and then later that they were deadlocked.

Justice Applegarth told them the court would take a majority verdict of 11 to one but the jury was unable to reach that.
Mr Heke pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and the alternate charge of unlawful striking causing death.

Justice Applegarth thanked the jury for their service before dismissing them.

"It was a difficult case," he told them.

A mention date for Mr Heke will now be set.
