  <title>Vic police hunt high-vis 'tradie' flasher</title>
  <content>
A young man wearing a fluoro orange "tradie" jumper is wanted by police for exposing himself to a teenage girl at a Melbourne bus top.
The girl was waiting for a bus at Bundoora last Wednesday when the flasher, aged between 16 and 19, walked past her several times before stopping and exposing himself, police say.
The girl fled and called police but a patrol of the area did not locate him.
