  <title>State's weather records tumble</title>
  <content>
QUEENSLAND has recorded its hottest July on record despite the state also shivering through the coldest day in two years.
Bureau of Meteorology figures released on Tuesday show the mean temperature across the state was 2.65C above the long-term average of 15.94 per cent.
Maximum average temperatures were also more than 3 per cent above the average of 22.95C, with more than 40 weather stations in coastal and outback regions topping or equalling their record mean maximum temperature.
Mackay and St George broke warm-weather records, with the mercury in St George reaching 28.7C on July 30 - well above the July average of 19.5C.
The minimum temperatures across the state were generally above average but Brisbane and Warwick in the southeast recorded their lowest temperature since 2015 on July 24.
Meteorologist David Crock says high temperatures should continue for the rest of winter and well into spring.
"The three-month climate outlook from August until October certainly suggests that warmer-than-average conditions will continue," he told AAP. However, he said it was too early to tell if Queensland was in for a scorching summer.
