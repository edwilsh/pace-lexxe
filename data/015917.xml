  <title>Men accused of kidnap, attempted murder</title>
  <content>
A 35-year-old man is in a serious condition after he was allegedly kidnapped, put in the back of a ute and significantly burned.
Police say he was with a 36-year-old man when they were both grabbed in northern NSW on July 23.
However, the 36-year-old managed to escape by jumping from the moving ute and hiding in nearby bushland.
About 7.30pm that night, a motorist noticed the 35-year-old and a spot fire on the side of the road, and a burnt-out white Holden Commodore utility was later found at the scene, police say.
The man, who had significant burns, was airlifted to Royal Brisbane Hospital where he remains in a serious condition.
Police investigating the incident this week charged a 29-year-old man and a 28-year-old man.
They say further arrests are expected.
