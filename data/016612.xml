  <title>WA Police award honours sacrifice in duty</title>
  <content>
Constable Matt Butcher, who was permanently paralysed from injuries inflicted in a brawl he was trying to stop outside a Perth tavern in 2008, is among the West Australian police awarded a medal honouring their service on Friday.
The Police Star recognises the sacrifice of 78 men and women who died or were seriously injured in the line of duty, serving as a reminder of how dangerous it can be on the frontline, Police Minister Michelle Roberts says.
Constable Gavin Capes, First Class Constable David Dewar and Senior Constables Donald Everett and Philip Ruland, who died in a plane crash on Australia Day in 2011, were granted the medal posthumously.
The star was introduced in January but other states have had similar recognition for fallen and injured officers for more than 10 years.
