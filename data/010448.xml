  <title>When will these cold mornings end?</title>
  <content>
MELBURNIANS have woken to a frosty morning as the temperature dips to just 3C.
But if it feels colder than that - you're not wrong.
The Bureau of Meteorology said this morning felt more like 1.6C.
Today's maximum will only just crack the double digits at 11C but those in Mt Dandenong will shiver through the day at just 7C.
Morning frost replaced yesterday's thick fog and Melburnians are urged to pack their umbrella as the city is set for an afternoon drenching.
Showers will arrive this afternoon and into the evening, with 3-8mm forecast.
And it seems the rain is here to stay with showers expected to continue until Monday next week.
