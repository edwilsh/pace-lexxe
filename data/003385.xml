  <title>Resi lending surges by $10bn in June</title>
  <content>
The total volume of residential lending amongst the banks, including owner occupier and investor loans, has shot past $1.57trn, according to the newest figures from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority ().
The regulator's latest Monthly Banking Statistics show that total lending increased by $9.8bn (or 0.6%) between May and June.
Owner occupier loans sat at just over $1trn and represented 64.8% of total loans as of June. This was an increase of $7.4bn (or 0.7%) from the month before.
The remaining $552bn (or 35.2% of total lending) was made up of investment loans - an increase of $2.4bn (or 0.4%) from the previous month.
The big four banks held $1.3trn in residential lending in June or 82.6% of the total banking market share. Of this, $825bn was in owner occupier loans while $472bn was in investment lending.
The individual figures for lending at the big four banks are found below with each number listed in billions of dollars:
