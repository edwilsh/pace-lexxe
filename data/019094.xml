  <title>Usain Bolt loses out to Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman in 100m final at world athletics championships</title>
  <content>
Usain Bolt has been unable to finish his illustrious sprint career at the pinnacle of the sport, finishing third behind Justin Gatlin in the 100m sprint at the world athletics championships in London.
Bolt clocked a time of 9.95 to fall just short of Gatlin (9.92) and Christian Coleman (9.94) in second, after starting slowly. His final surge was not enough to overhaul Gatlin's lead.
Earlier on Sunday (AEST), Bolt had finished second by 0.01 of a second in his semi-final behind American Coleman (9.97), after coming out of the blocks slowly.
The 30-year-old had previously won every Olympic and world 100m and 200m since 2008, with the exception of the 100m at the 2011 Daegu world titles, when he false-started in the final.
More to come.
