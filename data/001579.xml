PATRICK Dangerfield's Brownlow Medal defence could be over after he was today cited by the match review panel for his tackle on Matthew Kreuzer.
Despite declaring yesterday that he "didn't think there was much in it", the Geelong superstar was today offered a one-match ban for rough conduct.
Luke Hodge has also been offered a one-game ban - his third fine of 2017 equating to an automatic suspension - while Sydney star Lance Franklin cleared over his contact with the Hawks champion.
ROBBO:
'FAIR TACKLE':
JON RALPH:
Dangerfield risks an extra week - the club's blockbuster clash with Richmond at Simonds Stadium - should he elect to challenge and fail.
The panel took video evidence and a medical report from Carlton into account and assessed the incident as "careless with medium impact to the head".
The Cats have until 11am tomorrow to decide whether they will challenge Dangerfield's ban at the AFL tribunal. If the Cats were to challenge they will risk missing an extra week.

"I actually still thought he had the ball," Dangerfield said on Channel 7 on Sunday.
"I felt it was a fair tackle. There was no umpire's call at the time.
"So I don't see an issue with it, but it's not up to me."
Kreuzer played no further part in Saturday night's game after the tackle, in which his arms were pinned and he was brought to ground.
The result means Richmond star Dustin Martin is now hot favourite to take out this year's Brownlow Medal.

Franklin's hit on Hodge was assessed but he was cleared, with the panel deeming the high contact "not a striking motion".
Taylor Adams can accept a $1000 sanction for rough conduct on Rory Laird.
