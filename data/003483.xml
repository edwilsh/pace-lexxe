  <title>Baker McKenzie promotes Aussie to oversee Asia-Pac TMT</title>
  <content>
Baker McKenzie partner Adrian Lawrence has been tapped to take over as technology, media and telecommunications group leader for the Asia-Pacific.
The Sydney-based Lawrence joined Baker McKenzie two decades ago and has been a partner since 1997. He previously worked as a research director at the Supreme Court of NSW.
Lawrence regularly acts for a number of major Silicon Valley-based online platforms as well as other leading technology and media interests such as the Motion Picture Association, HT&E (previously APN) and the ABC.
He has also been active in the Australian fintech market with clients such as SocietyOne, OnDeck and Acorns.

Lawrence is the second Sydney-based TMT lawyer at Baker McKenzie to get tapped.

In April, , formally senior counsel at Nine Entertainment, was elevated to national head of intellectual property, technology, media and content at the law firm.
