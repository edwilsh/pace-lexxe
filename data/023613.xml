  <title>National selection beckons for Jacob</title>
  <content>
JACOB Richards will be a step closer to his dream of playing for Australia when he goes to Canberra to train at Basketball Australia's Centre of Excellence.
The Year 10 MacKillop College student has been selected in an 18-member squad to participate in the selection camp for the Australian Crocs who will play in the under-16 Asia Cup, the dates for which are yet to be finalised.
Richards is eager about the tryouts, which run from September 4-6, and is looking forward to training with and against the best in his age group.
"It will be good to see how I go against the top players for my age," the 16-year-old said.
"I'm excited to compete against them and test myself."
The squad will be cut down from 18 to a final 12 and Richards believes he can make the team to represent the Australian Crocs.
"I think I can make it, I am giving myself a chance," Richards said.
After being selected in the under-18 Tasmanian team that played in the junior championships in Townsville last April, Richards hopes this selection is another step towards his main goals.
"My career goals in basketball are to play for Australia and play in the NBA," the power forward said.
Richards is one of three Tasmanians selected for the camp along with Taran Armstrong and Hunter Clarke.
Clarke is already training in Canberra as a part of the AIS and Armstrong and Richards will be making the journey to the nation's capital together.
