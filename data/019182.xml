  <title>What do results so far mean for your team?</title>
  <content>
THE ground has already shifted after some huge results in Round 20, and there could be a lot more to come.
The  and  were both staring at 2018 mortality late in the final quarter yesterday but rallied to keep their top eight hopes alive.
MARCUS BONTEMPELLI:
, Melbourne has a huge fight on its hands and how bad was ?
Scroll down to see what Round 20 results mean for your team, and a preview of what's to come in the closest season in memory.
1. ADELAIDE 54pts, 137.1%

R20: Port Adelaide (AO)
R21: Essendon (ES)
R22: Sydney (AO)
R23: West Coast (S)
Our prediction: Extremely tough run of games, but it would take a major slip up to fall out of the top two.
2. GWS GIANTS 52pts, 115.3%

R21: Western Bulldogs (ES)
R22: West Coast (SPO)
R23: Geelong (SS)
Our prediction: Did the Demons play them back into form? Bad news for the rest of the comp. Like the Crows have a tricky run home but on yesterday's form they could win all three.
3. GEELONG 50pts, 115.1%

R21: Richmond (SS)
R22: Collingwood (MCG)
R23: GWS Giants (SS)
Our prediction: Dangerfield is back next week but they could be without Joel Selwood and Tom Hawkins But will two games to come at home and just a trip down the road to the MCG, top two still possible.
4 RICHMOND 48pts, 113.7%

R20: Hawthorn (MCG)
R21: Geelong (SS)
R22: Fremantle (S)
R23: St Kilda (MCG)
Our prediction: MASSIVE day today. Tigers win and Power loses and a top-four spot is nearly assured. Can overtake the Cats and set up a monster Simonds Stadium blockbuster next week. While the Giants' return to form isn't ideal, they have a tough run. Could the Tigers play a home qualifying final?
5. PORT ADELAIDE 44pts, 130.8%

R20: Adelaide (AO)
R21: Collingwood (AO)
R22: Western Bulldogs (EU)
R23: Gold Coast (AO)
Our prediction: Huge percentage keeps Port in hunt for top four. Needs to beat Adelaide to keep pressure on Tigers.
6. SYDNEY 44pts, 117.2%

R21: Fremantle (SCG)
R22: Adelaide (AO)
R23: Carlton (SCG)
Our prediction: Home, sweet home for the finals and could snare fourth with a win against Adelaide. Hard to believe the Swans were 0-6.
7. WESTERN BULLDOGS 44pts, 101.1%

R21: GWS Giants (ES)
R22: Port Adelaide (EU)
R23: Hawthorn (ES)
Our prediction: The Dogs don't mind seventh spot one bit. Back in the eight after four wins on the trot, but the Dogs must win two more and while they are all at home there are no gimmes.
8. ESSENDON 40pts, 107.3%
R21: Adelaide (ES)
R22: Gold Coast (MS)
R23: Fremantle (ES)
Our prediction: Squeaked home against the Blues but has the easiest draw of teams chasing ladder positions 6-8. Will drop out of the eight today if West Coast beats St Kilda.
9. WEST COAST 40pts, 105.9%

R20: St Kilda (ES)
R21: Carlton (S)
R22: GWS Giants (SPO)
R23: Adelaide (S)
Our prediction: Can't trust them. Need three wins to be safe in the top eight so must beat the Saints today.
10. MELBOURNE 40pts, 104.8%
R21: St Kilda (MCG)
R22: Brisbane Lions (MCG)
R23: Collingwood (MCG)
Our prediction: Biggest loser from Round 20 so far. Teetering after just two wins from past five starts. St Kilda next week is now do-or-die.
11. ST KILDA 36pts 96.7%

R20: West Coast (ES)
R21: Melbourne (MCG)
R22: North Melbourne (ES)
R23: Richmond (MCG)
Our prediction: Take out the last five minutes of last week's game against Port and yesterday's wins by Essendon and the Dogs and the Saints would be right in it. Stays in Melbourne and should win another game or two. But poor percentage means needs to win all four to make finals. Won't happen.
12. HAWTHORN 34pts, 88.8%

R20: Richmond (MCG)
R21: North Melbourne (US)
R22: Carlton (ES)
R23: Western Bulldogs (ES)
Our prediction: If Hawks can get past Tigers, then its strong run of form should still see it alive come Round 23. Still an outside chance to make finals.
