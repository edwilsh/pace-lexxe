  <title>8000 northeast Adelaide homes lose power</title>
  <content>
A problem at a substation in Adelaide's northeast has cut power to more than 8000 properties.
SA Power Networks said crews were working on the issue with an estimated time for all services to be restored put at 1.15am on Saturday.
However, in some areas the electricity was back on before midnight on Friday.
Suburbs affected included Golden Grove, Greenwith, Modbury Heights and Fairview Park.
The outage occurred ahead of severe weather across Adelaide and the Mt Lofty Ranges, with heavy rain and strong winds forecast for the weekend.
