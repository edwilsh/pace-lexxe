  <title>Finals unlikely for fading Eagles</title>
  <content>
WEST Coast's second final-quarter fade-out in three weeks has made a finals berth this season very difficult.
The Eagles lost their spot in the top eight after Sunday's eight-point loss to St Kilda at Etihad Stadium - a game they led by 22 points in the last term.
With three rounds remaining, Adam Simpson's men are in ninth spot and one of four teams with a 10-9 record.
Their run home - especially the last fortnight - is arguably the toughest of the four finals hopefuls log-jammed from eighth to 11th on the ladder.
It starts with a winnable home game against Carlton at Domain Stadium on Saturday night.
Then comes games against the two premiership favourites - GWS and Adelaide - in consecutive weeks.
West Coast snatched a win in their last visit to Spotless Stadium late last season, but that was thanks to injured ruckman Nic Naitanui's last-gap goal.
LeCras converts from distance

The Giants are second on the ladder after two wins on the trot and have had key players return in recent weeks including Stephen Coniglio, Steve Johnson and Brett Deledio.
It doesn't get any easier the following week for their last-ever game at the ageing Domain Stadium against the ladder-leading Crows.
Essendon, coming off a narrow win against the Blues, should win two of their last three games.
Their round-21 clash against Adelaide at Etihad Stadium is the toughest of the lot, but that's the only top-eight side they face coming home.
A trip to the Gold Coast to face the lowly-ranked Suns follows, before the Bombers' home-and-away season comes to a close against Fremantle at Etihad Stadium.
Melbourne and St Kilda are also on 40 points, with both teams staying in their home state for the remainder of the season.
The Demons and Saints take on each other next round at the MCG, with the latter having the more favourable draw, with Brisbane and Collingwood to come.
St Kilda's poor percentage, 10 per cent behind Essendon, hurts their cause big time - as does a final-round clash against Richmond.
Is Josh Kelly staying at GWS?

THE RUN HOME
Essendon (8th position, 10-9, 107.3%): Adelaide (home), Gold Coast (away), Fremantle (home).
West Coast (9th, 10-9, 105): Carlton (home), GWS (away), Adelaide (home).
Melbourne (10th, 10-9, 104.8): St Kilda (home), Brisbane (home), Collingwood (away).
St Kilda (11th, 10-9, 97.3): Melbourne (away), North Melbourne (home), Richmond (away).
