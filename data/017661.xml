An American woman has been arrested at Sydney airport after border force officers allegedly found two kilograms of cocaine hidden in her suitcase.
The 49-year-old woman arrived in Sydney from Los Angeles on Friday and officers chose to search her baggage.
Australian Federal Police say cocaine was hidden among clothing and make-up products in her suitcase and she was charged with importing a commercial quantity of the drug.
