"I loved that dress - I wanted to express myself that night and I did exactly that. I can take the mick out of myself so whatever anyone has got to say about me I still find it funny. I even loved the memes.
"You will absolutely see more of that in the future. If Celine Dion can rock it then why can't the GC?"

Collins also reveals she fancies Freddie Flintoff and would pursue a romance with the cricketer if he wasn't already married.
She mistook her crush for English footballer Peter Crouch when they met at the bash, but says Flintoff approached her for a chat first.
The star added: "I really fancy Freddy Flintoff. He said hello to me at that party. It's a shame he's married because he's gorgeous."

Flintoff was quick to tell his followers about the hilarious moment, posting a snap of Collins clasping a hand over her mouth.
He captioned the image: "No, I'm not Peter Crouch, but lovely to meet you."
