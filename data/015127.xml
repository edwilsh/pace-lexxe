  <title>Wilson enjoys married life on tour</title>
  <content>
LIFE can't get any better for professional surfer Julian Wilson who says he is on track in the Championship Tour and enjoying life as a married man.
The Coolum surfing product tied-the-knot to his long-time girlfriend Ashley in February and currently sits eighth on the world tour standings.
While the Coaster's competition schedule is a busy one that takes him across the world, Wilson said it was "nice" to be married and to have a support network away from the surf.
Julian married Ashley at Yandina Station.  She often travels to cheer him on from the sand.
"It's definitely nice to be married and to find that special person," Wilson said.
"We got married in February so it's all new and it's been really nice.
"Especially with all the travel that comes with being on tour, it's nice to have a partner as dedicated and committed to the relationship and supports what I do."
The 28-year-old is currently at home in Peregian on a short break from competition.
He'll hit the surf again next week at the Billabong Pro at Teahupo'o in Tahiti.
