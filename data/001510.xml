  <title>Man shoots girls in Sydney with air rifle</title>
  <content>
A man is accused of shooting at a group of teenage girls with an air rifle in Sydney's southwest on the weekend.
Police say the 28-year-old man fired shots through the open window of his white truck hitting and injuring a girl, 17, before driving off on Saturday evening.
The teenagers were standing next to the Hume Highway near Woodward Park at Liverpool when the attack occurred, police said in a statement on Monday.
The 17-year-old received a laceration to her face and swelling while two 16-year-old girls weren't injured.
The alleged shooter handed himself into police on Sunday and will face Liverpool Local Court in mid-August.
