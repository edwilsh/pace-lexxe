  <title>NAPLAN results mostly positive for WA</title>
  <content>
West Australian students are continuing to improve overall in their literacy and numeracy, according to NAPLAN testing results, but the state's education minister says there is still work to be done.
Students in Years 3, 5, 7 and 9 completed the annual national test covering numeracy, reading, grammar and punctuation, writing, and spelling.
WA Education Minister Sue Ellery said that local schools had improved in 14 of the 20 NAPLAN assessments, which was the highest of all states.
"The mean scores for WA students in 2017 were the highest we have ever achieved in numeracy (all years), reading (Years 3 and 5), spelling (Years 5 and 7) and grammar and punctuation (Year 3)," she said on Wednesday.
"WA continues to have one of the best participation rates and lowest withdrawal rates across all year groups.
"There is always room for improvement, however it is encouraging that our students are performing well compared to other students across the country."
Premier Mark McGowan said he would like to see continuous improvement over a long period of time.
