  <title>The Trip to Spain: Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan should have stayed at home</title>

The Trip to Spain
Directed by Michael Winterbottom
Rated M
111 minutes
★★★
Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan are two of the funniest men in Britain - everybody says so. But watching them eat their way through the north of England and Italy in the first two movies (The Trip and The Trip to Italy) has its limits. With Spain, the thrill is gone. If I was hitching to Malaga and saw them coming in Coogan's Range Rover, I'd retract my thumb.
The idea of these movies, each of which is a cut down of a six-part TV series, is that the Welsh Brydon and  English Coogan, playing exaggerated versions of themselves, entertain us through a series of great meals in spectacular locations by constant niggling and ever more strident impersonations of famous actors - particularly Michael Caine, Sean Connery and in this one, the late Roger Moore.
They flirt with waitresses (and in the first two movies, each had a fling) and talk about getting older, their careers, their children, their current or ex-wives, the nature of show business or the poets and writers whose footsteps they follow.
In The Trip, it was Wordsworth and Coleridge; then Byron and Shelley in Italy. In Spain, it is Cervantes and Laurie Lee, the Englishman who fought in the International Brigade in Spain in the 1930s. Coogan tells Brydon at their first seaside nosh, after the ferry docks in Santander, that he wants to write a Laurie Lee-style book about his own first trip to Spain as a young man, when he lost his virginity to a 37-year-old Spanish woman. When Brydon asks if they should look her up, Coogan says no - she is now 70 and "enormous".
That's part of the problem. Not only is Coogan less than gallant, he is positively unlikeable as this version of himself. He broods, he bullies, he sulks and he humiliates Brydon as "the lesser star", the one who does not have two Oscar nominations.

Brydon, for his part, gives plenty back - but their dialogue, nearly all of which is improvised on themes devised by the director - is more wounding than amusing. Brydon lapses into impersonations whenever things get sticky; Coogan then tries to show him how much better he can do the same personality - though most of the time, he is not quite as accurate.
In the first movie, that was fun as they clashed over rival Michael Caines. Here, it's less fun as they do the same with Mick Jagger, Ian McKellen, David Bowie and Roger Moore. If you were looking for evidence that great comedians still need a script, The Trip to Spain could be exhibit A.
Michael Winterbottom treats these films partly as scenics, this time using a drone to capture spectacular shots of little-known Spanish towns that have great restaurants (such as Cuenca).
But he has deeper things to impart as well - in this case, some ideas about the riches of Moorish Spain and the contrast with the current threat from IS. How to reconcile the Alhambra in Granada with these cut-throats? That leads him to end the film in north Africa - a choice as grating as it is puzzling.
Winterbottom has used the same pieces of melancholy music in all three films - particularly two pieces by Michael Nyman - to suggest that there is more going on here than meets the eye. That might be true, but it's far from clear what that is.
Are these films about men getting older, or simply the privileged adventures of two show-boating showmen on tour - a sort of vaudeville on wheels, with haute cuisine and low comedy? Once was fun, twice was pushing it and thrice is just tiresome.
