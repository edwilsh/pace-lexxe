  <title>Today Show broadcasting live from Coast this morning</title>
  <content>
THE Today Show will broadcast live from the Sunshine Coast this morning, as part of the region's 50th anniversary of naming celebrations. 

Today's outdoors broadcast began at 5.30am near Maroochydore Surf Life Saving Club and was worth the early start with opportunities aplenty for locals to meet the cast and crew and win cash and prizes.

Fans who attend will have the chance to be part of Dickie's Double Dip for Cash Giveaway as well as take part in a sandcastle making demo and enjoy a sneak peek performance of the 200-person choir that will perform at the anniversary concert on August 6.

The outside broadcast also features a segment on the amazing array of Sunshine Coast food and produce, where attending fans have the chance to "taste the Sunshine Coast" with a long table of the delicious produce on display.

The Maroochy Surf Club will also host a breakfast sausage sizzle, Country Chef are on hand to hand out some special birthday bakery treats and Woombye Cheese are distributing some free cheesy goodness.
