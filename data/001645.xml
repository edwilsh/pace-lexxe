  <title>Australian Dorothy chosen for Wizard of Oz</title>
  <content>
Dreams really do come true for Melbourne actress Samantha Leigh Dodemaide who has just landed the role of Dorothy in an upcoming Australian stage production of the Wizard of Oz, beating more than 400 actresses.
Dodemaide, 28, has been working in Australian musical theatre for years and has been an understudy in major productions of Singin' in the Rain, Anything Goes, Sweet Charity, A Chorus Line and King Kong, but the role of Dorothy is her biggest yet.
"Even though I've put on the dress, done the photo shoot and it's been announced, it still doesn't feel real. It's really exciting," Dodemaide told AAP.
'It's really a dream come true as corny as that sounds. I've worked my whole life for this moment."
It does seem as though Dodemaide's career has led her to play this part, made famous by legendary musical icon Judy Garland in the original 1939 MGM film.
Dodemaide starred in the musical Violet, which has been compared to The Wizard of Oz, and has also been in a production of Wicked, the Wizard of Oz spin-off musical.
"I remember watching MGM musicals on a Saturday afternoon with my Mum and that's how I got my love of music theatre, from Judy Garland, Doris Day, the classics, and who better to be inspired by than them? The Wizard of Oz was definitely a favourite," she said.
The current production had its premiere at the London Palladium in 2011, featuring the beloved Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg songs from the movie and including new songs by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber.
The Australian show, produced by John Frost and Suzanne Jones, will also star Anthony Warlow as The Wizard, Lucy Durack as Glinda the Good Witch, Jemma Rix will be The Wicked Witch of the West and a real dog will play Dorothy's companion Toto.
'Apparently I get to have some dog training before I begin to create that bond between Toto and Dorothy, obviously because Toto is Dororthy's best friend, which isn't going to be hard at all," Dodemaide said.
"If Toto needs to share my dressing room I'm more than happy for that to happen as well."
* The Wizard of Oz will open at Venue Lyric Theatre, QPAC, Brisbane on November 4 and in Sydney's Capitol Theatre, from December 30.
