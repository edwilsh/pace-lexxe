  <title>Oh, Canada Bay: Ex-CFMEU boss Andrew Ferguson faces branch stacking claims</title>
  <content>
The fractious fight for control of Canada Bay Council in the local government elections has been rocked by allegations of branch stacking, fake addresses and book walking involving controversial former CFMEU boss Andrew Ferguson, leaving Labor's ticket in disarray.
A Fairfax Media investigation has found that a number of Mr Ferguson's supporters inside the Concord branch, where Mr Ferguson is secretary, have enrolled at fictitious addresses or have crammed into the same small units to bolster the former union boss' tilt at local government.Photo: Nick Moir
Mr Ferguson secured the No.1 spot on the Labor ticket at the preselection meeting on Wednesday night. Adding to Labor's embarrassment, Opposition Leader Luke Foley is a member of the branch.

Living outside the electorate is Mr Ferguson's son Pablo Ferguson-Castro and his girlfriend Rebecca Aitken, who were at home at their Rozelle terrace in Hancock Street when Fairfax Media visited on Tuesday evening.
According to Labor's voting records, the couple share a two-bedroom apartment in Jean Wailes Avenue, Rhodes, safely inside the Canada Bay electorate, with Joyce Xu, who works with Mr Ferguson at insurance brokers Coverforce, an organisation that featured in the building royal commission due to its links with the CFMEU..

Holding back a sizeable dog, Ms Aitken said the couple were living temporarily in the Rozelle house.

When it was pointed out that they were the owners of the Rozelle property, Ms Aitken claimed the house was on "Airbnb most of the time". Fairfax Media's attempts to locate the property on Airbnb were unsuccessful.Photo: Nick Moir
According to business records, the Rozelle property, which they bought in 2013, is also listed as the headquarters for the couple's creative consultancy agency.
When asked to describe the apartment at Rhodes, Ms Aitken shut the door.
Mr Ferguson's other son, Camilo, is enrolled as living in a neighbouring Rhodes apartment block in a unit owned by Mr Ferguson's running mate Yuehan Zhang, who is expected to secure spot three on Labor's Canada Bay ticket. Two other voters - Hyojung Kim and Songpal Oh - are registered as living at Ms Zhang's property.
Ms Zhang, who goes by the name Michelle, declined to comment.
Another two-bedroom apartment in Rhodes is home to David Yu. Mr Yu, who works in construction, provides a glowing testimonial on the Coverforce website. Mr Ferguson also helped organise the February opening of Mr Yu's Chinese restaurant in Burwood, Royal Treasure Seafood Restaurant.
According to Labor's voting records, Mr Yu and his wife share the Rhodes apartment with Joseph Ratana, a mate of Mr Ferguson's and a former organiser at the CFMEU. Also squashing into the unit is Tony "Papa" Papaconstantinos, another former CFMEU official.
When Fairfax Media called Mr Ratana to check his living arrangements he said: "I live there, that's all I'm concerned about."
His flatmate, Tony Papa claimed he had recently moved. Pressed as to whether he had ever lived at that address, Mr Papa snapped: "Where do you f---in' live? Get stuffed, will ya."
Mr Yu did not return calls.
Another disputed inclusion on the Concord branch's voting register is Anibal Arrarte, an invalid pensioner who lives in a housing commission block in Victoria Street, Burwood, an address outside the Canada Bay electorate.
A neighbour confirmed she had seen Mr Arrarte at the Victoria Street apartment block only a short time before Fairfax Media arrived.
However, the ALP membership list reflects that Mr Arrarte has taken up residence at a brand new apartment in Breakfast Point, inside the Canada Bay electorate. It transpires this apartment is owned by Mr Ferguson, who finalised the $1.3 million purchase of the two-bedroom Village Drive unit in June.
For his part, Mr Ferguson said he had only recently been made aware of the number of errors in the list of those eligible to vote and he had notified head office before the ballot and they did not vote.
Among the mistakes, Mr Ferguson said, was the address of Mr Arrarte, who he suggested had been briefly staying at Mr Ferguson's new home while he recuperated from an illness. He said his son Pablo had forgotten to notify head office that he had moved to Rozelle.
Mr Ferguson acknowledged his other son, Camilo did vote. He works overseas and interstate and was not living at the address given, but had bought a property in the electorate, his father said.
"When fabrications are made it often looks bad, but there is a party process, there is a system of appeal, which I support and there will be a determination about people's right to vote," Mr Ferguson said.
Fairfax Media has also sighted two statutory declarations alleging Mr Ferguson had "walked" the books. This refers to the practise of getting people to sign attendance books for meetings they did not attend, so that they can qualify to vote in preselections. Mr Ferguson rejected ever having been involved in such a process.
Allegations of electoral irregularities are causing headaches for Labor's head office.
Former Labor senator Belinda Neil was expelled from the party recently after she was found to be "walking the books".
Also causing problems for head office is Canada Bay councillor Tony Fasanella, who secured fourth spot on the Labor's ticket on Wednesday night, a position which is likely to ensure his re-election.
In June, Mr Fasanella was .
