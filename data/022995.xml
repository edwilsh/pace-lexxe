  <title>Men charged 18 percent</title>
  <content>
A Melbourne cafe is charging men an 18 percent gender surcharge, sparking a fierce debate on social media.
Handsome Her, located in the northern suburb of Brunswick, is a vegan cafe that aims to raise awareness about the pay gap between men and women.
Outside the cafe, a chalkboard describes the outlet as a "place by women, for women", and lists three "house rules" diners are to abide by:
1.    Women have priority seating.
2.    Men will be charged an 18 percent premium to reflect the gender pay gap (2016) which is donated to a women's service.
3.    Respect goes both ways

Should men have to pay the gender surcharge?

Owner Alex O'Brien told Broadsheet she wanted to bring pay discrepancy to the "forefront of people's minds".

"We are not imposing the surcharge, it's voluntary," Ms O'Brien added.
The extra funds are then donated to a rotating roster of women's charities.
An image of the "house rules" shared to Twitter by user Paige Cardona last week has since been flooded with a broad range of opinions.
Some Twitter users argued the surcharge was "aggressive",  while others said they "loved" the idea.
"If you want to fight for equality then surely treating everyone the same is the way to go," social media user Leroy Brown wrote.
On the 9NEWS Chatroom this afternoon, Adelaide presenter Brenton Ragless said he would be "happy to pay".
"It's great for raising awareness about a big social issue in Australia," Ragless said.
"I do wonder though if I would feel comfortable in the cafe," he added.
9NEWS Perth anchor Emmy Kubainski said she would be "comfortable" taking her husband to the outlet.
The nation's pay gap between men and women's salaries was at 23.1 percent last year, according to research by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA).
