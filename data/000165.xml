ANI news: An ICG Ship apprehended Merchant Vessel carrying approximately 1500 kgs of heroine valued at about Rs3500 Cr off the coast of Gujarat.

Indian authorities have seized a massive 1,500 kilograms of heroin, estimated to be worth more than $550 million, from a merchant ship off the country's western coast.
India is part of a transit route in the lucrative drug-smuggling trade due to its proximity to Afghanistan, which is the world's largest producer of opium.
The ship, believed to be registered in Panama, was seized on Saturday.
Coast guard authorities said it was the biggest seizure of narcotics in recent years, the Press Trust of India reported.
The vessel had eight crew members onboard and was heading for the Alang shipyard in Gujarat state, the agency said.
The crew has been detained for questioning.
Details on where the consignment originated and people involved in the smuggling were not immediately known.
A joint investigation by the Indian coast guard, intelligence agencies, police and the Navy is underway.
