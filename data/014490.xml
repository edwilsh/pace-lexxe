  <title>Professional boxer Lauryn Eagle charged with drug driving</title>
  <content>
Australian professional boxer and model Lauryn Eagle has been charged after allegedly returning a positive result for methamphetamine at a roadside drug test in Sydney.
The 29-year-old was charged on Wednesday with driving with an illicit drug in her system and is due to appear in Sutherland Local Court on September 26.
Eagle told The Today Show on July 14 she was "heartbroken" for her and her family by the allegation she'd taken illicit drugs.
She blamed the positive result - recorded in Peakhurst in mid-July - on prescription medications for narcolepsy and ADHD.
More to come.
