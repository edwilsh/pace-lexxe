The clothes and equipment belonging to a missing 32-year-old man last seen on the Canning Stock Route in WA's Pilbara have been found, as a massive search in the remote stretch of the state enters its third day.
Anthony Collis was travelling with a woman to Darwin on Thursday when they became separated, roughly 570 kilometres inland south-east of Broome, near the Karlamilyi National Park.
The woman, disoriented and dehydrated, later walked into the Georgia Bore Camp on the Canning Stock Route, 8.2 kilometres north of Well 22.
The pair's vehicle was found abandoned on Friday, one kilometre north of the well.
The search so far has involved local officers, tactical response group trackers, the police airwing and State Emergency Services volunteers
Mr Collis is 185 centimetres tall, with a medium build, blonde hair and blue eyes.
Police are asking anyone who may have spotted him to contact them immediately on 131 444.
