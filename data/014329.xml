  <title>Blues hopeful McKay will make it back</title>
  <content>
Harry McKay has kicked three goals in his first two senior games

CARLTON are hoping exciting tall forward Harry McKay's season isn't over after he was sidelined by a toe injury.

The 19-year-old will miss Saturday's clash with Essendon at the MCG after making his highly-anticipated debut a fortnight ago.

"We'll just have to see how that toe comes up ... hopefully it's a week or two, but that's the unknown," coach Brendon Bolton said on Friday.

More to come.
