Crews were called to the driving range at the prestigious Links Hope Island golf course about 8.10am on Tuesday.
Queensland Ambulance Service acting senior operations supervisor Bill Houghton said the woman suffered a deep cut to the back of her head and minor cuts and bruises to her back and hands.
"The crew reported on the scene that the kangaroo initially approached  a male who was on a driving range," he said.
"He tried to attack the male.
"The female went across to assist the gentleman that was being attacked and the kangaroo retaliated and attacked the female patient."
She was taken to the Gold Coast Private Hospital in a stable condition and released later in the day.
The man escaped injury.
