LABOR STALWARTS: Ryan Park, John Wark, Sharon Bird, Anna Watson, Fay Campbell, Paul Scully, Kay Heffernan, Stella Chapman and Joe Caruana.

Eight Illawarra Labor identities' service to their party has been recognised with Life Membership status.

Combined they have been Labor Party members for almost 350 years. They received their Life Membership award at the recent NSW Labor State Conference.
Fay Campbell has been a loyal Labor member and unionist for over 42 years.

Joseph Caruana has served as a link between Labor and the Illawarra Maltese community since joining the party in 1969.
Stella Chapman's affiliation with the red-side of politics started in 1976 and has included helping establish the party's Bay and Basin branch.

Kay Heffernan has helped promote the party's values to the local Catholic community for the best part of 40 years.
Ferdinando Lelli AM was awarded the Order for Australia for his advocacy for the rights of steel industry workers.
Colin Markham served as both State Member for Keira and Wollongong from 1988 to 2003. His wife Melissa Markham has also been very active since joining the party in 1975.
John Wark has served the Thirroul branch of the party for 42 years.
