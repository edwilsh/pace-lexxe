GOD'S OWN COUNTRY

There is an obvious comparison to be made here with Brokeback Mountain, but Francis Lee's story of two shepherds moving from rough sexual release to love has its own very different rhythms and colours, drawn directly from the Yorkshire moors where Lee grew up and has set his film.Photo: Agatha A. Nitecka
Josh O'Connor's​ Johnny is clearly condemned to a bleak life on his family's marginal sheep farm, stuck in morbid silence at home and unable to muster much to say outside it. He is wordlessly resentful when his father takes on a Romanian farmhand Gheorghe (Alec Secareanu​) to help with lambing.
As Johnny gradually gives way to feeling, it is as if the warmth of the animals, the roiling sky and the earth itself were working in concert with Gheorghe's beauty to break down his gruff resistance. All of nature, not least Johnny's own, is calling him.
