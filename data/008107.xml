  <title>Scorching Malcolm Turnbull quotes resurface as push for same-sex marriage postal plebiscite grows</title>
  <content>
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has fuelled speculation the government will bypass Parliament and commission a postal vote on same-sex marriage, refusing to rule it out on Wednesday as the idea builds momentum among colleagues.
But it has been revealed Mr Turnbull argued vociferously against a postal vote when he led the campaign for an Australian republic, saying such a method "flies in the face of Australian democratic values".

Government sticking to its plan

Despite calls for a conscience vote and some Liberal MPs threatening to cross the floor, the government isn't budging on its plan for a same sex marriage plebiscite.

The postal poll - which would be voluntary, non-binding and conducted by mail - would be used as a substitute for the failed plebiscite (a compulsory, nationwide vote), which failed to get through the Senate last year.
Unlike a plebiscite, the postal vote would not require legislation, and the government is understood to be seeking advice on its logistics and viability.

Despite once arguing a postal vote would unfairly disenfranchise millions of Australian voters, Mr Turnbull refused to rule out the proposal on Wednesday.
"I went to the election as leader of the Coalition and as Prime Minister promising ... there would be a free vote on same-sex marriage in the Parliament if the Australian people approved of it in a plebiscite," he said. "There as a conditional precedent, as the lawyers might say." 

Asked if a postal vote would fulfil that condition, Mr Turnbull said: "Thanks for the inquiry, our policy is very clear - I've stated it many times, and that is the government's policy."

Pressed again to rule out a postal vote, he said "thank you" and moved on to other questions.
Having once argued in the party room against a plebiscite, Mr Turnbull is now under pressure to adhere to the policy - even if it means a postal vote that proponents concede is "second best".
In 1997, as leader of the Australian Republican Movement, Mr Turnbull wrote an excoriating opinion piece against a postal vote on the republic, saying it would contravene basic democratic values.
It would disenfranchise more than a million voters who were not at their address listed on the electoral roll, he warned, particularly young people Aboriginal Australians in remote communities.
Mr Turnbull said a postal vote would also disenfranchise those who struggled with English. "They will throw it in the bin and their vote will be lost," he wrote in a 1997 article for The Australian, unearthed by Crikey on Wednesday.
Among Mr Turnbull's other concerns were voter fraud, peer pressure from family members and a high informal vote.
"The voluntary postal voting method ... flies in the face of Australian democratic values," he wrote. "It is likely to ensure that not only will a minority of Australians vote, but also that large sections of the community will be disfranchised."
But the Prime Minister's Coalition colleagues are increasingly embracing the postal vote idea to break the same-sex marriage impasse.
The idea was first spruiked by Immigration Minister Peter Dutton, who described it as "a much cleaner process than people running off to support private members' motions, or a Labor stunt within the House of Representatives".
The Queensland Liberal National Party resolved two weeks ago to support a postal vote plebiscite, and other ministers and MPs have joined in the call.
Assistant Immigration Minister Alex Hawke told Fairfax Media on Tuesday the postal vote was "another option for resolving this issue that fits the government's election commitment".
Former prime minister Tony Abbott last month acknowledged a voluntary postal vote would lack authority but said it was "much better than just trying to ram this thing though the Parliament".
