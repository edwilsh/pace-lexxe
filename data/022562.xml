  <content>
LONG considered one of Hollywood's most adorable couples, Chris Pratt and Anna Faris today announced their separation.
News of the shock split came via a joint announcement on Pratt's official Facebook page, in which the pair state that they "tried hard for a long time."
"Anna and I are sad to announce we are legally separating. We tried hard for a long time, and we're really disappointed. Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward. We still have love for each other, will always cherish our time together and continue to have the deepest respect for one another," says the announcement, signed "Chris Pratt and Anna Faris."
The pair met in 2007 on the set of the film Take Me Home Tonight, getting engaged a year later and marrying in Bali in July 2009. They have one son, Jack, born in 2012.
