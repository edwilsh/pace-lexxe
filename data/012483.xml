Investigators expect to spend at least two days at the scene of a light plane crash that left a trainee pilot and instructor seriously injured when the aircraft ditched into a paddock south-east of Melbourne.

An Ambulance Victoria spokeswoman could not confirm the gender or any other details about the person.
A man believed to be in his 20s was freed from the two-seater training plane and taken to The Alfred Hospital with facial, chest and spinal injuries in a serious but stable condition.
Recreational Aviation Australia will investigate the crash as the governing body for ultralight aircraft and pilots.
"We will have two investigators on scene this afternoon and all day tomorrow," said CEO Michael Linke said.
The area is regularly used by light planes, including pilots in training.
Four people died in two separate crashes in the same area little more than a year apart in February 2007 and May 2008.
