  <title>RBA holds interest rate at 1.5%</title>
  <content>
The Reserve Bank has held its benchmark interest rate at 1.50 per cent and indicated the Australian dollar's recent rise could slow economic growth.
RBA governor Philip Lowe said the recent appreciation of the Australian dollar partly reflects a lower US dollar, and added that a rising exchange rate would be expected to result in a slower pick up in economic activity and inflation than currently forecast.
The Australian dollar rose in the minutes following the RBA's 1430 AEST announcement, to 80.35 US cents.
