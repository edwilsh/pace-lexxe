  <title>Underpayment, vermin, poor hygiene: Inside Canberra nail salons</title>
  <content>
At least a quarter of Canberra nail salons have been investigated in the past two years and several hit with health and safety sanctions linked to vermin infestations, unsafe chemical practices, poor infection control and cleanliness.
Advocacy groups have also questioned the working conditions of Canberra nail salon employees, with one migrant women's network describing long hours, underpayment and an expectation that employees perform household jobs for bosses such as cooking and taking children to school.Photo: Rohan Thomson
An appetite for fast and cheap beauty treatments has seen a 13-fold increase in the number of nail salons in Canberra in almost as many years. Just three were registered with ACT Health in 2005; by last month, there were 39.
ACT government departments issued about 10 improvement notices to at least nine Gungahlin and Belconnen salons following 18 investigations, six of which were triggered after a customer raised concerns about staff exposure to fumes.
An Access Canberra spokeswoman said WorkSafe ACT's improvement notices were linked with health and safety legislation, including that used to regulate chemicals.
The chemicals used in nail salons may be flammable, corrosive and toxic. Repeated exposure to the strong glues used to attach fake nails has been linked with eye, skin and upper respiratory tract infections.

"Areas of compliance issues or improvements included electrical equipment testing and tagging needed on all equipment, ensuring all chemicals had a current safety data sheet located with them, ensuring documentation displayed was in [an] appropriate language ... and cleaning needing to occur," the Access Canberra spokeswoman said.
Asian Women at Work coordinator Lina Cabaero detailed the plight of some migrant nail salon employees in Australia. The advocacy group has spoken with women working 12-hour shifts or seven-day stretches, often asked to perform jobs outside their role.

Some women she knew were expected to pay for further training - "a scam", Ms Cabaero said - and were paid cash in hand, about $10 an hour.
"When they come here they need to work immediately, so most of the low-paid industries are where they end up in," she said.
"People are not aware of their rights, there's underpayment under award rates, and the working conditions.
"Something has to be done for those industries where a lot of migrant women work."
Ms Cabaero also raised concerns about prolonged exposure to chemicals. She questioned chemical safety induction processes and noted much of the training was done on the job.
"Even for the person having the nails done it is very dangerous," Ms Cabaero said.
Beauty industry veteran and Elleebana principal Christine McGibbon said someone was losing out when it came to cheap treatments, questioning the safety of the chemicals used, the training of staff and the risk of infection. 
Ms McGibbon said: "I don't know how they can pay their staff the award wage and charge what they charge."
Just last month the Fair Work Ombudsman commenced legal action against the operator of an Adelaide nail salon, alleging two young migrant workers were underpaid more than $50,000 and that false records were provided to the ombudsman.
Fair Work inspectors are now partway through an audit of about 1600 New South Wales, Queensland and Victorian beauty businesses but will not visit the ACT.
ACT Health has noted the rapid increase in Canberra nail salons and last year translated its public health messaging into Vietnamese to better support migrant workers. That directorate's improvement notices were related to inadequate cleaning practices and vermin control.
The Freedom Partnership national policy and advocacy coordinator Heather Moore said the anti-slavery project heard anecdotal evidence of issues within nail salons.
"In situations like these it would be helpful to have more broad-based public campaigns so victims who have no contact with people outside the industry can get help," she said.
Ms Cabaero said the rights of women working in the beauty industry had to be addressed.
"Really, the women who are using the service of those women in the nail and beauty industry have to really be aware about their conditions and there has to be an awareness campaign on this kind of work that is happening," she said.
"It is very normal for us to walk into a nail and beauty shop and have our nails done and say 'thank you very much' but we don't know what's happening."
