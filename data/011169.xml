MICHAEL Bisping says his on-again, off again fight against returning legend Georges St-Pierre is now official for UFC 217 at Madison Square Garden in November.
Bisping, the reigning middleweight champion, will put his 185-pound belt on the line against long-time welterweight king GSP in New York City on November 4 (November 5 AEST).
Bisping made the declaration on UFC Tonight on FOX Sports in the US. The UFC itself has yet to confirm the date, though president Dana White has flagged the revival of the match-up.

UFC: Georges St-Pierre and Michael Bisping have agreed to fight each other in the near future.

The English veteran was meant to face Australia's interim MW champion Robert Whittaker to unify the belts, but 'The Reaper' suffered a knee injury in his win over Yoel Romero that will keep him inactive until next year.
White, who resurrected Bisping-GSP on the weekend at UFC 214, said that Whittaker would face the winner of the new match-up.
It could make the title unification bout even bigger for the Aussie, with GSP a true MMA icon. White has also said he is very interested in bringing a Whittaker title fight to Australia, a voracious fight market that would deliver a huge crowd.

Yet Bisping will intend to keep the strap, which he has defended just once so far, against veteran rival Dan Henderson at UFC 204 last October.
"This is actually the third time I've been offered this fight," Bisping said.
"So the ship's sailed twice. On this occasion, on the third occasion, it did a U-turn and it pulled up at New York City, and I've got a chirpy little Englishman who is going to fight Georges St-Pierre, Madison Square Garden, November 4th.

"It is official, put it in your diary, do not miss it. We're taking over. Boom."

St Pierre, 36, will not have fought in almost exactly four years by the supposed date of the fight. The Canadian is still younger than Bisping (38) but will presumably carry ring rust into the bout, which comes well after his controversial final title defence against Johny Hendricks - a match many believed he lost.
GSP's record reads 25-2-0, with no losses since his earth-shattering KO defeat against Matt Serra at UFC 69 in April 2007. Bisping's record is 30-7-0, with his last loss a submission against Luke Rockhold during November 2014 - which he avenged in astonishing fashion in June 2016, by knocking out Rockhold in Round 1 to claim the title as a late injury substitute.
Rockhold is also back in action soon, taking a fight against David Branch as the main event of a UFC Fight Night card in Pittsburgh on September 16 (September 17 AEST). The American (15-3-0) has not fought since losing to Bisping and is gunning for a shot at regaining his title.
