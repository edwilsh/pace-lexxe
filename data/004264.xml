  <title>Scientists in race to stop caterpillars developing into hybrid super pests</title>
  <content>
Australian-led research could help save the world's farmers more than $6 billion lost every year to its most voracious caterpillars.

Key points

Cotton bollworms and corn earworms feed on more than 200 types of crops.
They have many more genes for tasting, digesting and detoxifying than other caterpillars
There are fears they could hybridise to create a new super pest.

The cotton bollworm and the corn earworm - Helicoverpa armigera and Helicoverpa zea, respectively - are humanity's greatest competitors for food and fibre, according to CSIRO scientist John Oakeshott.
Researchers fear that the two species could combine to create a new super pest.
Dr Oakeshott and CSIRO colleague Karl Gordon worked with a team of international researchers for eight years, mapping the entire genome of the pests.
Their research has just been published in the online journal BMC Biology.
The caterpillars feed on more than 200 types of crops including cotton, tomato, corn, soybeans and chickpeas, costing farmers in Australia, Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas billions of dollars in lost crops and control measures.
"The bollworm in particular is truly a very, very, hungry caterpillar," Dr Gordon said.

The scientists discovered that the bollworm and earworm have many more genes for tasting, digesting and detoxifying than other caterpillars, and that the bollworm, which is dominant in Australia, is a genetic warhorse.
"Its genetic arsenal has allowed it to outgun all our known insecticides through the development of resistance, reflecting its name - armigera - which means armed and warlike," Dr Oakeshott said.
He said the two caterpillars were so genetically similar there is a real danger the two could hybridise to create a new super pest.
In Brazil, the bollworm is gaining ground on the earworm and hybrids have already been identified, sparking fears that a new "improved" super pest could spread into the United States.
"I have enormous respect for this caterpillar," Dr Gordon said.
Resistance to toxins

In the mid-1990s, the CSIRO helped to develop a cotton plant which had a bacteria toxic to the bollworm.
That led to an 80 per cent reduction in the chemical pesticides used to control bollworms, the CSIRO said, but after 10 years, the bollworm built up resistance to the toxin.
"We need the full range of agricultural science [to combat this pest]," Dr Gordon said.
"Our recent analyses of the complete genome, its adaptations and spread over the years are a huge step forward in combating these megapests."
"It makes it easier to identify genes that are resistant to new chemicals and map the spread of those genes" and any mutations," Dr Oakeshott said.
The researchers identified more than 17,000 protein coding genes in the genomes of the bollworm and earworm.
The CSIRO worked in conjunction with the University of Melbourne, the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, the French National Institute for Agricultural Research, the Max Plank Institute of Chemical Ecology in Germany and the United States Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service.
