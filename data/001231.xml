  <title>Community service for woman's vile bus rant</title>
  <content>
A FOUL-MOUTHED woman who racially vilified a mother and child on an Adelaide bus has been ordered to perform 200 hours of community service for her "reprehensible" conduct.
On Monday, the Adelaide Magistrates Court told Stacey Marie Thomason her vulgar language and racist actions could and would not be condoned in a civilised society, despite her own difficult life.
The court said enduring domestic violence and losing her children as a result of drug and alcohol issues in no way excused Thomason's verbal attack upon a woman, of Asian descent, who did nothing more than board a bus with her child, 7.
The court said it would have imposed the maximum $1250 fine had Thomason not been unemployed and without means - and so ordered she perform her community service within just 12 months.
Thomason was charged with offensive language  on an Adelaide Metro bus at Fullarton on November 19 last year.
"Excuse me, you talk about disrespectful, excuse me, they're not f***ing people, they're not f***ing Australian, and she didn't pay for her f***ing ticket," she was recorded shouting.
"Literally, they're f***ing invading our country, can't you see it - f***ing Chinese people (are) f***ing everywhere.
"Wake up man, close your f***ing eyes eh. F***ing we're getting f***ing invaded by these f***ing c****."
Witnesses told her she was "a disgrace" and said "that's enough". She was later reported by the police Public Transport Safety Branch.
