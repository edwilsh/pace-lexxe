"Left the scene but still shaking. Hope everyone is okay. That was traumatising," she posted on Wednesday.
A pre-school aged child was taken to the Royal Children's Hospital in a stable condition.
Two people were taken to the Royal Melbourne Hospital and a third was taken to the Alfred Hospital, all three adults are in a stable condition.
