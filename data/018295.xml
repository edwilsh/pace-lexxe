  <title>AL GORE CONFIRMS: GLOBAL WARMING IS "SPIRITUAL ISSUE"</title>
  <content>
I've warned that global warming is a religion, with little to do with reason.  
Now warming preacher Al Gore confirms it:
youtube

Father John Rausch: As a priest living in central Appalachia, I've come to - I've come to realise that the climate crisis, I believe, is a crisis in spirituality.
Al Gore: The way we live our lives is definitely connected to this. It is - it's not a political issue. It is a moral and spiritual issue and thank you for bringing that up.
This explains so much: the hatred of sceptics; the persecution of sceptics as heretics; the resistance to reason; the end-of-days apocalyptic rhetoric; the demand for purely symbolic sacrifices; the disdain for evidence showing little warming and no added catastrophes.
