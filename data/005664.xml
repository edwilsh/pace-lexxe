  <title>Pub hosts underage private school party</title>
  <content>
A POPULAR Adelaide pub is facing tens of thousands of dollars in fines after hundreds of underage students from a prominent school descended on the bar for an after-party.
The Producers bar hosted about 400 teenagers on Saturday at what the students said was an 18th birthday party but was actually the Pembroke formal after-party.
Pub management shut the party down once they realised the age of the patrons.
Pembroke principal Luke Thompson said he was disappointed by the after-party but distanced the prestigious private school from the actions of its students.
"The school has very clear policies and guidelines for all members of the school community regarding parties ... we do not condone underage alcohol consumption," Mr Thompson said.
"Such events are organised independently of the school and we actively and strongly discourage after parties."
