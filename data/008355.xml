  <content>
A bride in the US has spent her wedding night behind bars after pulling a concealed gun from her wedding dress and pointing it at her husband's head.
Kate Elizabeth Prichard, 25, and her groom were reportedly seen drinking and arguing just hours after tying the knot outside the Clarion Inn in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, US news station .
Of the incident, Murfreesboro Police Sergeant Kyle Evans told WTVF: "She pulled out of her wedding dress a 9mm pistol. Pointed it at her new husband's head and pulled the trigger."
After realising the weapon was not loaded, Prichard loaded a round before reportedly firing into the air.
"Responding officers let the husband know the honeymoon was over and his new wife was going to jail," Evans said.
Prichard, who was still in her wedding dress, was taken into custody and charged with aggravated domestic assault before heading to Rutherford County jail. She was later released on $18,000 bond.
