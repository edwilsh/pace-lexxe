  <title>[SPOILERS] Here's everyone who has died this season on 'Game of Thrones' (so far)</title>
  <content>
Warning: Spoilers for "Game of Thrones" season seven. If you aren't caught up with the series, read at your own risk.
Season seven of "Game of Thrones" is only three episodes in, but it has already proven to be one of the most brutal yet. There's already been some major battles and major deaths, including one that made dying look cool.

For now, most of the dead folks on this list died at the hands of Cersei or Euron, but we're hoping that things start getting worse for them very soon.

So here is your guide to who died on "Game of Thrones" so far this season:

Time of death: Episode two, 'Stormborn.'

Cause of death: In his attack on Yara's fleet, Euron Greyjoy stabs the daughter of Oberyn Martell in the gut with a spear. By the end of the battle, her body is hanging from the ship, so she's definitely dead.

HBO

Time of death: Episode two, 'Stormborn.'

Cause of death: In Euron's attack, he strangles Nymeria, who is a daughter of Oberyn (and not Arya Stark's direwolf). At the end of the battle, her body is hanging from the ship, so she's also definitely dead.

HBO

Time of death: Episode three, 'The Queen's Justice.'

Cause of death: Cersei locks Ellaria up in a dungeon with her daughter, Tyene, who she poisons the same way Ellaria poisoned Myrcella: with a kiss and a poison called 'The Long Farewell.' So Ellaria has to watch her own daughter die a brutal death, and there's nothing she can do about it.

HBO

Time of death: Episode three, 'The Queen's Justice.'

Cause of death: Cersei wants to give Olenna a cruel death in King's Landing, but Jaime convinces her otherwise, and he gives Olenna poison. But Olenna goes down memorably. Right after she drinks the poison, she confesses to Jaime that she was the one who poisoned Joffrey, and she wants Cersei to know it.

HBO

Time of death: Unknown.

Cause of death: While we don't see Ellaria die on screen, actress Indira Varma confirmed to Entertainment Weekly that this was her last appearance on the show. She'll have a slow death rotting in the dungeons of the Red Keep, but fortunately we won't see it.
