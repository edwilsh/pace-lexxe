  <title>Cops want clues to why Glenroy mum shot</title>
  <content>
DETECTIVES are appealing for public help to solve the shooting of a Glenroy mum in the doorway of her home earlier this year.
Leonie Stuart, 52, was shot in the chest through the wire door of her Hubert Avenue home at about 11:50pm on 2 March this year.
Ms Stuart suffered life threatening injuries and spent more than two weeks in hospital.
It is believed a dark grey 4WD fled the scene and was last seen travelling south along Hubert Avenue towards Hilton Street.
Armed Crime Squad detectives are appealing for public assistance and are keen to speak to any witnesses or anyone that saw any suspicious activity in the area around that time.
Investigators did receive information from Crime Stoppers that a motorcycle was seen in the area at the time of the shooting and would like that caller to call back.
Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
