It was in response to information that Russia meddled in the US elections, however it has denied doing so.
Moscow responded to the sanctions by ordering a reduction in the number of US diplomats in Russia.
The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly before an official statement.
