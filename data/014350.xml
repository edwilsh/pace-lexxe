  <title>Sydney man guilty of neighbour's murder</title>
  <content>
A Sydney man who fatally stabbed his neighbour with a smashed beer bottle has been found guilty of murder.
Sateki Siale had admitted causing the death of Kelly Ventigadoo, but pleaded not guilty to murdering him early on October 11, 2015, at Lakemba in Sydney's south west.
However, a NSW Supreme Court jury on Friday found the 26-year-old was guilty of murder after less than three days of deliberations.
