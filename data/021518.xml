  <title>Australian Olympic gold girl Betty Cuthbert dies at 79</title>
  <content>
BETTY Cuthbert, the original Aussie Golden Girl and who took the 1956 Melbourne Olympics by storm as an 18-year-old, has died aged 79 after a long battle with multiple sclerosis.

Cuthbert was a four-time Olympic gold medallist, winning three at the 1956 Melbourne games in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay events.

She also won gold in the 400m eight years later at the Tokyo Olympics.

Cuthbert picked three Commonwealth Games medals including gold in the 4x100m relay in Perth in 1962.
