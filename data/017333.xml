  <title>US county tries to block R. Kelly gig</title>
  <content>
OFFICIALS in a US county want an upcoming concert by R. Kelly cancelled after a media report accusing the singer of holding women in a "sex cult".
The Board of Commissioners for Fulton County, Georgia, this week sent a letter asking Live Nation, the company contracted to book events at a county-owned venue outside Atlanta, to cancel Kelly's August 25 concert.
Messages seeking reaction to the letter from Live Nation weren't immediately returned on Friday afternoon.
A BuzzFeed News article published last month included  that Kelly forms relationships with young women then abuses them.
The families' claims that he is housing their daughters in Chicago and Atlanta, where he brainwashes them and "records" them in sexual encounters.
His ticket sales have suffered since the families came out to BuzzFeed with the allegations. Concert dates in Dallas, New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were cancelled due to low ticket sales - as fallout from the controversy.
An lawyer for Kelly told Buzzfeed that he denies the allegations.
The board's Chairman John Eaves said he doesn't plan any legal action but hopes Live Nation will cancel Kelly's concert.
