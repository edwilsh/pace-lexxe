  <title>King abdicates throne after long reign</title>
  <content>
FORMER star jockey Steven King has decided to call quits on his glittering riding career.
King burst into national prominence in the spring of 1991 with his association with the mare he said was the best horse he rode, Let's Elope.

They combined to win the Caulfield and Melbourne Cups and King also won the Victoria Derby on Star Of The Realm.
King hasn't ridden since November last year and said he had known for sometime he wasn't going to ride again.
King has been working for Lloyd Williams at Mt Macedon and said that was a wonderful opportunity for him.
"I'm still working out my career path, and whether that's as a trainer I'm not sure, but for the moment it's great to be with Lloyd Williams as he has great horses and great staff," King said.

"I'm happy with what I've achieved. I could have kept going for another three or four years but I'd really be milking it. I've gone down another career path which I regard it as a transition phase," King said.
"I'm happy doing what I'm doing and I just decided there was no value in going on. I'd only be devaluing my career."
47 year-old King said also the emergence of his son Lachlan as an apprentice had also influenced his decision.
"I hung around so I could have a couple of rides against him last year but then I thought he didn't need the added pressure of having me hanging around."
"It's time for me to step back and Lachlan to step up. I'm passing the baton to him."
King said Lachlan's riding career was to him a continuation of his own.

"I watch all of his rides and I'm like a coach behind the scenes for him. When he rides I feel as if I'm still riding," he said.
Lachlan King has ridden 45 winners and his father said he should be ready to ride in the city later in the year.
King had stints riding in Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai and the United Kingdom.
He won the 1996/1997 Melbourne Jockeys Premiership.
In the spring of 2002 King rode Helenus to win the Caulfield Guineas and the Victoria Derby and the following spring he also won the Cox Plate on Fields Of Omagh
The last Group 1 race King rode in was in Thousand Guineas last year when he finished second on I Am A Star.
