Two men have been charged with planning a terrorist act after police uncovered an alleged Sydney-based plot to bring down a plane.
Mahmoud Khayat, 32, from Punchbowl, and Khaled Mahmoud Khayat, 49, from Lakemba, have each been charged with two counts of acting in preparation for or planning a terrorist act, Australian Federal Police said in a statement on Thursday night.
Both men are scheduled to appear in Parramatta Court on Friday morning. The maximum penalty each could face is life imprisonment.
Khaled Merhi remains in custody, while a fourth man, 50, was released without charge on Tuesday night.
"The NSW Joint Counter Terrorism Team (JCTT) has charged two men in Sydney this evening with terrorism offences," the federal police statement said.
"One man remains in police custody under 'specified time' provisions outlined in Section 23DD of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). This legislation recognises that terrorism investigations are inherently complex and that there can be legitimate reasons for extended periods of detention for suspects in such matters.
"Police have conducted six premises searches across Sydney this week, including in the suburbs of Lakemba, Punchbowl (two locations), Surry Hills, Wiley Park and Bankstown.
"This investigation remains ongoing, and further information will be provided at a media conference tomorrow morning."
The statement urged members of the public to report "any suspicious activity" to the National Security Hotline on 1800 123 400.
