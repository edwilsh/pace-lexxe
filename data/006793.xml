PENELOPE Fernandez touched the face of the father she never met on what would be his 25th birthday, and the tears for Jose began to flow again.
About 11 months after Jose Fernandez was killed in a boating accident, his girlfriend, Maria Arias, and the daughter she was pregnant with returned to Marlins Park to commemorate his birthday with a team that is still wearing No. 16 patches on its sleeves.
Penelope took a tour of the clubhouse, where the five-month-old was the star.
"She is beautiful," infielder Miguel Rojas told the Miami Herald. "She has the same face as Jose. Even the hair. Kind of the messy hair like his when he came out of the showers. That's a little piece that we kind of need to remember him. This is a little piece of Jose in this world."

Fernandez's close friend, Dee Gordon, held her and showed her around the locker room, even as she cried. He showed her his uniform and cleats, still in the corner locker.
"I was hitting in the cage and Dee brought her in," Rojas said. "I wasn't expecting her at all. Right away, a lot of emotions. (Marcell) Ozuna was hitting in the other cage. We stopped what we were doing. It was really cool to see her and remember Jose."

The celebration of Fernandez's life has been marred by the details of his death. Investigators found that Fernandez had alcohol and cocaine in his system and was driving the boat the night of the fatal crash that killed him and two friends.
But Monday was about Fernandez's life. When the game started, another friend of Fernandez's, Washington's Gio Gonzalez, honoured him by no-hitting the Marlins for eight innings - until Gordon looped a single to left field.
After the hit, Gonzalez was pulled. The Florida native of Cuban descent walked off the mound to a standing ovation from a road crowd - that included Fernandez's mother and grandmother.
