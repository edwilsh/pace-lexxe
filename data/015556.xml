  <title>'Major winter storm' headed for SA</title>
  <content>
TORRENTIAL rain, blasting winds in excess of 100km/h and potential flooding in the Adelaide Hills - and we thought winter was on the way out.
Meteorologists are warning of a "serious winter storm" this weekend across Australia's south east with a trifecta of gales, showers and blizzards.
South Australia and Victoria will take the assault head on, with the ACT and NSW also affected, as a polar low moves north from the Southern Ocean towards western Bass Strait.
Chief Meteorologist Tom Saunders said the brunt of the bad-tempered weather is expected to arrive over the weekend.
"Both states can expect strong to gale force winds Saturday and Sunday with gusts over 90km/h widespread in exposed coastal and elevated regions," he said.
Adelaide and Melbourne are likely to see damaging gusts, especially late Saturday and early Sunday, when the stronger of two fronts sweeps overhead.
It has led to a flood watch warning for the Mount Lofty Ranges District.
Heavy rain is expected to lash the area from Friday afternoon - especially the upper Onkaparinga and upper Torrens Catchments, the Bureau of Meteorology said.
"Further rain is expected on these catchments from Saturday afternoon, continuing into Sunday, which may result in river and creek rises throughout the Mount Lofty Ranges."
"Localised minor flooding is possible from Saturday evening particularly from Oakbank to Verdun and may lead to some road closures."
The BoM predicts up to 30mm on Friday with a further 50 to 90mm possible this weekend.
Some of the heavier showers, mainly on Sunday, may also produce some hail and thunder.
After a dry start to winter, 50mm over four days in Mt Gambier would be its heaviest rain in five months.
If Adelaide receives forecast of 30mm it would be heaviest fall in the state's capital in three months.
