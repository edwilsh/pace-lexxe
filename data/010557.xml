About Mustang Resources Ltd
Listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, Mustang Resources Limited () ()  is an emerging gemstone developer and producer focused on the near-term development of the highly prospective Montepuez Ruby Project in northern Mozambique.

The Montepuez Ruby Project consists of four licences covering 19,500 hectares adjacent to the world's largest ruby deposit discovered by Gemfields PLC () in 2012. Since supply of rubies from sources outside Mozambique has become fractured and unreliable, Mustang stands to capitalise on the current demand around the world for ethically produced rubies by becoming a reliable, consistent supplier of high-quality rubies.

The Company is fast-tracking its work program on the Montepuez Ruby Project with high priority targets being identified and low-cost bulk sampling well underway. First rough ruby sales are scheduled for October 2017 under a closed bid tender of an estimated 200,000 cts gem quality rubies.
