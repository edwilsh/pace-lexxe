  <title>Tas fisherman caught with illegal scallops</title>
  <content>
A Tasmanian fisherman has allegedly been found with hundreds of illegally caught and undersize scallops.
The 38-year-old from Magra could be fined of thousands of dollars after being found with more than 780 commercial scallops, police say.
About 600 were under the 100mm size limit, with some as small as 79mm.
Recreational scallop season closed at the end of July and an on-land limit of 100 applies.
