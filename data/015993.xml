The fire - just after 4am on July 18, 2016 - significantly damaged the Kenny Street business and is being treated as suspicious. 
Five people were inside at the time of the blaze, but did not require medical treatment.

The man seen the images is wearing light-coloured pants, a black hooded jumper and white sneakers.
