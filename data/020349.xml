NOTHING sums up Round 20 quite like a sneaky ground invasion.
And what bigger a stage than during a crunch game, in front of a massive crowd at the MCG?
As the Tigers streamed through the middle of the hallowed turf time and time again, it appeared one spectator had been inspired to take on a dash of his own.
The shirtless man set off on a second-half dash across the ground, with security guards in hot pursuit.
Like so many before him, he was caught and tackled to the turf.
The man, who appeared to have the words "Get Rich or Die Tryin" tattooed on his chest, surely won't be too pleased to see the bill for his Sunday afternoon exploits.
Hope it was worth the almost $10,000 fine mate ðŸ˜‚
With a fine just short of $10,000 and a ban from the MCG the likely penalty, we can't imagine he'll be too keen to take on the venture again.
Richmond great Matthew Richardson raised perhaps the most poignant point of the whole encounter.
"If he's a Tiger fan, he might not get to go to the finals," Richardson said on 3AW.

"How dumb. It doesn't happen often!"
Catch some of the photos of the dramatic chase below.
