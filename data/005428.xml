  <title>Raceday focus: Sale</title>
  <content>
THE return to racing of KACHING (R7, No. 6), who promised to be a top-liner last spring, highlights the meeting at Sale on Wednesday.
The Ciaron Maher-trained son of So You Think finished third to Hey Doc in the Group 2 Stutt Stakes at Moonee Valley last September, and raced greenly throughout the race.
BIG CHANGES:
GOOD TRIAL:
Kaching then started $21 in the Caulfield Guineas but finished 12th. Maher then brought him back for three runs over summer and he disappointed on firm tracks.
He recently had a jump-out at Caulfield, where he wasn't pushed out.
Kaching opened at $3.70 with TAB and has firmed in to $3.40.
Robbie Laing is excited about the debut of his Redoute's Choice colt THE SWORD (R4, No. 8, $12), who cost $200,000 as a yearling. The youngster has pleased him in his trials.
Three jumps races will start the program.
BEST BET: KACHING (R7, No. 6, $3.40)
Showed a stack of potential last spring. He loves it soft and if he's close to his best he can resume with a win.
NEXT BEST: EVOLUTIONIST (R5, No. 3, $5.50)
Forget last start as it was a non event from wide barrier at Caulfield, and he also raced greenly. Stormed home at his debut for second at Bendigo before that.
VALUE BET: DAZZY'S DAY (R8, No. 12, $9.50)
Set a fast pace when led and weakened at Caulfield last start, but held on well for seventh behind Moonlite's Choice. Likes it wet and Damien Oliver will ride.
TRAINER TALK
ROBBIE LAING
THE SWORD (R4, No. 8, $12)
"He's got talent. He's had enough trials to be ready. Blinkers go on for his first start and he'll run well."
RITORNO (R5, No. 6, $21)
"He hasn't started since finishing fourth at Geelong last Christmas. He's well educated and he should be a place chance."
JUST FOR STARTERS (R6, No. 4, $18)
"On his way back from a long spell. He'll like it soft but he'll need the run."THE JOCKEY
Champion jockey DAMIEN OLIVER has always has had an affinity with Sale throughout his career, having ridden 31 winners from 131 rides at a strike rate of 23 per cent. Oliver has five rides, including the well-fancied MAGNETAR (R6, No. 9, $4.80), DANCE FOR ME (R7, No. 11, $3.70) and DAZZY'S DAY.
