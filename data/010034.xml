  <title>ICAC report set for release</title>
  <content>
The long-awaited report from a shocking NSW corruption inquiry that left several political careers dead in its wake is close to being released.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry into the Eddie Obeid-linked Australian Water Holdings concluded in 2014, with the report expected to be released on Thursday morning.
ICAC began looking into allegations that people connected with AWH, from both sides of politics, made corrupt financial gains by "adversely affecting the official functions" of the state-owned Sydney Water Corporation.
The then-federal assistant treasurer, Arthur Sinodinos, was the first scalp of the first inquiry.
The NSW senator stood aside from the front bench in March 2014 following questions over his time as chairman of AWH, but was reinstated 18 months later amid expectations he would be cleared.
Premier Barry O'Farrell was also forced to step down, dramatically resigning in April that year after admitting to misleading ICAC over a $3000 bottle of Grange Hermitage.
The report will be delivered to state parliament early on Thursday, before being publicly released, according to an ICAC spokeswoman.
