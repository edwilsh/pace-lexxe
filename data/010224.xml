  <title>Patient awarded $1 million after surgical 'nightmare' </title>

A woman who developed a severe infection associated with surgical mesh has been awarded $1 million, after a court found the doctors did not account for her personal risk factors.

The doctors who performed the hernia operation, in June 2010, placed surgical mesh over the dissection to promote healing and reinforce the area, which is standard procedure in that type of operation.
But Supreme Court Justice Stephen Campbell found they did not adequately account for a trifecta of risk factors - that she was a smoker, obese and the wound was very low in her abdomen - when they opted not to use a surgical drain following the surgery.Photo: iStockphoto
They then failed to detect that the wound was infected when she returned to the hospital on several later occasions.
Expert witness Trevor Currer, a surgeon, told the court the site of the surgical incision was "worst possible site for operating to avoid an infection".

"This case is a nightmare, if I may say, for a surgeon," Dr Currer said.

"This patient was waiting for an infection. This was on the cards right at the outset."
Mrs Tinnock returned to hospital six days after the initial operation when the wound began to ooze and bleed, and put out an offensive odour. 
Doctors admitted her to hospital and put her on a course of intravenous antibiotics, but a wound swab found no evidence of infection and she was discharged after five days without doctors taking a deeper swab, or washing out or removing the surgical mesh.
She reappeared again nine days later, to be put on another course of antibiotics, and a week after that.
By this time the Tinnock family was furious, and Mrs Tinnock's mother rang the emergency department to complain "volubly", Justice Campbell said.
But her treating surgeon Michael Payne again dismissed the notion that her symptoms indicated an infection and by this time it was clear the doctor-patient relationship had broken down. "This may have affected his perception."
As late as 24 hours before she was admitted to Calvary Hospital with a serious infection, Dr Payne put Mrs Tinnock's clinical signs down to her smoking and obesity.
But by this time it was already too late. Mrs Tinnock needed five additional surgical procedures over the following months to clean the wound, remove the mesh, change the dressings and revise the scar.
She claimed to have ongoing pain and discomfort, psychological injury, restricted capacity to perform daily activities and reduced earning capacity. She separated from her husband shortly afterwards and was caring for three children under five years of age.
Justice Campbell found Dr Payne's standard of care fell short, first in not using a drain at the time of the first surgery and, second, by failing to detect an obvious infection and treat it by removing the mesh and washing it or taking it out altogether.
Three of the five surgeons who gave expert evidence said a suction drain should have been used to control bleeding and reduce the risk of infection, given Mrs Tinnock's particular circumstances and the largeness of the surgical mesh, and all of them would have used one if she had been their patient.
Justice Campbell said it was clear a surgical drain should have been used in a case as complex as Mrs Tinnock's and the risk of harm that materialised when a drain was not used was "both foreseeable and not insignificant".
He ruled that the Murrumbidgee Local Health District was liable for damages and ordered it to pay $1,005,509 plus legal costs.
Just 10 per cent of medical negligence claims cost more than $500,000 in 2011-12, according to the latest figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.
Mrs Tinnock's damages included $230,000 for non-economic loss, $40,000 for past and future out-of-pocket expenses, $224,000 for past economic loss, $257,000 for future economic loss, $66,000 for past domestic assistance and $93,000 for future attendant care.
