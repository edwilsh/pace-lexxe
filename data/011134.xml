  <title>Commuter panic as Melbourne train catches fire</title>
  <content>
PEAK hour passengers have been forced to evacuate a train that burst into flames just outside Melbourne's Flinders St station on Thursday morning.
Commuters reportedly rushed to the back of the Metro train that caught fire when its power line connectors exploded. The top of the first carriage caught fire, with passengers having to move to the third carriage to escape the blaze.
The train was stopped between Batman Ave and Flinders Street Station, on the Sandringham line, with the fire at this stage contained to the roof.
A Metro Trains spokeswoman said there had been an "issue" on a train between Richmond and Flinders Street, and the fire brigade has been called. Metro has announced major delays to the Sandringham line.
