  <title>Ben Hunt to replace Andrew McCullough as Brisbane Broncos hooker</title>
  <content>
Ben Hunt is set to start at hooker for the first time since 2010 as Brisbane continue their run to the NRL finals without the injured Andrew McCullough.
Halfback Hunt trained at dummy-half on Monday after McCullough was ruled out for the season with an anterior cruciate ligament injury suffered in Friday's loss to Parramatta.

Eels impress in win over Broncos

The Eels show off their finals credentials with a superb win over the Broncos.

Utility Kodi Nikorima is expected to take over at halfback.
McCullough's are big shoes to fill, having excelled for the fourth-placed Broncos this year.

He has set up five tries while sitting in second place in the league for average tackles with 44.8.
Forward Korbin Sims doubted the 27-year-old Hunt could replicate McCullough's defensive output, but he backed his tactical acumen in the role.

"Ben's a good player, a very smart player, a smart halfback. So moving into the hooking role shouldn't be worry because he knows all the plays," Sims told reporters on Monday.
"I'm expecting him to be pretty crafty around the ball. The more he can have a hands-on role like Andrew McCullough does, it'll be beneficial for the team.Photo: Darren England
"If he (Hunt) picks a spot where he wants to run or where he wants to pass, I'll back him 100 per cent."
Hunt, who made his State of Origin debut for Queensland off the bench in this month's third game, will join St George Illawarra at the end of the season on a five-year deal believed to be worth millions.
Meanwhile, five-eighth Anthony Milford said winger Corey Oates was close to making his return from a staph infection after missing the past four matches.
"He's done everything he needed to do and just needs to get the all-clear and train all week," Milford said.
The Broncos play the Gold Coast at Cbus Super Stadium on Saturday.
