The NRL has hit Paul McGregor with a breach notice, informing the St George Illawarra Dragons coach of a proposed $10,000 fine for his attack on match officials last weekend.
McGregor described the referees as "embarrassing and incompetent" following his side's shock 21-14 loss to wooden spoon favourites Newcastle on Saturday.

Knights end eight game losing streak

Nathan Brown's men have finally claimed another win with a stirring win over the Dragons in Newcastle.

The NRL has responded  with a proposed $10,000 fine, providing the Dragons with an opportunity to lodge a submission if they believe the punishment doesn't reflect the crime.
McGregor landed himself in hot water when he replied to a question regarding a couple of contentious decisions in the match against the Knights in Newcastle.

"Definitely. I think anyone that knows rugby league would agree," he said.
"The ball went back on the Nightingale one, which should've been overruled and it wasn't, and the bloke [Trent Hodkinson] took a dive, he wouldn't have got to Nene [MacDonald]."Photo: Adam McLean
"When you spend millions of dollars [on the bunker] it is [disappointing]."
