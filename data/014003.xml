Three fire crews were working to control the blaze that was billowing "large volumes of black smoke".
Police have asked nearby businesses to evacuate.
Police have closed the southbound lanes, with traffic being diverted off at the Bryant Road exit.
Police said the northbound lanes along the motorway may also close and have urged motorists to avoid the area.
