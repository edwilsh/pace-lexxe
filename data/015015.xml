  <title>Fawkner's Cousin Ali in wrestling face-off</title>
  <content>
A LOCAL favourite is in big trouble if his opponent is to be believed when pro wrestling comes to Fawkner.
Fawkner raised hero Ali Kerbatieh, aka Cousin Ali, will face off against Johnathan Flentjar, otherwise known as Johnathan Preston in the main event of the Inception show.
"(Kerbatieh) is younger than me and about three or four inches taller than me, but he has the weight of the world on his shoulders because he will be going in front of his hometown," Flentjar said.
"They're going to be cheering for him so any chance I can get some kind of move and a counter on him I will because the more they hate me and boo me the less cheers Ali will get."
Run by Premier Pro Wrestling, the event will also feature a collection of other bouts.
"It's a can't miss show, it will be the first crowning of a Premier Wrestling World Champion, you will want to tell your family you were there," Flentjar said.
at the Fawkner Community Hall.
