The veteran promoter - who brought The Rolling Stones, ABBA and U2 to our shores - has found his office "besieged" with phone calls. Everyone wants the same thing: to see Jerry Seinfeld perform live. "People are begging," Dainty says. "They're offering anything and everything."
Whenever he announces a concert, new "friends" appear. "Normally, I've got a couple of spare tickets in my back pocket for an emergency. Except my back pocket is empty. 

"We knew Seinfeld Live was going to be hot. But even we were taken aback with the speed and fanaticism with which people tried to get tickets."
I begin by asking Dainty how quickly the first batch of shows sold out. "About as long as we've been speaking," he replies. New dates were announced - and those were snapped up just as quickly. (As of Friday morning, it appears some tickets may be available .) 

To satisfy demand, Seinfeld will perform every day he's in Australia. All up, around 140,000 of us will see him in the flesh. 
Considered one of the world's great stand-ups, he started in comedy more than 40 years ago - but became internationally famous with the success of his sitcom. In 1998, its final episode averaged 76 million viewers across the US.Comedians in Cars Getting CoffeePhoto: Supplied
Seinfeld was offered more than US$100 million for another season, but he declined. Instead, he visited Australia, playing in Sydney and Melbourne. Dainty promoted those shows, too. "I think we spent 50 cents on advertising, which was the cost of a phone call to let everyone know. He sold out straight away."
Since then,  have emerged. Local Seinfeld fans were dismayed to miss out through official vendor Ticketek - only to see their desired tickets at .
"It's a global issue," Dainty says, urging the Australian government to reign in the practice. "People spend all this money, then they're not allowed in because they bought the tickets from an unauthorised re-seller."
This is especially frustrating, given the enormous appetite for Seinfeld Live.
"Part of it is his legendary status. But he's remained incredibly current - just look at his [web series] Comedians In Cards Getting Coffee. He's remained incredibly current and he's such a smart guy; a creative genius.
"If we could get Jerry to do another lap of Australia, he'd sell out again."
Jerry Seinfeld performs at Perth Arena on August 4, Adelaide Entertainment Centre on August 5, Melbourne's Hisense Arena from August 6-8, Brisbane Entertainment Centre on August 9, Sydney's Qudos Bank Arena on August 10 and ICC Sydney Theatre on August 11.
