  <title>Home prices show huge divergence in two-tier property market</title>
  <content>
Australia's three mainland south-eastern capitals continued to drive national property price gains, as the other cities lag further behind.
Melbourne is now clearly the hottest real estate market, with prices jumping 3.1 in July, 4.1 per cent over the quarter and nearly 16 per cent in the past year.
Sydney's price growth lagged over all those periods, and it has now been overtaken by Canberra on the list of fastest growing property prices.
Those three cities were the only ones with double-digit annual price rises, as Hobart's previously stronger growth slowed down.
Elsewhere in the county, prices were essentially flat or slightly falling.
Perth and Darwin prices both went backwards 2.1 per cent over the past year.
Brisbane and Adelaide both had property price rises only just ahead of consumer price inflation.
More to come.
