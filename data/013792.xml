  <content>
Hand out: Dementia.

MORE than $3.2 million has been awarded to the University of Newcastle (UON) to improve the wellbeing and outcomes for people living with dementia.
Laureate professor Robert Sanson-Fisher was awarded more than $1.2 million to implement a web-based program for people living with dementia in rural areas. Dr Jamie Bryant was granted a similar amount to improve diagnosis and care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients; and about $700,000 went to Dr Mariko Carey to address gaps in care research.
