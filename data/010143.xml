NO PUSSY-FOOTING: Jones The Cat launch their new single Bitter Prick on Friday, which was recorded by Luca Brasi producer Jimmy Balderston.

TWO years ago judges for the University of Newcastle's battle of the bands told Jones The Cat that wearing shorts on stage was "unprofessional" and had cost them victory.
Not ones willing to quietly conform, the Maitland punk band turned up the following year again in shorts and emerged victorious, before winning the NSW final and competing at the national university battle of the bands.

"We thought these are the arseholes who said we shouldn't be wearing shorts, so let's wear shorts again," Jones The Cat frontman Jack Waterson said.

That bloody-mindedness shown in the university competition was produced in the making of Jones The Cat's forthcoming second EP Shorts.

Jones The Cat - Bitter Prick
After hearing Tasmanian punk band Luca Brasi's album If This Is All We're Going To Be, Waterson and his bandmates Cameron Macey (guitar), Jarrod Wilton (bass) and Tristan Lacey (drums) sought out the record's producer Jimmy Balderston.

Jones The Cat then travelled to Balderston's hometown of Adelaide and pumped out the seven-track EP, which is due for release in October. The first single Bitter Prick dropped online last month.
"After the last EP we thought we really want to nail this, so no expense spared," Waterson said. "We'll find whatever sound we like and go to the sound. It didn't take much convincing really."

Jones The Cat launch Bitter Prick at the Lass O'Gowrie on Friday. 
EMPIRE ROAMS

BEFORE attempting to tour the colossal expanse of the US, gaining knowledge from some of the music industry's shrewdest minds could be considered invaluable.

Newcastle hard rock three-piece Stone Empire will have that opportunity after frontman and manager Justin Dorin was awarded an Association of Artist Managers mentorship.

Through the one-year program Dorin will receive advice on managing a rock band from AAM director Tim Price, INXS engineer David Nicholas and Angels and GANGgajang drummer Graham Bidstrup.
Nicholas will also release Stone Empire's debut album State Of Control through his Rhinoceros Records label. The record is still in production at Glendale's Spinlight Studio with Rhys Zacher, but the first two singles Rome Burns and State Of Control have already been released online.

Dorin said Stone Empire's debut will be released in October to coincide the band's first American tour. You can catch Stone Empire on August 18 when they support Beast Machine at the Hamilton Station Hotel.
PRESET THAT

PARTY: Alison Wonderland is one of the headline acts for This That.
THIS That might be losing its view by moving from Newcastle Foreshore to Wickham Park, but the festival's quality appears to have risen.
The first line-up announcement was dropped on Tuesday and was headlined by 2000s electronic dance music innovators The Presets, indie rock favourites The Preatures, multi-instrumentalist sensation Tash Sultana, hip-hop posse The Thundamentals, EDM golden girl Alison Wonderland and Canadian duo Zeds Dead.
The bill also include's Carmada, Colour Castle, Crooked Colours, Elk Road, Godlands, Golden Vessel, Hucci, Kinder, Kuren, Luude, Motez, Muto, Paces, Poolclvb, Tigerilla, Winston Surfshirt and a Triple J Unearthed winner.
Due to construction at Newcastle Foreshore for the Supercars, This That has been shifted to Wickham Park. 
This That members can buy tickets from 9am Thursday and general sale begins 9am next Monday. 
IN THE MILLIONS

ON Saturday the Herald brought you the story about Newcastle indie band Vacations and their surprise popularity overseas after several of their songs were added to music streaming playlists by curators.

Well, on Sunday the No-Fi Records band reached one million plays on Spotify. 
RAAVE AT THE FORT

THE historic and picturesque Fort Scratchley famously came under Japanese fire in 1942, but the Newcastle landmark is preparing for a different kind of invasion on Saturday.
Newcastle dance-punk three-piece Raave Tapes will launch their latest single k bye at the Fort Scatchley barracks from 5pm. Newcastle producer Taki Local will provide support.
BRIT TOUR

LAST October British India's Declan Melia told the Herald his band kicked off their single tour for I Thought We Knew Each Other at the Cambridge Hotel because it was one their favourite venues.
No surprises British India are returning to the Newcastle West venue on November 17 for their upcoming album tour. The Melbourne four-piece's sixth album Forgetting The Future is released on September 22 and surprisingly doesn't include I Thought We Knew Each Other.
The album was produced by Holy Holy's Oscar Dawson, who was also busy manning the production desk for Alex Lahey's debut LP I Love You Like A Brother, due out October 6.
