  <title>Suspended jockey to fight for Darwin Cup ride</title>
  <content>
LEADING Darwin jockey Brendon Davis will fight his one meeting suspension in a last ditch attempt to ride NT Derby winner Billet Doux in the $200,000 Carlton Mid Darwin Cup (2000m) at Fannie Bay on Monday.
Davis, fresh from winning the Top End jockeys' premiership for a fourth straight year, was suspended and incurred a $500 fine for careless riding after piloting the Gary Clarke-trained Marbel Duke to victory on Wednesday.
Davis missed last Saturday's meeting for careless riding after winning on board Marbel Duke on July 22.
He lodged his appeal on Friday morning.
Thoroughbred Racing Northern Territory chairman of stewards David Hensler confirmed that the appeal will take place at 3pm Friday at Fannie Bay.
Davis, who will ride Clarke's Ticket To Toorak in the $135,000 Palmerston Sprint (1200m) on Saturday, will most likely forfeit his Cup ride to veteran Darwin rider Stephen Ridler should his appeal prove unsuccessful.
Meanwhile, Clarke's King Pardon, one of four horses from his stable that was entered in the Palmerston Sprint, has been scratched from the feature race on Day 7 of the Darwin Cup Carnival.
It was believed that King's Pardon was suffering from injury when all of the Palmerston Sprint runners were vetted on Thursday.
King's Pardon was vetted again first thing Friday morning and hadn't improved.
He was found to be lame in the near hind leg.
Clarke concurred with vets and King's Pardon will not take his place in the race.
Clarke won the Palmerston Sprint last year with Handsome Tycoon.
A field of 11 will contest the Palmerston Sprint on Saturday with Darwin trainer Tayarn Halter scratching Your Excellency earlier in the week.
First emergency Niccoco from the Garry Lefoe Jnr stable will start, but second emergency Jackanory from the Dick Leech stable has been scratched.
All of the Darwin Cup runners were vetted Friday morning with Hensler confirming that all 12 starters, including the three emergencies, were passed fit.
