  <title>Match preview: Adelaide v Port Adelaide</title>
  <content>
Rory Sloane is likely to get a hard tag against the Power

SUMMARY

South Australia's most important game on the footy calendar takes on extra significance for two of the premiership contenders. The 43rd edition of the Showdown promises to be a beauty, with the Crows and the Power coming off amazing results last weekend. The Crows showed tremendous fight to rally from 50 points down early in the third quarter to secure a draw against Collingwood at the MCG, while a bit of Patrick Ryder and Robbie Gray brilliance delivered the Power a thrilling two-point win over St Kilda. The top-of-the-table Crows will be slight favourites to win their fifth straight Showdown, but the fifth-placed Power need a victory to realistically keep their hopes of finishing in the top four alive. This is one of those genuine 'flip a coin' games that will more than likely go down to the wire.

IT'S A BIG WEEK FOR ... Rory Sloane

PREDICTION: Adelaide by four points
