  <title>'Complete rubbish': Eddie blasts Mick rumour</title>
  <content>
COLLINGWOOD president Eddie McGuire has rejected suggestions Mick Malthouse could be headed back to the Magpies as director of coaching.
A report emerged this morning the 2010 premiership coach has a job lined up to return to the Magpies next year.
But McGuire flatly shot down those rumours.
"That's complete rubbish," he said on Triple M.
AFL DAILY:
"I can tell you right now that is made up.
"That is just made up, there have been no discussions. It hasn't even crossed anyone's mind.
"He would have been a great director of football (coaching) five years ago, when the job was there.
"It's just not happening."
McGuire and Malthouse were seen together two weeks ago - sitting side by side at Collingwood's come-from-behind win over West Coast at Etihad Stadium.
The VFL/AFL coaching record holder quit the Magpies after the 2011 Grand Final as Nathan Buckley took over the role for the 2012 season under the agreed succession plan.
Malthouse was supposed to transition into the director of coaching role for the 2012 season under a three-year deal.
Buckley's coaching future remains unclear despite Collingwood's recent run of good form.
