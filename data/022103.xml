  <title>Asylum seeker found dead on Manus Island</title>
  <content>
AN asylum seeker on Manus Island has been found dead.
It's understood the Iranian man, who was seeking asylum in Australia, took his own life.
The Department of Immigration and Border Protection has yet to confirm the incident but Sky News reports the man was found dead in a new transit facility on the island.
It's understood he had suffered from mental health issues.
Refugees and asylum seekers inside the centre confirmed the incident to News Corp.
It's understood the man's family has not yet been informed.
Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has been contacted for comment.
Refugees waiting for resettlement in the United States were told to move to the transit centre last month as preparations begin for the main detention centre to shut down by October.
Their re-settlement has been at the centre of a leaked phone call from the White House between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
During the heated January 28 phone call, revealed in full by the Washington Post on Friday last week, Mr Turnbull corralled the new president into endorsing the refugee deal.
The prime minister assured Mr Trump the United States was not obliged to accept a single refugee, needing only to process those held in detention to honour the bargain.
Mr Turnbull admitted Australia would rather take some of America's most "unattractive guys" rather than a Nobel Peace Prize winner who came by boat. The president praised Mr Turnbull for being "worse than I am" on rejecting refugees, but bemoaned the agreement.
Mr Trump described the agreement as "a horrible deal, a disgusting deal" which would make him look like a "dope" and a weak and ineffective leader. The agreement, struck with the Obama administration, involved the US accepting up to 1250 refugees held on Manus Island and Nauru, in return for Australia taking asylum seekers from Central America.
More than 1600 refugees have expressed interest in the US resettlement deal, which is expected to offer about 1200 places.
