Three armed men are on the run after a man was bashed in Adelaide's northern suburbs.
Two men armed with a crowbar and baseball bat broke into a home on Bendle Street, Elizabeth Park, just after 7pm on Monday and bashed a man, then fled with a third man in a Hyundai sedan, police say.
The injured man was taken to the Lyell McEwin Hospital with injuries to his arm and cuts to his head.
