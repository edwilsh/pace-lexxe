  <content>
All river basins in Tasmania's north have been placed on flood watch.
Widespread rain has been recorded in the region since Friday afternoon, with totals in excess of 30mm recorded around Mt Barrow and Lake Mackenzie, the Bureau of Meteorology says.
Further falls are expected overnight Saturday through Sunday as a cold front moves across the state and minor flooding may develop in some rivers in the north of the state from Sunday on.
