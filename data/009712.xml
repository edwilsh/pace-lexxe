  <title>Barca bombshell! Club CONFIRMS Neymar to PSG is ON</title>
  <content>
NEYMAR has told Barcelona that he plans to leave the club, with a blockbuster move to Paris Saint-Germain seemingly imminent.
Barcelona responded Wednesday with a statement saying the Brazil striker's 222 million euro ($262 million) release clause must be paid in full, a scenario which until recently seemed beyond the reach of any rival.
Barcelona said Neymar and his father met with club officials Wednesday to say he wanted to leave. Club spokesman Josep Vives said the team "referred them to the release clause in his current contract, which as of July 1 is 222 million euros, which must be paid in full."

Football: Barcelona confirms Neymar is seeking a future elsewhere.

Barca admits Neymar wants out

Neymar Jr hasn't trained on Wednesday with the permission of the coach

1/2 PSG going to La Liga offices this afternoon. La Liga say they will NOT accept â‚¬220m payment to trigger Neymar release clause

2/2 La Liga: "We will not accept the money for the clause. We have doubts this money is in accordance with UEFA Financial Fair Play rules."
If PSG pays the clause, it would shatter the previous world record transfer of 105 million euros (then $116 million) that Manchester United paid for France midfielder Paul Pogba last year.
Neymar spent 30 minutes at the club's training ground in Sant Joan Despi telling his teammates and coach Ernesto Valverde that he wanted to leave. Valverde gave him permission to go. Vives, however, noted that Neymar "is still under contract with FC Barcelona, but with temporary permission to not take part in the training session." Last year, the 25-year-old Neymar signed a new contract with Barcelona that tied him to the Catalan club through 2021.
Barcelona said Neymar did not specify where he wants to play next, but the only club speculated to be after him - and one of few which could handle the cost of the transfer - is the Qatari-owned PSG.
PSG did not answer messages from The Associated Press seeking comment. Driving a blue Audi with two passengers, Neymar breezed in and out of the Baarcelona's training ground outside the city. He had arrived in Spain on Tuesday night after holding publicity events for both his personal brand and Barcelona in China.
Club president Josep Bartomeu had repeatedly said that the club would do everything to convince Neymar to stay.
Both Bartomeu and Spanish league president Javier Tebas have said they will consider filing a complaint to UEFA if they think the PSG transfer violates financial fair play rules.
But in an interview with Spanish paper AS, La Liga chief Javier Tebas declared the league will challenge PSG's right to pay the release clause, while then declaring that La Liga is bigger than Neymar.
"No. We will not accept that money from a club like PSG that, without belonging to La Liga, want to embrace the rights of our organisation," he said.
He added: "The complaint is ready and will be presented to UEFA, the European Union, and the Swiss Courts, those are the tribunals that have power. Basically, La Liga will denounce the unfairness of competing against state-backed clubs; the teams that receive economic investment from countries that gift players to their fans at the cost of taking them from other clubs.
"In terms of PSG, it is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state. PSG's accounts show that they have a larger commercial income than Real Madrid and Manchester United, which is to say that the value of their brand is greater than those clubs. Well, that is impossible."
As for Neymar, he sledged: "He is a fantastic player, but honestly, I believe that La Liga is greater than Neymar. With the greatest of respect to him, I would be more worried if we were talking about [Lionel] Messi or Cristiano [Ronaldo]."
Strangely, however, PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has told Moroccan television station Medi 1 TV: "All of this is talk. Neymar is a Barcelona player and we will see what happens with him.
"PSG respect all contracts that exist between other teams and their players. I hope to speak about this issue another time."
However, he added: "PSG's ambition is to have great players who are recognised around the world.
"That helps to increase our reputation and the club look to have coaches and players who can help us realise our expectations."
With his lightning-quick feet, creative instincts and scoring touch, Neymar helped maintain Barcelona as one of the top clubs in Europe for the past four seasons as he blossomed into a worldwide star.
He teamed up with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez to make an almost unstoppable attack. Neymar scored 105 goals - some of them true gems - and was a key playmaker for Barcelona as it won a Champions League, two Spanish leagues, three Copa del Reys, one Club World Cup, a UEFA Super Cup and two Spanish Super Cups.
Yet, even before this drawn-out saga, Neymar also provided more than one headache for his club.
His transfer from Brazilian club Santos in 2013 became the source of a legal dispute that has dogged Barcelona even since. Barcelona said at the time that his transfer cost 57 million euros, while an investigative judge says that the real cost was at least 83.3 million euros.
Now Bartomeu and predecessor Sandro Rosell, who resigned as president of the club amid the transfer scandal, are facing trial on charges of fraudulent administration.
Neymar has also mixed his flair for fancy goals with bouts of immaturity on the field, often needlessly taunting defenders and trying to upstage them with his dribbling skills.
But nobody doubts Neymar is one of the greatest talents of his generation. PSG saw it first-hand in last season's Champions League. In his most memorable performance at Camp Nou, Neymar scored two goals and set up two more to lead Barcelona to a 6-1 rout to overturn PSG's 4-0 first-leg win in the last 16. Unless PSG gets last-second jitters, Neymar will take over a team that is searching for a leader who can achieve elusive Champions League success.

BREAKING:  give Neymar permission to miss training this morning. More on Sky Sports News.

Neymar hasn't trained with Barcelona today. Deal close with PSG but still not yet signed.

Neymar didn't train today + told team mates he's off to PSG. Key players were fed up with situation and wanted him to say it to the group.
