  <title>Heavy snow leads to avalanches on Vic Alps</title>
  <content>
Heavy snowfall has led to avalanches on the Victorian Alps, with emergency services warning tourists to steer clear of remote areas.
Avalanches on Monday led ski resorts to conduct controlled avalanches to reduce risk ahead of Tuesday's forecast warmer weather and strong winds, Vic Emergency said.
"You should avoid activities such as skiing, snowboarding, or hiking in remote areas of the Alps as there is an increased risk of avalanches," an advice message read.
