  <title>Plea for return of stolen Jim Deane SANFL medal</title>
  <content>
SA football great Jim Deane's first SANFL trophy - the 1945 Tomkins Medal - has been stolen.
The medal as the best player in the SANFL's senior colts (under-19s) competition was taken from his daughter's Seaton home on Thursday.
Deane's family is appealing for the medal to be returned rather than dumped, as was the case with five of the Knuckey Cups - the South Adelaide Football Club best player trophy - that were stolen from Deane several years ago.
The 1945 Tomkins Medal is on a gold chain.
"It is the most valuable thing taken from us," granddaughter Claire Thomson told The Advertiser on Monday.
"With Jim's name on the medal we can't imagine it would be pawned off. So if it is thrown away, we hope it will be returned."
Deane's two Magarey Medals - the first he won outright in 1953 and the second (1957) that was awarded retrospectively in 1998, 12 years before his death - are in safe keeping with the SANFL.
Deane's widow Colleen put the Magarey Medals in the hands of the SANFL's history group led by Chris Halbert exactly two years ago.
The theft of the 1945 Tomkins Medal has been reported to SA Police.
