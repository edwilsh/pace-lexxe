  <title>Blue Nick Graham out for two games after VFL Tribunal challenge fails</title>

Nick Graham in action for Carlton against Sydney in round six

CARLTON midfielder Nick Graham will be unavailable for two matches after he failed to overturn a rough conduct charge at the VFL Tribunal on Tuesday night.

Graham was charged for engaging in rough conduct against Geelong player James Tsitas during Saturday's clash between the Northern Blues and Geelong at Ikon Park. 

Graham, who was dropped for the Blues' round 19 AFL clash against the Cats, could have accepted a one-match ban for the incident, which was assessed as careless conduct with medium impact and high contact.

But he chose to contest the charge at the Tribunal on Tuesday night and will now miss matches against Essendon on Saturday and West Coast in round 21.

The 23-year-old signed a one-year extension for 2017 but remains uncontracted for next season.

He has played nine games in his fifth season, averaging 19 possessions.
