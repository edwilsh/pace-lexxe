UPDATE 8:35am:  Families join together to release a statement:

"Today we lost Myuran and Andrew," the Sukumaran and Chan families said in a statement.

"Our sons, our brothers. In the ten years since they were arrested, they did all they could to make amends, helping many others."
The family said They asked for mercy, but there was none.

"They were immensely grateful for all the support they received. We too, will be forever grateful."
Eight prisoners, including Bali nine organisers Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, have been executed in Indonesia.

The executions were carried out at 12.35am local time (3.35am AEST) on Nusakambangan prison island. But it took up to 27 minutes for all the prisoners to die, with a spokesman for the Attorney-General Tony Spontana saying they were "shot at 00.35 and died at 01.02."

Andrew Chan's brother, Michael, took to Twitter on Wednesday morning to express his grief.

The ninth condemned prisoner, Filipina maid Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, was given a last-minute reprieve from the firing squad.

Attorney-General spokesman Tony Spontana said Veloso's execution had been postponed because of the Philippine president's request in connection with the human trafficking suspect surrendering herself in the Philippines.
He said Veloso was required to provide her testimony.
Relatives and friends of the condemned were in a tent near the killing field and became hysterical when the shots were heard, a source told Fairfax Media.
Among those in the tent were Chan and Sukumaran's Australian lawyer, Julian McMahon, Bayside Church senior pastor Christie Buckingham and Salvation Army minister David Soper, who were allowed to spend precious last hours with the Australians.
The men's Indonesian lawyer, Professor Todung Mulya Lubis, tweeted his defeat soon after the news was announced.

Veloso, a maid who was arrested smuggling 2.6 kilograms of heroin into Yogyakarta, always maintained she was innocent and was not aware there was drugs in the lining of her suitcase.
She said she was set up by her godsister Kristina, who allegedly bought her a suitcase and new clothes in Malaysia and told her a job as a domestic helper was waiting for her in Indonesia.
Veloso's recruiter, Maria Kristina Sergio, reportedly surrendered to authorities in the Philippines on April 28, the day Veloso was due to be executed.
Mr Spontana said Veloso would need to give evidence in the court case.
Communications were jammed at Wijayapura Port opposite Nusakambangan as the executions took pace. 

Mary Jane Veloso was spared at the last minute.
Tears, songs mark emotional vigil
Mothers of Mercy staged a moving candlelight vigil, praying for mercy and for President Joko Widodo, and playing a version  of the Leonard Cohen anthem Hallelujah.
Evangelist Owen Pomana said he had come to Cilacap to honour his friend Andrew Chan.
A New Zealander, he intends to do a haka when Chan's body is brought through the harbour gates in an ambulance.
"I've learned a lot from Andrew Chan, he's the brother I never had," Mr Pomana said.
He said he had always dreamed of travelling with Chan on a Harley Davidson motorcycle, working out with him and ministering to people, who had been "messed up" just like them.
"I'm a reformed prisoner too. I had a a dark past but I'm evidence of the fact you can be rehabilitated," Mr Pomana said.
He had helped Andrew Chan source things he needed in Bali's Kerobokan jail including COR manikins and hot water tanks for the women's showers.
"I want to honour my friend. Just being here is a statement that we care. He's my friend, he's my brother."
