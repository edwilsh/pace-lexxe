POLICE Commissioner Ian Stewart has been reappointed for another three years in the role.

Despite internal criticism about his leadership and morale in the police force, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk today announced Commissioner Stewart's contract was renewed after a Cabinet meeting on the Gold Coast.

"Cabinet has endorsed the recommendation made by (Police) Minister Mark Ryan under the Act," she said.

"It's incredibly important that we have a clear sense of stability in this state."

Ms Palaszczuk also praised Commissioner Stewart's handling of natural disasters such as Cyclone Debbie.

Commissioner Stewart's reappointment comes as he had assured Queenslanders the terror threat remained at probable.
