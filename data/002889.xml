  <title>Carl and his burgers choose Newy</title>
  <content>
A Carl's Junior store in New Zealand gives an idea of what the Wallsend store might look like when complete.

International hamburger franchise Carls Junior is aiming to put its first Australian store on the Wallsend site.

At the traffic lights on the corner of Douglas Street, the property sold through Gittins Property agent Rick Gittins recently for $1.275 million.
He said the property also received very strong interest from several oil companies wishing to develop the site into a service station.
Lindsay Brennan, general manager of Nelson Bay-based independent liquor chain BKG Group, is the first franchisee to sign up in Australia for the signature burger brand.
"We will have a territory from the Hawkesbury to Coffs Harbour and inland to Tamworth," he said.
Mr Brennan is aiming to get the Wallsend store open by August.
"The existing building will be demolished and built from scratch," he said.
Marketed to 18-to-35-year-olds, in the US the 70-year-old burger chain is known for its two slogans: "Eat like you mean it" and "It's going to get messy", as well as a collection of sultry commercials featuring celebrities such as Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian.

The old Dumbrell Springs building at Wallsend is to be demolished.
