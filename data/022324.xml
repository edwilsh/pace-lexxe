Car in Telarah Lagoon

exit

A car was partially submerged in Telarah Lagoon on Monday morning.
The white sedan was on the edge of the water behind trees on the New England Highway side of the lagoon.

Photos of the car started to circulate on social media just after 11am.
The windscreen of the two door vehicle was damaged and the front windows were open.
Central Hunter Police told Fairfax Media they did not have details to provide about the incident. 

It is not clear how or when the car ended up in the lagoon.

Do you know more about the incident? Anyone who has information on how or why the vehicle was in the water is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or Maitland Police on 4934 0200.
