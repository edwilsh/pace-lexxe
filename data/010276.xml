CALLOUS thieves have stolen an elderly man's mobility scooter in a shocking early morning robbery.
The 69-year-old man was set upon by two thugs while walking his dog at the Rosebud foreshore near the rear of the local bowling club about 6:15am yesterday.
The thieves demanded the man's wallet, which he was not carrying at the time, before forcing the elderly man off his scooter and stripping him of his jacket, watch and rings.
The victim was forced to walk to a nearby shopping centre and alert police to the theft while the offenders made off with his belongings.
There is no description of the offenders available at this time but police are urging anyone who witnessed the incident to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
