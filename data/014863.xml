Merewether's Ryan Callinan worked overtime but could not find the scores needed as he bowed out of the US Open of Surfing at Huntington Beach in round three on Friday (AEST).

Callinan recorded 10 scores in finishing third with a best two-wave total of 10.4. Alejo Muniz (12.5) and Hiroto Ohhara (11.83) progressed at the 10,000-point qualifying series event.

Callinan, 43rd on the QS before the contest, earned 4.93 for a frontside aerial then 5.47 for three-turn ride and needed a 6.36 late.

Lasting rides were hard to come by in the tricky conditions and the goofy-footer went for broke without success.
The 2016 championship tour competitor earlier finished second in round two to progress.
There are three 10,000-point and three 6000-point events left on the schedule as Callinan tries to get back on the championship tour with a top 10 year-ending ranking from his five best performances.
