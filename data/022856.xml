A murder-accused man has faced court in Melbourne after a death in suburbia.
Hung Anh Vu, 45, from Sunshine West appeared briefly in Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Monday following the weekend death of 44-year-old Hung Viet Nguyen.
Mr Nguyen died just after 8.30pm on Saturday at a house at Sunshine West.
A 42-year-old woman who was present in the house was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
Vu was remanded to reappear before the court on January 8 for a committal mention.
