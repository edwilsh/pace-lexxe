Tighter security checks could be introduced for Australian domestic flights following an alleged terror plot to bomb a plane.
Identity checks, full-body scanners and restrictions on liquids similar to security measures for international flights are reportedly being considered by the federal government, according to The Australian.
Two Sydney men have been charged over the alleged plot to bring down an Abu Dhabi-bound plane on July 15 using an improvised explosive device.
