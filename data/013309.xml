  <title>Pistorius 'hospitalised with chest pain'</title>
  <content>
SHAMED athlete Oscar Pistorius has been treated in hospital after complaining of chest pains while in prison for murdering Reeva Steenkamp, it's claimed.
Initial reports were that staff at the Atteridgeville Prison in South Africa thought he had suffered a heart attack, reports The Citizens.
A prison spokesman said: "We can state that offender Oscar Pistorius was taken to an outside hospital facility this morning for a medical examination, and is expected back in the facility later today,"
The athlete argued at his murder trial that he thought his girlfriend was a burglar.
But prosecutors claimed the killing was the culmination of a terrible fight between the lovers.
An initial conviction of manslaughter, for which he served less than a year behind bars, was later upgraded to murder on appeal.
If the state's appeal to extend Pistorius' six year sentence fails, he could serve just two and a half more years for the killing.
