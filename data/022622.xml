  <title>Former Education boss accused of misconduct</title>
  <content>
A FORMER Queensland education boss allegedly used "unspoken pressure" to secure a job for a friend of former department director-general Julie Grantham.
Ex-regional director Glen Arnold Hoppner pleaded not guilty in the Brisbane District Court on Monday to one count of misconduct in relationship to public office.
The court heard Hoppner allegedly told his subordinate in June 2012 to appoint Hunter Paltridge, a friend of Ms Grantham, as head of programs at a state-run sports centre before interviewing other candidates.
Ms Grantham was the director-general of the education department between 2009 and 2012, earning $400,000 a year and reporting directly to the minister.
In 2015, Mrs Grantham was found guilty of abusing her office by landing her son Lachlan a job at the Runaway Bay Sports Centre, where her husband also worked.
Ms Grantham was given a suspended six-month jail term and was forced to pay back $17,000 to the State Government, to cover the salary paid to her son.
