  <title>Vic priest due in court over child porn</title>
  <content>
An Anglican parish priest is expected to face a Melbourne court on child pornography charges after police raided a church and house.
The 52-year-old was arrested on Thursday when officers searched a Sunshine church and house, part of a 12-month investigation by the Joint Anti Child Exploitation Team.
He was charged with transmitting child pornography and related offences and bailed to appear in Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Friday
The Anglican Diocese of Melbourne on Thursday confirmed the man arrested was a priest and said he had been "stood down by the archbishop with immediate effect".
"Archbishop Philip Freier said the church abhorred the abuse and exploitation of children and would co-operate fully with police," a church statement said.
