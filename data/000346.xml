  <title>Man burnt in Sydney chemical factory blaze</title>
  <content>
A man has suffered burns to 60 per cent of his body in a large fire at a chemical disposal factory in Sydney's west.
The injured 40-year-old was airlifted to hospital soon after emergency services were called to the blaze on Links Road at St Marys just before 9am on Monday.
Large amounts of smoke was billowing out of the building with firefighters quickly requesting more help to bring the fire under control.
A NSW Fire and Rescue spokesman told AAP up to 70 firefighters tackled the blaze, which has since been contained.
It's not yet known what sparked the fire but reports indicate it may have involved a processing machine and aerosol cans exploding inside the building, he said.
