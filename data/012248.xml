  <title>Call for Aust climate research overhaul</title>
  <content>
Australia's climate agencies need to be overhauled and about 80 new research positions created to stop the sector falling behind the rest of the world, a new report shows.
An Australian Academy of Science review of the country's climate research agencies has called for the creation of a new overarching body - or the beefing up and overhauling of existing organisations.
The review also recommended about 80 new research positions, including roughly 30 scientists and modellers, be created over the next four years following cuts to the CSIRO's climate team.
"Australia's climate research sector is a fraction of the size of those in America or Europe, but we cover most of the Southern Hemisphere in terms of climate modelling and understanding," Professor Trevor McDougall, who led the review, said on Thursday.
"Many of our universities are considered to be world-class in this effort, but as a country we are falling behind in areas such as climate modelling."
The academy put forward multiple options for overhauling the climate science sector, including the creation of a new office of climate research, outside of the environment and energy department.
Another suggestion was establishing a new national agency to oversee existing research capacity.
Other options include streamlining all climate research in the Bureau of Meteorology or CSIRO to reduce inefficiency.
But regardless of the future shape of Australia's climate research sector, the academy said current climate modelling capacity was lacking.
"If these gaps are not filled, the effects will not be immediately catastrophic, but Australia will increasingly be less and less able to have a sufficient level of information to make informed decisions," the report said.
