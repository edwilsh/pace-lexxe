  <title>FREE WINGS: Coast teen pilot scholarship launches</title>
  <content>
BUDDING pilots have a chance to earn their wings for free as a Coast trainer offers a scholarship to help those who might struggle with the cost.
Caloundra business GoFly Aviation wants 14-18 year-olds to apply for its cadet scholarship program.
"The GoFly cadet scholarship is designed to assist future young aviators who display a passion for aviation and who have experienced some hardship or barriers in following their dream of learning to fly a plane," chief pilot Damien Wills said.
He has launched the inaugural scholarship program, valued at up to $10,000.
The scholarship will cover all on-ground and in-air tuition required for a student to achieve their pilot certificate.
It is a part-time course which can be done over a period of up to two years.
Applicants must be from the Coast and come from a household where the combined income is less than $80,000 a year.
They must submit a letter of up to 500 words outlining why they want to become a pilot, their aviation industry career aspirations and any hardships they are working to overcome.
Mr Wills said he would judge applications with the help of a representative from Recreational Aviation Australia.
Entries close on September 30.
