  <title>Showdown 43: Adelaide thrashes Port Adelaide by 84 points in wild weather</title>
  <content>
It will be impossible to keep Adelaide fans quiet today after the Crows spanked Port Adelaide with a record 84-point win at Adelaide Oval in wet and windy conditions.
It was Adelaide's biggest win over the Power as the Crows took a 22-21 lead in Showdowns while retaining top spot on the AFL ladder.
The Crows dominated the game even though early on they could not make it count on the scoreboard.
Then the floodgates opened, with Adelaide in front by 36 points at half-time before a remarkable seven-goal third quarter.
There were more awesome goals from Eddie Betts and a superb goal on the run from Brad Crouch as the Crows surged ahead to lead by 62 points at the final break.
The final score was 18.22 (130) to 7.4 (46) as Adelaide chalked up five Showdowns in a row with yesterday's victory in front of a crowd of just over 45,000.

Best-on-ground Sam Jacobs outplayed Paddy Ryder while up forward Betts and Josh Jenkins kicked four goals each and Taylor Walker two.
Brad Crouch had 29 disposals, his brother Matt gathered 34 and Rory Sloane 30.
For Port Adelaide, Robbie Gray and Jared Polec were the best performers on a forgettable day.
Port Adelaide coach Ken Hinkley described the result as disappointing and unacceptable.
"Well you can only go back and focus on it during the week and say well this is just not at a level that we will accept," he said.
"Maybe we have to be prepared to look at some of the positions that are in there and say ok well if you're not getting it done we'll make some change if that's what we have to do."
Adelaide coach Don Pyke was more than pleased with the result, especially with the finals approaching.
"You know at the start of the year you'd say you want to make the finals and you want to make top-four and we're in a position where I think tonight we've secured top four," he said.
"So there's no reason to suggest we shouldn't be shooting to finish top-two and give ourselves the best opportunity come finals."
Adelaide will this week assess David Mackay's thigh injury.
Adelaide takes on Essendon this Saturday while the fifth-placed Power plays Collingwood at Adelaide Oval on Sunday.
