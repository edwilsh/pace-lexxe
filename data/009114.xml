  <title>Seven Network poised to capitalise on Ninja Warrior success</title>
  <content>
The Seven Network is searching for ways to capitalise on the success of Australian Ninja Warrior with meetings being held to secure a similar format. 
Nine Network's Australian Ninja Warrior has been the most successful television format of the year to date, smashing its primetime rivals Yummy Mummies and MasterChef. Despite its short season, the show's grand finale became the most watched non-sport program of 2017.

Sources within Seven confirmed the network is interested in securing a sports entertainment show.

Spartan: Ultimate Team Challenge originated in the United States and sees teams of five tackle a one-mile obstacle course in a bid to win a $US250,000 prize.

The teams are comprised of two men and two women who are matched with an "elite Spartan athlete" who is picked by the show and is the team captain. 
The first season premiere was watched by 4.8 million people in America, with the final episode, the Season One Championship watched by 3.23 million people. The second season didn't fare as well with just 2.19 million tuning in for the finale.
The show is broadcast on NBC in the US and on Foxtel in Australia.
