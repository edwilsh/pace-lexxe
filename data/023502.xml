  <title>Wreckage of US Osprey found</title>
  <content>
The Australian Navy has located a missing US military aircraft that crashed in waters off the Queensland coast, leaving three Marines presumed dead.
The HMAS Melville arrived in Shoalwater Bay, near Rockhampton, overnight to join a recovery operation after the tilt-rotor MV-22 Osprey plunged into the sea during a scheduled military exercise on Saturday.
"Shortly after commencing survey operations in the area, the submerged aircraft was located," Defence Minister Marise Payne said on Monday evening.
