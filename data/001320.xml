  <title>Jason Dundas opens up about his naked selfie</title>
  <content>
TELEVISION presenter and model Jason Dundas has opened up about the vexing motivation behind his controversial nude selfie on social media.
He said his naked selfie was a cheeky statement against the over-sexualised nature of social media.
"I jumped on the bandwagon to poke fun, but I started getting smashed with (direct messages) saying your account is about to be ripped down," he said.
"Clothes are overrated. Little afternoon stretch in my yoga room," Dundas posted with a naked shot on Instagram earlier this year. An hour later, the post was deleted.
Dundas told Confidential: "I've got this love-hate relationship with Instagram. Whenever I post things, I lose followers. When I don't post things, I gain followers.
"I'm just so confused about it. And I'm so frustrated with people posting blatant sexuality that gets a huge following. I try to be honest, educate people, share experiences and be vulnerable.
