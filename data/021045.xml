  <title>Storm passes, now for flood warnings</title>
  <content>
ALL severe weather warnings for SA have been cancelled, but parts of the Adelaide Hills are on flood watch, as creeks and rivers rapidly fill in the aftermath of the storm.
The SES is warning of localised flooding for parts of the Adelaide Hills as creeks and rivers rapidly fill after strong winds and rain lashed parts of the state.
The SES says there is a risk of localised flooding for the Upper Onkaparinga River, impacting on roads and homes upstream of Verdun.
Mount Barker Road at Verdun and Hahndorf has now reopened after earlier being closed because of water over the roadway.
People in the area should follow their emergency flood plan now and prepare for flooding in the area.
