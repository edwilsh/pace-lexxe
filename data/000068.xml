  <title>Possible delays at Brisbane Airport</title>
  <content>
Passengers departing Brisbane Airport on Monday have been warned to prepare for possible delays due to emergency security measures brought in nationally after an alleged terror plot was foiled in Sydney.
A Brisbane Airport spokeswoman said there are no significant delays at present but passengers must arrive two hours before domestic flights and three hours before international departures.
She said passengers can expect to see an increased police presence, slower security practices and more explosive trace tests taking place and urged travellers to check in early and bring less carry-on luggage.
