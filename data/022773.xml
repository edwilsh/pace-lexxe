  <title>Bus parked in All Blacks reshuffle</title>
  <content>
JULIAN Savea remains on the periphery of the All Blacks after being left out of Steve Hansen's 33-man squad for the Rugby Championship, which kicks off against the Wallabies in Sydney on August 19.
Savea, New Zealand's equal second highest tryscorer of all time with 46, was left out of the All Blacks' side for the opening two Tests against the British and Irish Lions in June, before starting the third Test on the left wing.
But the powerful 27-year-old, whose nickname is 'The Bus,' had an unhappy night in the drawn Test and came under fire for bombing an early chance at Eden Park by dropping the ball with the line in sight.

Rugby: Sonny Bill Williams has had his suspension reduced making him available for the Bledisloe Cup.

Crusaders flanker Matt Todd was also left out with Hansen unable to squeeze three No 7's into his squad.
Hansen has recalled Chiefs prop Nepo Laulala, who shapes as Charlie Faumuina's long-term replacement, Hurricanes outside back Nehe Milner-Skudder and star hooker Dane Coles after all three players made successful comebacks from long-term injury setbacks over the last 18 months.
"Firstly, we congratulate all players selected for the Rugby Championship, particularly Nepo and Nehe, who we welcome back," Hansen said.
"Conversely, we commiserate with those who have missed out, particularly Julian Savea and the unlucky Matt Todd, both of whom have made great contributions to the All Blacks jersey and will do so again in the future, I'm sure."

Super Rugby whiz-kid Damian McKenzie has been named as a replacement player for vice-captain Ben Smith, who will start his six-month sabbatical after the second Bledisloe Test on August 26 in Dunedin.
As they have done previously, the All Blacks have also named an apprentice for the campaign, with 22-year-old Chiefs and former New Zealand under-20s prop Atu Moli called into the squad for their home Tests.
"We've used the apprentice program in the past and think it's hugely beneficial for a player's development, so we look forward to working with Atu," Hansen said.
"He's an outstanding player and an impressive young man who has a big future in the game."
Ardie Savea and Jordie Barrett are two previous All Blacks apprentice players.

After their drawn series against the Lions, Hansen said he was looking forward to building on the midyear Tests and expected a fiercely competitive Championship.
"For us, it's case of re-establishing ourselves and building on our good work from last year and during the recent New Zealand Lions Series," he said.
"There were some clear things learnt in the Lions series and this is a great chance for us to implement those; to continue to grow our skill execution and the mental side of our game, and develop our leadership and the leadership group.
"The first two Bledisloe Cup matches will set the tone, as we know the Australians will throw everything at us, while we're expecting the South Africans and Argentinians to be as bruising and physical as always.
"We've learnt since the introduction of Argentina that there is a massive travelling component to the Championship, which comes at a cost at the end of the year, so we'll be looking to implement some new strategies to try and overcome that."
The All Blacks won back the Rugby Championship last year after the Wallabies took the trophy in 2015 following their 27-19 comeback win in Sydney.
