  <title>O'Neil tipped as likely to win PNG leadership on Wednesday</title>
  <content>
It appears at this stage that Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O'Neil has the numbers to form the next government when Parliament sits tomorrow.
This is despite several of the writs not being returned and the final composition of the House not being finalised yet.
Retired Australian academic Dr Bill Standish, who has observed the last seven PNG elections, tells Bruce Hill that although MPs swapping sides unexpectedly at the last minute have been a feature of previous post election sittings of Parliament, it appears as if Mr O'Neil is ahead of his rivals.
