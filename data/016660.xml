  <title>Ali Hussaini eyes wrestling gold for Australia</title>
  <content>
Four years ago, Ali Hussaini fled war-torn Afghanistan. In May, the 24-year-old became an Australian champion in freestyle wrestling.

He's undefeated and considered one of the best wrestlers in the country.

"I'm very happy in Australia," Ali Hussaini said.

"There's no fighting, no shooting, no Taliban, I'm safe here. I'm training and working, it's a very good country."

His brother was among family members killed during the war in Afghanistan.

Ali still remembers travelling to Kabul for training.

"People came out shooting and killing it was no good. But one day I think, I'll go to Australia."

He arrived in 2013 as a refugee on Christmas Island.

Now, the 24-year-old is living in Sydney on a bridging visa and is sending back money to his family in Afghanistan.

Ali dreams of representing Australia on the world stage.

But he can't represent his adopted country until he becomes a citizen.

Competing at next year's Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast appears unlikely but the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo is a more realistic goal.

"My dream will come true and I will win a gold medal in the Olympics for Australia," he said.
