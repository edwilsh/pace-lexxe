  <title>Arguably NSW's best</title>
  <content>
LEFT: Talent: Jade Steenkamp (left) played a starring role in South Coast winning the NSW PSSA Girls Basketball title and was named in the NSW representative team. ABOVE: Top effort: South Coast's Ruby Sargent-Wilson in possession in the win over Riverina.

South Coast can claim to be the best primary school girls' basketball association in NSW following an unbeaten run in the NSW PSSA Championships at Berkeley.
It was South Coast's first championships since 2003 and featured players from seven schools based from Woonona PS in the Illawarra north to Batemans Bay in the south.
South Coast won six pool games before beating Sydney North 30-23 in the semi-finals then MacKillop 29-20 in the final.
Mt St Thomas Public School's Jade Steenkamp was arguably the most skilled player from the 14 competing regions and along with the talented Claudea Andrews (Queanbeyan PS) were selected from South Coast in the NSW PSSA Basketball team.
The NSW girls' and boys' teams will compete in the Pacific Games in Adelaide in November, which will feature not only the elite state teams but have an international flavour, with Canada and China.
In was the third year in which coach Vicki Burke has mentored the South Coast girls' team at the NSW PSSA titles. South Coast finished sixth in 2013 and 2014 and 13th in 2012.
"To go through unbeaten, win eight games is a marvellous achievement," Burke said.
"The girls were very coachable, very team-minded and made the most of their minutes on the court and really supported their teammates when they were on court.
The 14 regions were split into two pools with South Coast beating Riverina 28-20, Western 42-19 and Sydney South West 51-11 on the opening day.
South Coast then beat Sydney East 27-17 and had a 57-25 win over North Coast, before ending the round-robin pool stage with a 25-21 win over Combined Independent Schools (CIS).

South Coast showed great composure on finals day to beat Sydney North in the semi-finals then MacKillop in the championship decider.
