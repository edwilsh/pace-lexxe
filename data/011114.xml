  <title>Bailey doubles up with impressive Dundee haul</title>
  <content>
IT was a double delight for young fisho Bailey Young at Dundee recently.
Bailey, 8, landed both a crayfish and a shark, and as a result is our Catch of the Day winner.
For his efforts, Bailey has won a Shimano 25L Back Pack with 5 compartments to store line, lures and tools (valued at $79.95 RRP).
The Shimano backpack is perfect for the fisherman on the go, allowing you to load up and take off knowing that you have all your fishing essentials in one place.
The NT News runs the Catch of the Day competition every Thursday.
To enter, send us your best horizontal (landscape) fishing photo. We'll announce the winner here each week.
Write your contact and picture details, including what you caught and where, on an envelope and send your photo to Catch of the Day, GPO Box 1401, Darwin, NT, 0801, or email ntnmail@ntnews.com.au with ``Catch of the Day'' in the subject line. You must include your full address and details of your catch with the entry.
