  <title>Three plead guilty to plotting terrorist attack on government buildings in Sydney</title>
  <content>
Two men and a teenager have pleaded guilty to plotting a terrorist attack on government buildings in Sydney.
Jibryl Almaouie, 23, and Sulayman Khalid, 22, pleaded guilty on Monday at a Supreme Court matter heard in Parramatta to planning an act of terror in late 2014.Photo: James Alcock
Another person under 18, who cannot be named, also pleaded guilty to the plan.
The plot centred on carrying out attacks on government buildings, including police headquarters, with firearms.
Almaouie, Khalid and the teen are among six involved in the plot - with the other three having pleaded guilty earlier this year.
