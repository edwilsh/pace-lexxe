  <title>Malcolm Turnbull defers decision on how Government will respond to Referendum Council</title>
  <content>
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has used his speech at Garma to further defer any official response to the Referendum Council's recommendation of constitutionally enshrining a voice for Aboriginal Australians in Parliament.
Mr Turnbull said he had learned from his involvement in the failed 1999 referendum on whether to make Australia a republic.
"Many people talk about referendums, but few people have knowledge in running one," he said.
"An all-or-nothing approach often results in nothing.
"I respect deeply the work of the Referendum Council, and I respect it by considering [their report] very carefully."
Mr Turnbull said the recommendations of the Referendum Council were being considered by Cabinet, and the final approach would have to be bipartisan in order to succeed.
"That's our way, that's how we give respect to serious matters," he said.
More to come.
