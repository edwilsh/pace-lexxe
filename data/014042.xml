JUSTIN Bieber went from being on a worldwide tour to being on an apology tour on social media for cancelling his remaining show dates, but one rock legend Gene Simmons isn't feeling sorry for the "Sorry singer.
The Kiss guitarist told  that Bieber should, "Get a life. You don't have to worry about anything. You're rich. In case you didn't notice, you're white. You've got white privilege ... You have nothing to complain about".
Still, the 67-year-old said added he wishes Bieber well.
Simmons said, "He's young; he's got lots of fans".

The photographer then told Simmons that Bieber has been spotted wearing his tour merchandise to which the rocker responded, "It's called the Beverly Hills blues."
Bieber posted a message to his 90 million Instagram followers explaining his reason for quitting the tour.
Bieber stated the chance to make his life and career more "sustainable" ultimately led him to cancel the rest of his Purpose world tour.
