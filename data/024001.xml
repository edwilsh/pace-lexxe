  <title>Kidnap 'fantasist' details revealed</title>
  <content>
THE man charged with abducting a British model has been described by neighbours as a "loner" as police hunt possible accomplices and release new pictures in the extraordinary case.
Polish man Lukasz Pawel Herba was arrested on July 18 and charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment by Italian police after UK model Chloe Ayling went missing for nearly a week.
The 20-year-old mother was dropped off at the UK consulate in Milan after being drugged and kidnapped at what she thought was a photoshoot that ended in a nightmare as she claims she was told she would be sold as a sex slave.
Neighbours of the young man have described Herba as a "loner" who lived quietly and kept to himself.
Sinead Boyce, 23, told  he had a pet rat that he walked around with on his shoulder and was very quiet in the neighbourhood he had lived in for more than four years.
"We'd see him from time-to-time carrying this rat on his shoulder. It must have been a pet or something," she said.
"He'd take it to the corner shop and all sorts. It was quite a big thing as well. It would sit fairly comfortably on his shoulder."
"One day, my mum asked him if she could see it. He came up close to her so that she could have a good look, but even then he wouldn't speak to her."
The UK's National Crime Agency and East Midlands Special Operations Police are using special kidnap and extortion units to uncover what happened in the case that has made headlines around the world.
"A house in the Oldbury area, linked to Lukasz Pawel Herba, was searched on 18 July by EMSOU officers with assistance from West Midlands Police. Computer equipment seized is being forensically examined," police said on Monday.
A note allegedly found on Herba's computer read "you are being released as a huge generosity from Black Death Group," according to media reports.
Meanwhile, details of the shadowy group from a 2015 investigation by , Joseph Cox have come to light. When approaching the "Black Death" on the dark web he found professional images of women with price tags and height and weight measurements listed. However one update to the story reports at least one of the women listed presented as "Nicole" appeared to use an image from a porn film.
Over the weekend Ms Ayling told police of her horror at being drugged and kidnapped on July 11 after being lured to a Milan studio.
She said she was grabbed from behind by a man wearing a balaclava and gloves and injected before being thrown in the boot of a car and told she would be sold to men who would feed her to tigers if they grew bored.
"I've been through a terrifying experience. I've feared for my life, second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour," she said. "I woke up in a car's boot. My wrists and ankles were handcuffed, and there was adhesive tape on my mouth.
"I was inside a bag and was only able to breathe through a small hole."
"The girls are destined for Arab countries. At least three a week are sold and when the person gets bored of her he gives her to other people," she was told.
Italian police are now working to find another four men believed to be involved in the alleged plot. Herba's role remains unclear.
On Saturday Milan deputy prosecutor Paolo Storari said: "Fantasist or not, what is clear is that he is a very dangerous man who drugged his victim as soon as she was kidnapped and put her inside a large travel bag in the boot of a car."
"His version of events is barely credible but clearly he does not deny that he was with her for the time she was missing," Storari said.
Head of the Italian investigation Lorenzo Bucossi said it was unclear if he was a "disturbed individual or someone with a real plan" but he was "certainly a dangerous person and carried out a real kidnap."
