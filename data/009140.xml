Brazilian striker Neymar Jr is leaving FC Barcelona, the Catalan football club has confirmed, as a radio report said he was moving to French team Paris Saint-Germain (PSG).
Neymar arrived at the team's training ground on Wednesday to tell teammates he was moving to Paris, Catalan radio RAC1 reported. The Brazilian striker left the training area minutes later, it said.
Having matured into one of the finest players in the world - finishing third in the 2015 Ballon d'Or vote - Neymar signed a new Barcelona contract to 2021 in October in which his buy-out clause was raised to $333 million.
Barcelona tweeted shortly after the radio report that Neymar, who has been with the Spanish club since June 2013, did not train on Wednesday with the permission of the coach.
In another Twitter posting, restricted to the sports press, the club said he was leaving but gave no further details. That tweet was confirmed by a spokeswomen.
A PSG spokesman declined to comment.
Neymar signed for Barcelona from Brazilian side Santos for $85 million, although it was later revealed the cost was closer to $149 million.
More to come.
