Whelan's Games aim after Bahamas medal

exit

After having her first taste Emily Whelan would love to experience another Commonwealth Games.

And while next year on the Gold Coast may be just out of reach, 2022 and beyond remain in the sights of the New Lambton high jumper after claiming a silver medal at the recent youth version of the event in the Bahamas.   
"It was a good experience I would love to have again," the 17-year-old said.

The year 12 student of St Francis Xavier's College at Hamilton, whose in the midst of HSC trials, fell fractionally short of a personal best of 1.83 metres en route to reaching the podium.

"I felt pretty proud to stand there and have the flag around me afterwards," Whelan said.
In humid conditions and 33-degree heat she ended up reaching 1.79m in a head-to-head battle with Northern Ireland winner Sommer Lecky. 
Whelan, an Adamstown New Lambton Athletics Club member coached remotely by 2006 Commonwealth Games representative Mark Taylor, said it was a career highlight.
Her next major challenge will be attempting to qualify for the IAAF World Under-20 Championships in Finland in July.

* NEWCASTLE basketballer Isabel Palmer is one step away from the Under-16 World Cup in India in October after being named in an extended Sapphires squad.

Palmer will join 17 other players for an Australian under-16 women's training camp in Canberra next month. She began a scholarship with Basketball Australia's Centre Of Excellence in the nation's capital last month.

The Sapphires are coached by Shannon Seebohm, who was last week appointed as Newcastle Basketball's coaching director as the Hunters push towards joining the WNBL.

* STILL on basketball and the week-long under-18 School Sport Australia Championships tip off in the ACT on Sunday with NSW opening their campaign against the hosts at Belconnen in both men's and women's divisions.   
The NSW Primary School Sport Association Girl's Championships take place in Tuggeranong from next Tuesday (August 15).
* LIAM Dunn was named the 2017 Ken Pilgrim Player Of The Year at Wednesday night's Newcastle Junior Rugby League presentation.

The under-14 prop was part of this year's NSW Country Championship final campaign.
Coach's award from that same team went to fellow Western Suburbs product and five-eighth Macualey Aoake.

Fullback Jayden Murray received the under-15 coach's prize.
* WINDALE Junior Rugby League Football Club will hold a gala day next Sunday (August 20) in a bid to help rebuild for next season. 
Nominations for under-6 and under-8 teams close on Thursday.
* HOCKEY duo Grace Baxter and Megan Roso have been selected in the NSW under-13 girl's squad.
