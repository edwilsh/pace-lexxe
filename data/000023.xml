The search for missing kayaker Junichi Yoshimura has stretched into its fourth day as the keen fisherman's family prepares to arrive from Japan.

On Sunday, Victoria Police spokesman Alistair Parsons said water police searched overnight and would continue on Monday as part of their regular patrols.
Mr Yoshimura, 41, has been working as a baker at Torquay's Zeally Bay Sourdough. Business owner, Joel Farnan, said he still hoped for a positive outcome. Photo: Facebook
"[Monday] is the greatest opportunity [to find him] because the winds will die down," Mr Farnan said.
"I know that we have got some really good people - the water police and police air wing have been doing just everything they can... to find him."

Mr Farnan said his employee's family was due to arrive in Melbourne on Tuesday morning and hoped there would be some good news.

Mr Yoshimura's colleagues raised the alarm when the baker failed to arrive for work on Friday.
His friends located his car, a white 2002 Subaru Forester with registration RXS891, at the boat ramp.
But his kayak, a distinctive "2 Monks" boat in canary yellow, remains missing.
Saturday's search was hampered by the extreme weather as wind gusts topped 50 knots in the bay.
Water police joined the coast guard, marine volunteers, and a police helicopter on Sunday in a bid to find the missing man.
Anyone who sees the kayak or who has information should call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
