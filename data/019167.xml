Buckley: 'It was a perfect tackle'
Nathan Buckley asks the question what else was Brodie Grundy supposed to do

NORTH Melbourne forward Ben Brown has been discharged from hospital.

He spent Saturday night at Epworth hospital under observation after he was concussed in a tackle from Magpies Brodie Grundy during the second quarter of the loss to Collingwood.

But has been given the all clear and was released on Sunday morning.

The Roos spearhead is now resting at home and will be monitored by club doctors throughout the week.

Collingwood coach Nathan Buckley said post-match, "It was a perfect tackle.

"I don't think there was any malice in the tackle. He was tackling to dispossess, tackling to get the free kick the way the rules are written. So what more do you do?"

North coach Brads Scott disagreed with Buckley's assessment, but added, "I don't think there is anything malicious in (Grundy's tackle), and I didn't think there was anything malicious in Patrick Dangerfield's tackle on Kreuzer. It's just unfortunate," he said.

"Accidents happen and we have to make sure we make the game as safe as possible, while still making sure it's a competitive, combative sport."
