  <title>Police scouring bushland for body of NSW schoolgirl Quanne Diec</title>
  <content>
Police will again scour bushland south of Sydney for the remains of murdered schoolgirl Quanne Diec.
It is alleged the 12-year-old was abducted just a few hundred metres from her Granville home as she made her way to school on the morning of Monday, July 27, 1998.
It's believed at some point over the next 12-and-a-half hours Quanne's kidnapper inflicted on her "a substantial injury" that ended her young life.
On Monday morning police announced a new three-day search search for the 12-year-old's remains in bushland off Appin Road at Cataract.
In November last year a 49-year-old man accused of murdering the schoolgirl led police to an area of dense bush in Bulli Tops, near Wollongong, where Quanne's body is believed to be buried, but her body was not found.
