  <title>Music Scene with Glenn Haworth</title>
  <content>
Brand new star: Illawarra 15-year-old Kora Naughton has a bright future in country music after graduating from the Country Music Academy.
Fifteen-year-old Kora Naughton picked up a guitar just over two years ago and taught herself how to play and write songs, but it wasn't until she attended the Tamworth Country Music Festival in January this year that she decided to take her music career more seriously.

Glenn Haworth
Kora applied and was accepted at the CMAA Junior Country Music Academy and began intensive guitar and vocal training with Rod Motby and Kyra Pastrovic respectively through the Haworth Music School Program.
She graduated from the Country Music Academy in July and was a finalist in the "Brand New Star" competition on the Central Coast. Kora has had the opportunity to play with Bill Chambers, has opened before Amber Lawrence and Simply Bushed at the Homes for Heroes charity fund-raiser and played at the Sir Ivan Fire Benefit in Dunedoo.
She has been invited to play at the Nellijam Winter Breaker Country Party in Nelligen on September 9 and at the Crooked River Winery Spring Festival on September 10.
Kora can often be found performing at the Albion Park Hotel and Little Joe's Kitchen & Bar in Dapto. You can download her new single Wrong  on iTunes and Spotify under Kora Naughton Music.
Glenn Haworth runs Haworth's Music Centres in Shellharbour and Fairy Meadow specialising in musical instrument sales, repairs and tuition. For more information visit
