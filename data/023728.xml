  <title>Avalanche threat: Tourists warned to steer clear of remote Alpine areas</title>
  <content>
Heavy snowfall has sparked avalanches in the Victorian Alpine region, with emergency services issuing a stern warning to tourists to steer clear of remote areas.

Vic Emergency said warmer weather and strong winds heightened the risk of avalanches. 
"You should avoid activities such as skiing, snowboarding, or hiking in remote areas of the Alps as there is an increased risk of avalanches," the organisation's advice message said.
The safest area for skiing and winter activities was within the patrolled resort areas, it said. 
Drivers in the state's Alpine region are being urged to stay on main roads and keep an eye out for road closures.

Experienced skiers and snowboarders are also being warned that avalanches in remote areas are highly likely on snow covered steep slopes.
The weather conditions have also prompted a message from the Mountain Sports Collective warning tourists about the high risk of unstable snow on isolated terrain.

Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Richard Carlyon said Monday's wild weather was associated with the back end of a cold front, which sparked a severe weather warning for half of the state on Saturday night and is continuing to cause damage in South Australia.
The front brought rain in some areas (7 millimetres in Cranbourne and 10 millimetres on Phillip Island) and strong wind gusts (39km/h in Melbourne at 8.30am and 56km/h at Avalon at 10.07am).
Conditions will improve in the next couple of days before another cold front blasts Victoria at the end of the week.
The cold weather has resulted in a bumper snowfall for Victoria's slopes, with 80 centimetres of fresh powder falling on Mount Hotham at the weekend.
"Across the region we had 60 to 90 centimetres, which is, for our ski fields, a large number," Mr Carlyon said.
Monday's cold front was expected to bring another 10 to 15 centimetres of snow, much of which had fallen by midday.
Tuesday will be mostly fine and 15 degrees and Wednesday mostly fine and 16 degrees.
The wind will return on Thursday, bringing with it more showers and another milder drop in temperature.

All ski resorts remain open.
