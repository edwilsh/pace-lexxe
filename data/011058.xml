  <content>
Sydney, Aug 3, 2017 AEST (ABN Newswire) - Last year some of the Best 'Investment Desirability' stocks in their sectors were AMC, BAP, CSL, GMG, IAG, SEK, TPM and WBC, but which stocks will be the best for 'Investment Desirability' in 2017? Fund managers are able to vote now at the link below to determine this year's winners. Voting will be closing down asap.

Respondents will receive complimentary tickets to the Awards Night and special offers from Boardroom.media. Boardroom.media will livestream this event for the first time ever to a global audience.
Rebecca Thompson joins East Coles as a member of the Advisory Board, greatly enhancing East Coles' value proposition for both buy and sell-side contacts and corporate clients. Rebecca brings a wealth of markets experience to the East Coles team, having worked in equities research and corporate access at prominent global investment banks such as Citi and JP Morgan. Rebecca was Head of Corporate Affairs and Investor Relations at an S&P/ASX100 company, and has held financial markets roles at prominent firms such as KPMG and Dow Jones Newswires.
The 2017 East Coles / Boardroom.media Corporate Performance Awards Night will be held at the Ivy Ballroom on Thursday, 21 September. The incredibly talented electric violin artist Jane Cho will be performing on the night along with other entertainment. All proceeds f r om the event will go to Transplant Australia. This prestigious annual event is voted on by around 60 prominent fund manager organisations across Asia-Pacific.
2017 Top 10 Award nominees for Best Company, CEO, CFO, Board, Growth Prospects, Investment Desirability, ESG etc (not in ranked order) will be released throughout August & September in the lead-up to the Awards Night.
The East Coles Corporate Performance Research asks analysts f r om both fund managers and brokerage houses to score the S&P/ASX200 stocks they cover across 25 performance categories. The scores are then averaged to create league tables. The idea of the Research is to provide a feedback mechanism between the investment community and the S&P/ASX200 to enhance market efficiency.
