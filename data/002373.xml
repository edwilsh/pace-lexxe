LONDON - Economist and author Noreena Hertz is leaving ITV News after little more than a year to launch a show on US radio network SiriusXM.

Hertz handed in her resignation at ITV News on Monday morning and will launch her show, "MegaHertz: London Calling," on SiriusXM's Insight channel on August 28. Hertz will also act as SiriusXM's chief Europe correspondent, providing analysis for all of its talk radio stations.
