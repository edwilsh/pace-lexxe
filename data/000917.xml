  <title>Cutest cats of the Sunshine Coast revealed</title>
  <content>
WE PUT the call out to our readers to find the Sunshine Coast's cutest cats.

Hundreds of kitties entered so we've selected our eight favourite felines on the Coast - but did yours make the cut?

Check out our office favourites below.

TOOTIE

Daily reader Chynnay Erin shared the story of her car Tootie.

"She was dumped in the bush near my old house six years ago," she said.

Chynnay started feeding the cat, who ended up moving into the house and eventually moving to a new house with Chynnay.

"She's been with us ever since," she said.

CASPER

Casper is one impressive cat. He can high five and comes when you whistle.

CATS OF THE COAST: Casper loves a cuddle.Contributed

Owner Maria Coulter classified her kitty as "totally kissable"... and we agree.

"He is constantly meowing and talking to us," Ms Coulter said.

"He loves a cuddle and a snuggle as you can see."

NUGGET

Nugget is an adventurer. He's a little guardian to his owner Kristina Gorogh.

CATS OF THE COAST: Nugget likes to explore the Coast on his leash.Contributed

Nugget is strictly an indoor cat but Ms Gorogh said she makes sure that he gets time outside without impacting on the Coast's wildlife... responsible cat ownership has never looked cuter.

FRANKIE
CATS OF THE COAST: Frankie loves eating... don't we all.Contributed

Frankie's owner Jessie Bettega said her cat is a bit chunky and food obsessed - but frankly, Frankie, who isn't?

"He'll do anything for an extra biscuit or piece of meat," Ms Bettega said.

"I love him because he loves to have a chat when he sees you and likes to sit at the table when it's time for dinner."

MISO

Miso might look like your average cat, but this friendly feline has been a rock for owner Georgia Snow.

CATS OF THE COAST: Miso the kitty is a real cutie.

"Gotten me through some of the toughest times of my life with her unconditional love and warm cuddles," Ms Snow said.

"(She's) my whole world."

RUPERT

Any cat wearing a jumper is a good cat in our books.

CATS OF THE COAST: Rupert's owners say that he is hyperactive.Contributed

Owner Jac Everett-Mars said Rupert was a special boy because he had a hyperactive disorder.

"We wouldn't have him any other way," Jac said.

SOCKET

Socket has not one but two families on the Sunshine Coast.

Owner Anita Humphreys said he spends time with two families that live a few streets apart.

CATS OF THE COAST: Socket makes everyone smile.Contributed

"(He) spreads his love around with both his families," Antia said.

On top of spending time with his two families, Socket also visits the residents at Opal Aged Care in Kawana.

DWAINE

Dwaine is 85% blind but that doesn't stop him from living his best life.

CATS OF THE COAST: Dwaine is blind, but that doesn't stop him from being cool.Contributed

"Dwaine was dumped and found at only a few days old," his owner Hannah Halstad told the Daily.

"He has so much love to give even though humans have given him a rough start to life.

"He puts a smile on my face everyday and has certainly rescued me as (much as) I have rescued him."
