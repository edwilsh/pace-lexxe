  <content>
Customers who ordered a Model 3 can expect deliveries to begin in late fall.

Tesla said in its second-quarter  that deliveries to non-employees will occur in the fourth-quarter. International buyers shouldn't expect deliveries to begin until late 2018, starting with left-hand drive markets.

Tesla delivered on Friday its first 30 Model 3 vehicles to employees at a handover party at its factory in Fremont, California.

Tesla said it is receiving 1,800 net orders for the Model 3 per day since Friday, the highlighting huge demand for the company's first mass-market vehicle. Tesla said the vehicle is sold out until at least mid-2018 for customers who order today.
