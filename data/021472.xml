  <title>NSW man charged over 'acid' damage to cars</title>
  <content>
A Sydney man has been charged with using an "acid-like" substance to damage more than a dozen cars at Macquarie University in the city's northwest.
The cars were targeted at the university's car parks and a nearby shopping centre between February and June and users on a Chinese-language forum speculated the attacks may have been racially motivated.
The 53-year-old man was charged with 16 counts of malicious damage on Friday and bailed to appear in Burwood Local Court on August 21.
