  <title>Whistleblower laws flagged for debate</title>
  <content>
Greater protections for public sector whistleblowers are set to be put in law in the coming parliamentary session.
In November last year, the Turnbull government reached a deal with the Nick Xenophon Team to extend whistleblower protections to public servants.
An inquiry into the proposed laws, which have been scheduled for the spring sittings, has heard many public servants fear reprisal for disclosing possible wrongdoing despite existing laws.
