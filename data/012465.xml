  <title>Royal Adelaide Hospital radiologist told rostering before stroke deaths 'not satisfactory'</title>
  <content>
The head of radiology at the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) has come under fire from the state's coroner for an unsatisfactory and "casual" attitude to rostering doctors needed to perform life-saving procedures.
Coroner Mark Johns is investigating the deaths of Michael John Russell, 60, and Leslie John Graham, 87, who arrived at the RAH on the same day in April requiring emergency treatment after suffering strokes.
The inquest heard the acting head of radiology at the RAH, Dr Jim Buckley, had granted leave for both of the hospital's interventional neuro-radiologists (INRs).
Dr Rebecca Scroop was overseas at the time and Dr James Taylor was fishing near Victor Harbor, about 85 kilometres south of Adelaide.
The court heard it was "purely fortuitous" that an INR from Flinders Medical Centre, Dr Steve Chryssidis, was available to perform the emergency treatment.
However, there were complications and both patients later died.
The staffing error became apparent in March but the court heard Dr Buckley, who was in charge of rostering, had left it up to Dr Scroop to find another doctor to fill the gap.
Mr Johns said Dr Buckley should have made the arrangements himself.
"Surely something as crucial as this isn't the stuff for informal conversations between staff who don't have the ultimate responsibility for setting of the roster - that's your responsibility," he said.
"It's just not satisfactory on any level, clearly, to leave it to two staff members.
"It wouldn't be acceptable in any other organisation, let alone one that provides a stroke service, surely."
Mr Johns said Dr Buckley's approach was "way too casual".
"This is a very casual approach to administration, that's my view on the matter," he said, but added he would give Dr Buckley "the opportunity to persuade me otherwise".
Doctor concedes he 'should have gone further'

Dr Buckley said there was a "misinterpretation" because he believed Dr Scroop had arranged for Dr Mike Wilks to be available.
"I probably should have gone further but I thought I was being reasonably diligent by asking [Dr Scroop]... I put my trust in her," he said.
Dr Buckley admitted he should have spoken to Dr Wilks himself to ensure everything was in order.
"I thought we had a satisfactory cover in place," he said.
The inquest heard that, when Mr Graham arrived at the RAH requiring treatment, there was a breakdown in communication between administration and the INR team.
The court was told Dr Taylor was contacted multiple times when he was not the on-call doctor.
