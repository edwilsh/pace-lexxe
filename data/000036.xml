Live: Rush Hour
Good morning! It's been alleged the two father-and-son teams arrested in terror raids in Sydney over the weekend were planning to hide a homemade bomb inside a meat mincer. Drivers are warned to take care on Melbourne's EastLink Freeway following a crash early this morning, and passengers should arrive early and expect delays at security at airports around the nation.

Royals had no sex for "seven years"
Prince Charles and Princess Diana didn't have sex for seven years, according to a new program on Britain's Channel 4, which lays bear the couple's marital dysfunction.
The program draws on taped sessions between Diana and her voice coach, claiming Charles was "all over Diana like a bad rash" when they first started dating, but it wasn't long before their sex life fizzled out altogether.
The Princess worked with Peter Settelen for two years in the early nineties to help improve her public speaking voice, and their appointments became a safe place for her to vent her anxieties and frustrations.
The show "Diana: In Her Own Words", reveals Charles told her he had a right to a mistress, that when Diana begged the Queen for marriage advice she was simply told "Charles is hopeless", and that she fantasised about running away with her bodyguard.
6:30am
Passengers face nationwide delays
Airport security has been drastically ramped up following terror raids in Sydney over the weekend, with passengers are warned to expect long delays.
Thousands across the country have been hit with enhanced screening processes, including more ID checks and increased cabin and checked baggage inspections.
Teams of sniffer dogs will also be on hand.
Domestic travellers have been warned to arrive two hours before their flight; international three hours early.
"(Passengers) should limit the amount of carry-on and checked baggage so far as possible, as this will help to ensure that security screening is efficient," Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said when he announced the enhanced security.

Crash on Melbourne's EastLink
Melbourne drivers are warning to allow extra time on their commute this morning, following a crash on EastLink.
Southbound traffic has been affected, with two trucks and a car blocking the ramps onto the Monash Freeway at Dandenong North.
Drivers are advised to take the earlier exit onto Wellington Road.
5:45am
Sydney meat mincer bomb plan
Two father-and-son teams are allegedly behind a plot to blow up an international flight out of Sydney with a homemade bomb disguised as a meat mincer.
Until last week the four men were totally unknown to the nation's counter-terrorism authorities, with only one conviction for negligent driving between them.
But that all changed when police picked up a "small piece of intelligence" about the possible "Islamist-inspired" plot to use a crude explosive device.
It is believed the plot involved smuggling the bomb onto a flight bound for the Middle East, possibly Dubai, hidden in carry-on luggage.
Police arrested them Saturday due to the risk to public safety.
Five homes were raided across the city.
