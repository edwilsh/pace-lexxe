  <title>Cricket Australia reaches pay deal with players' association after bitter standoff</title>
  <content>
A pay deal has been reached between Cricket Australia (CA) and the Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA), the ABC understands, as the parties call a press conference for later this afternoon.
"Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland will join Australian Cricketers' Association CEO Alistair Nicholson to make an announcement on the Memorandum of Understanding between the two parties," a statement said.
The media conference is scheduled for 4:30pm at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
The ABC understands the deal includes a version of a revenue share model the players were fighting hard to keep.
More to come.
