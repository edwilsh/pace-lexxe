  <title>MLA records $3.29 quarterly revenue</title>
  <content>
Medical Australia recorded total revenue for the quarter of $3.29m which is a 5.5% increase over the previous year and 2.2% up on the prior quarter.
This increase has been achieved in spite of the loss of the CareFusion OEM business that took effect after May. The company ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.55m.
The TUTA range continued its strong performance, recording 6.4% growth over the same period last year and 5.5% growth from the previous quarter.
