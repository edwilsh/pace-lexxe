  <title>Households in housing need tipped to rise</title>
  <content>
Almost 15 per cent of Australian households either require public and community housing or need some form of assistance to make their rental housing affordable, new research shows.
The research found 1.3 million households are either unable to access the ownership or rental markets or spend such a significant part of their income on rent that they require some form of assistance to avoid financial stress.
The Curtin University and the University of Adelaide researchers say housing need is set to rise in most states and territories by 2025 and will reach 1.7 million Australia-wide, showing the scale of affordable housing that will be necessary.
