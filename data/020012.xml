A DIRT bike rider has suffered serious injuries after a crash in bushland at Wallsend on Sunday.
A spokesman for the Hunter's Westpac Rescue Helicopter Service said they were called to a section of bush off the Newcastle Link Road about 12.40pm.
A doctor and paramedic were winched down into the crash site and the helicopter has landed on a nearby roundabout. 
The Westpac spokesman said the latest information was the man had been 'seriously injured' in the crash. 
Emergency services are still on scene.
More to come.
