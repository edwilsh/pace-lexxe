BRITISH rock giants Muse will continue chasing summer around the world with two surprise concerts in Australia in December.
While the band rarely tour ahead of a new album, they have been on the road for the Northern Hemisphere summer with a run of concerts at festivals, including this week's Lollapalooza in Chicago and the Reading festival in the UK later this month
The Supermassive Black Hole supergroup, who have reached the top of the charts in Australia with their last four albums, are wildly popular here and recognised as one of the world's most dynamic live acts.

They will perform at Qudos Bank Arena on December 16 and Rod Laver Arena on December 18 with general tickets on sale on December 10, with a Frontier Touring Members pre-sale from Monday.
Music fans will enjoy a raft of superstar tours in December with concerts from Sia, Paul McCartney, Culture Club, Shawn Mendes, The Weeknd, J. Cole, Yusuf/Cat Stevens and the 80s nostalgia extravaganza of K.C. and the Sunshine Band, Village People and Sister Sledge.
The trio of Matt Bellamy, Dominic Howard and Chris Wolstenholme are currently working on a new record which will be released in 2018.

The band gave fans a taste of the record with the single Dig Down in May with an AI-generated lyric video which was updated daily for a month with new images and video footage.
Their love affair with Australian audiences began with their debut album Showbiz in 1999 and the band were regular tourists here, often commanding the main stages of the Big Day Out festival.

Frontman Bellamy has a six-year-old son Bing with actor Kate Hudson. The pair were in a relationship for four years before calling off their engagement.

With only two concerts in Australia on this leg, it is likely the band will return for a bigger national tour after they release the new album next year.
