  <title>Osprey Medical in halt as Bells, Canaccord ready raising</title>
  <content>
﻿ASX-listed health technology company Osprey Medical is seeking a $32.5 million equity injection via Bell Potter Securities and Canaccord Genuty. 
According to terms sent to potential investors on Wednesday morning, the company is looking to raise $22.2 million via the placement of new CDIs and another $10.3 million in a non-renounceable rights issue. 
The new CDIs were being sold for 40¢ each, which was an 8 per cent discount to the last close and a 12.9 per cent discount to the 30 day volume weighted average price. 
Funds raised were to expand the company's US sales force and initiate a pilot European sales program in Germany, according to the terms. 

The brokers were calling for bis into the placement by 10am on Thursday. 

The entitlement offer was scheduled to open on August 14 and close on August 25. 
Osprey Medical would have a $147.5 million market capitalisation following the raising. 
The company's ASX-listed securities went into a trading halt on Wednesday morning.
