  <title>Two men charged over Sydney terror plot 'to bring down plane'</title>
  <content>
Two men have been charged with planning a terrorist act after police uncovered an alleged Sydney-based plot to bring down a plane.

Both men are scheduled to appear in Parramatta Court on Friday morning. The maximum penalty each could face is life imprisonment.
Khaled Merhi remains in custody, while a fourth man, 50, was released without charge on Tuesday night.

The men had been arrested in dramatic raids across Sydney on Saturday night, where several items were allegedly seized.
"The NSW Joint Counter Terrorism Team (JCTT) has charged two men in Sydney this evening with terrorism offences," the federal police statement said.

"One man remains in police custody under 'specified time' provisions outlined in Section 23DD of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). This legislation recognises that terrorism investigations are inherently complex and that there can be legitimate reasons for extended periods of detention for suspects in such matters.
"Police have conducted six premises searches across Sydney this week, including in the suburbs of Lakemba, Punchbowl (two locations), Surry Hills, Wiley Park and Bankstown.
"This investigation remains ongoing, and further information will be provided at a media conference tomorrow morning."
Members of the public were urged to report "any suspicious activity" to the National Security Hotline on 1800 123 400.
Security measures at Australia's major airports were heightened last week after police received information about the alleged bomb threat.
The move prompted lengthy passenger queues that snaked outside terminal doors as travellers were urged to arrive hours before their flights.
However, following advice from ASIO that there was no longer an active threat to the aviation industry, some security measures would be eased, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Thursday.
"There will be continued enhanced security measures. Some of them will be visible to travellers, some of them will not," Mr Turnbull said.
