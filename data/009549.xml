  <title>Peter O'Neill voted in as PNG Prime Minister for another term</title>
  <content>
Peter O'Neill has been elected as the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea's 10th Parliament, by 60 votes to 46.
It comes after the election of the speaker, Job Pomat, also from the coalition led by Peter O'Neill's People's National Congress party.
Mr O'Neill was then sworn in by Governor General Sir Bob Dadae.
Bruce Hill spoke to Bal Kama, a PhD student at the Australia National University and a sessional lecturer at the University of Canberra Faculty of Business, Government and Law, just moments after the announcement.
He says the people still expect Mr O'Neill to answer for the problems of the previous government.
