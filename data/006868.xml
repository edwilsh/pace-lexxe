  <title>Vegemite may actually improve your mood</title>
  <content>
WE all know the 'happy little Vegemite' jingle - but what you may not know is the popular spread most Aussies have in their cupboard actually improves the mood. 

Researchers from Victoria University have discovered those who consume yeast-based spreads including Vegemite and  Promite are less stressed and anxious.  

In , scientists from the university said a deficiency in vitamin B - which we all know vegemite is rich in - was linked with a range of conditions including depression and anxiety. 

An online survey of more than 500 people in three countries, including Australia, revealed those who eat more yeast-based spreads had improved moods. 

We'd like to know what you think. Are you happier for eating vegemite and other yeast spreads? Join the discussion and tell us below.
