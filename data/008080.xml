  <title>APN Outdoor's CEO steps down</title>
  <content>
Billboard advertiser APN Outdoor is searching for a new chief executive after Richard Herring decided to step down at the end of September.
Mr Herring has been CEO since 2004, and said the time is right for him to step down given the company's strong management team and bright future.
Chairman Doug Flynn commended Mr Herring for overseeing the growth of the company, which owns more than 50,000 outdoor advertising panels in Australia and New Zealand.
Mr Flynn also noted Mr Herring's management of the company's ASX listing in 2014, which followed APN News and Media's sale of the company to private equity.
APN Outdoor said its board has begun a search for Mr Herring's replacement, and will consider internal and external candidates.
Chief financial officer Wayne Castle will act as interim chief executive if a transition period is required.
APN Outdoor shares were up seven cents at $4.69 at 1305 AEST.
