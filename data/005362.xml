A Canberra prisoner who escaped custody on Saturday after being admitted to hospital has been recaptured, after police spotted him in regional NSW.
Jonathon Hogan, 23, had appeared in the ACT Magistrates Court on Saturday morning on charges relating to property offences and resisting police.
He was then transferred to Canberra Hospital where he was .
Police in NSW said they suspected Hogan may have headed to Dubbo in the state's central-west.
It is understood Hogan had tried to evade police before, having led them on a chase through a shopping mall five years ago.
Officers chased a man they believed to be Hogan at Cowra, in New South Wales, this morning, and Hogan was arrested at Boorowa, about 70km away this afternoon.
ACT police said members of the public reported sightings of Hogan, which contributed to his arrest.
Police did not say whether he would be extradited to the ACT, or whether he would face extra charges.
