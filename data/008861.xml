  <title>Genie the calf: dead ringer of KISS rocker</title>
  <content>
KISS frontman Gene Simmons is udderly thrilled by a newborn calf born with strikingly similar black-and-white markings to the face paint he wears on stage.
Simmons tweeted his admiration for the calf on Sunday, saying, "This is real, folks!!!"
The calf was born on Friday at a ranch near Kerrville in Texas, which is about 96km northwest of San Antonio.
Heather Taccetta, who lives at the ranch with her family, said the calf belongs to her grandmother. It's named Genie, in honour of Simmons.
Taccetta says the calf and its mother are doing fine and that Genie is a family favorite and won't be sold for slaughter.
