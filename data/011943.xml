  <title>Coroner critical of handling of strokes</title>
  <content>
The South Australian coroner has criticised the "casual" approach to health administration that contributed to a rostering bungle that hindered the treatment of two patients who died of strokes at the Royal Adelaide Hospital.
Coroner Mark Johns has heard that the hospital's two clot-busting specialists were on leave at the same time and there was a mix-up over what arrangements had been made to cover for them,
"It's just a way too casual approach to take," Mr Johns said on Thursday as he continued an inquest into the two deaths.
