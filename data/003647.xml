  <title>More must be done to stop sex assaults: Universities Australia</title>
  <content>
Universities want to send a clear message sexual assault and harassment is not acceptable and all students have the right to a safe and respectful culture.

14 MINS AGO  UPDATED 4 MINS AGO

Universities have acknowledged they have to do more to protect students from sexual assault and harassment.

A landmark national survey of sexual assault and harassment among students, released by the Human Rights Commission on Tuesday, shows it's widespread.

Universities Australia says institutions around the country share a commitment to do more and do better to ensure every student is safe and can study in an environment where respect is paramount.

"We send a strong and clear message today that these behaviours are not acceptable. Not on our campuses and not in Australia society," chair Margaret Gardner said.

"This report tells us that, while much has already been done, we have more work to do to prevent sexual assault and sexual harassment in student communities."

The peak body has released a 10-point plan for national initiatives to combat assaults and harassment and many individual universities have also launched their own measures.

The national response includes developing a respectful relationships education program tailored for university students and providing specialist training to academic and student residence staff about how to respond effectively and compassionately when someone tells them about an incident.

There's also a 24-hour support line to give students access to specialist counsellors from Rape and Domestic Violence Services Australia.

Universities will commission a follow-up survey to see whether they're making progress in combating the problem.

Professor Gardner said the initiatives signalled the sector's resolve to ensure students could study and live in a safe and respectful culture and those who report unacceptable behaviour received the right response.

"This is our contribution to an important, ongoing national conversation about how we prevent and address sexual harassment and sexual assault within Australian society," she said.

She thanked the more than 30,000 students who took part in the survey, particularly victims and survivors who shared their stories.

"We have listened - and we will act."
