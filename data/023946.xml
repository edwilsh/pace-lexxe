  <title>Bullseye win for Victoria</title>
  <content>
VICTORIA had a bullseye run to win this year's Australian Darts Championships in Townsville.
A field of almost 500 participants and supporters took part in the 10-day long championships, which organisers say injected nearly $1 million into Townsville's economy.
Victorian pair Justin Thompson and Tori Kewish were crowned men's and women's champions respectively, with Thompson scoring his first national title and Kewish winning at the young age of 21.
The pair also combined forces to beat Queensland duo Andrew Townes and Chrissy Sheerin in the mixed pairs division.
Queensland did score a major win thanks to Townes, who won the World Ranked Pacific Masters, and was rewarded with selection in the Australian team alongside fellow Queenslander to play at the World Darts Federation World Cup in Japan.
Victoria's championship win was its second in five years.
"It was an outstanding success, the standard of darts was very high," Darts Australia president Graham Roberts.
"Victoria always brings a strong team and they have some great players coming through, but the other states were very competitive.
"Queensland were pretty strong in the team events and it's good to see a couple of their players made the Australian team.
"We were also very impressed with the venue, and the support we received from the Townsville community was second to none."
Western Australia dominated the team event in both ladies and men's events, while in the Pater Mac Tournament Victoria were too good as they dismantled their opponents in one-sided finals.
Kewish and partner Janine Cassar won the ladies pairs while South Australian World Dart Trophy Champion Peter Machin and partner Aaron Morrison won the men's pairs.
