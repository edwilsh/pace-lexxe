A Yuncheng City salt lake in China's Sanxi Province is covered with white foam that looks like snow in the middle of the summer.

While scientists don't know for sure what causes all the foam, experts think it's a result of a unique mixture of algae and plankton in the salty water.

Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences also think a recent string of windy days in the region combined with high temperatures contributed to the mixture of conditions that created the foam.

Locals are stunned by the peculiar sight and have taken to the lake's shores to photograph the phenomenon.
