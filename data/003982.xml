  <title>US fire department rescues man and his dog</title>
  <content>
Firefighters have come to the rescue of a man and his dog stuck in their SUV in a rapidly rising creek.
The Florence Fire Department in Fremont, California used their truck's ladder to reach the man and his pooch - with a rope used to secure the dog who was then pulled to safety before the owner hauled himself out of harm's way.
Posted to the Fremont County Sheriff's Office Facebook page on Sunday, the video has been shared more than 5,000 times and has been viewed nearly 460,000 times.
According to the post, the man had parked his SUV in a dry creek bed, but it quickly became flooded by severe rain.
The sherrif's office also posted a "Happy ending" picture with the man, his dog - who they identify as "Petey" - and their rescuer, while the stranded SUV can be seen in the background still stuck in the raging flood water.
