  <title>Father accused of pointing pistol at four-year-old daughter, before letting her play with firearm</title>
  <content>
A father has been charged after he was filmed pointing a 45-calibre pistol at his four-year-old daughter, before letting the young girl play with the high-powered weapon.
During their investigation into illegal firearms, police found mobile phone video footage which allegedly shows the man sky-larking with one of the Colt .45 handguns before pointing it at his daughter. The weapon did not discharge.
Officers allege the child is then seen playing with the automatic pistol and pulling the trigger, without effect.
The man was also filmed allegedly pointing the shotgun at the camera.    
"Allowing a child to play with a firearm of any kind is reprehensible and is a serious criminal offence," Assistant Commissioner Mark Murdoch said.
As part of their investigation, police seized a 25-calibre Walther TP-model pistol, two Colt 1911 45-calibre automatic pistols and a Bentley-brand 12-guage shotgun from addresses at Revesby and Granville.
The 32-year-old Revesby man was today charged with six offences, including four counts of illegal firearm possession; allow unauthorised person possess firearm and production/possession of child abuse material (firearm) pursuant to Section 91H of the NSW Crimes Act.
