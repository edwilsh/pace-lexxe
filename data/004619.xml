Police will apply for a fresh apprehended violence order against Salim Mehajer on behalf of his estranged wife Aysha, in the latest court battle for the property developer and former local councillor.
NSW Police confirmed on Tuesday a new application would be made on August 9 in Sutherland Local Court.
Police applied for an interim AVO against Mr Mehajer on behalf of his estranged wife in July last year, less than a year after the couple's lavish wedding in August 2015.
The order prevented Mr Mehajer, the former deputy mayor of the now-defunct Auburn Council, contacting or approaching Ms Mehajer.
She had then reverted to using her maiden name, Learmonth.
At the time of the order the 31-year-old former beautician was a director of a string of Mehajer companies, including SM Engineering and Construction Services and Skypoint Towers Holdings.
SkyPoint Towers is Mr Mehajer's signature project, a 14-storey apartment complex development in John Street, Lidcombe.

Mr Mehajer has previously denied his estranged wife requested the first AVO.
He told media outlets at the time the AVO was prompted after "alleged complaints by neighbours" and because "police seem to have nothing better to do".
Mr Mehajer is facing a string of legal battles in courts across the city, including an electoral fraud trial and a dispute with a liquidator who is seeking to claw back $700,000 for creditors of his failed company SM Project Developments.
The company was wound up in 2013 owing almost $900,000 to the Australian Taxation Office.
Sydney barrister David Stack appeared in the Supreme Court on Tuesday for liquidator Anthony Elkerton of Dean-Willcocks Advisory, who alleges Mr Mehajer entered into "unreasonable director-related transactions" with SM Projects.
Mr Stack told the court Mr Mehajer "substantially [depleted] the accounts of the company" when he had outstanding tax bills of more than $840,000.
"He used monies that were properly payable to the ATO," Mr Stack said.
The three-day hearing continues on Thursday.
