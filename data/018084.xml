  <title>No holiday for hardworking Wallaroos</title>
  <content>
THE Wallaroos have got quickly down to business in Ireland as they prepare for their Rugby World Cup opener against the tournament hosts on Thursday (4am AEST, live on Fox Sports).
The Australians flew out of Sydney on Tuesday and assistant coach Scott Allen said the side had hit the ground running in Dublin ahead of the much-anticipated pool clash at a sold out UCD Bowl.
"Yesterday's session, we actually wondered whether we should run a session," Allen said.
"It's the day after we got off the plane, the girls are a bit jet-lagged yet they came out and did a really good job.
"We were really happy with where we got to yesterday.
"Today we think we've got over the jet lag and we're starting to see the benefits of it.
"We've just about finished downloading the different plays we want to run for our first match, so now we're just getting to the stage where we can actually start executing those plays."
Ireland are ranked fourth in the world, Australia are fifth while the Wallaroos' second group opponents, France, are fourth.
Australia rounds out pool play against 14th ranked Japan.

The 12-team tournament is split into three pools of four.
The top team from each group advances to the semi-finals along with the highest-ranked second-placed side.
"One thing we know is our first two games, Ireland and France, they're both very, very strong at the set-piece," Allen said.
"That's no surprise to anybody and we've got to be ready for that.
"We've got to also have some things of our own, to actually challenge them.
"We try to stick with a basic structure that we've been working on for the last 12 months but we've also added a few new things in which challenges the girls a little bit.
"Today's the first day the girls took over running the lineouts, rather than me calling them.
"So I think we're coming along quite well in that area."

Allen did admit that the Wallaroos had work to do with their scrummaging, after being given a torrid time up front in heavy losses to the world's top three sides - England, New Zealand and Canada - during a recent tour of NZ.
"We did struggle a little bit in the scrum in the Four Nations series earlier this year but we're ready, we're seeing some improvements," Allen said.
"I think we're positive in that regard.
"What we're trying to emphasise to the girls is we've got to be ready to adapt and focus on us.
"Get what we're doing right and then we should be able to handle anything that comes out of the ordinary.
"Hopefully we've given the girls enough skills and improved their decision making so they can adapt to it.
"Obviously we're playing at the highest level so the level of detail that's involved and the work we're putting in - it's certainly no holiday, we're not going to be seeing many of the sights.
"But that's not what we're here for, we're here to compete very strongly against every nation we play."
