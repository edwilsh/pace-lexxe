  <title>Cleanaway charged over Vic death</title>
  <content>
A waste management company is facing federal workplace charges after a woman was hit and killed by a recycling truck at a Melbourne factory two years ago.
A 56-year-old woman who was working at the Ford Assembly Plant in Campbellfield was killed when she was hit by a Cleanaway recycling truck that was picking up a skip bin at the factory in August 2015.
The Commonwealth DPP on Wednesday confirmed the charges which allege failures involving traffic management, risk assessment and control measures which could lead to combined fines of up to $4.5 million.
