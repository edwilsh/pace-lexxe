Billionaire James Packer has formally returned to the board of casinos operator Crown Resorts, just over 18 months since he stood down to focus on the casino operator's development projects.
Mr Packer is the company's biggest shareholder, and was appointed to the board on Thursday after the move received all necessary consents and approvals in May.
Crown has also appointed Guy Jalland, a corporate lawyer and the chief executive of Mr Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings, to the board.
