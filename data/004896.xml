  <title>Traffic slows after car and motorbike collide on Coast road</title>
  <content>
BREAKING: A MAN in his 50s is being treated for a leg injury after a car and motorbike collided in Cooroibah this afternoon.
Ambulance crews were called to Coral Fern Dr and McKinnon Dr at 3.11pm and a critical care paramedic is on scene.
It's believed the patient, who is also suffering neck and back pain, is the motorbike rider - but this is yet to be confirmed.
Traffic updates indicate lanes are blocked and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
More to come.
