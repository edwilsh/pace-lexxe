  <title>Fonua-Blake facing ban, Edwards cops fine</title>
  <content>
MANLY forward Addin Fonua-Blake has received a one-match NRL ban for a high shot on Melbourne star Cooper Cronk.
Fonua-Blake will miss Sunday's clash with the Sydney Roosters if he pleads guilty to a careless high tackle charge, but will risk a two-match ban if he contests it.
Fonua-Blake felled Cronk with the tackle in the first half of the Storm's 40-6 win in Melbourne on Sunday.
The bench prop's absence would be a blow to a seventh-placed Sea Eagles side aiming to avoid their third-straight loss.
Meanwhile, polarising Eels forward .
Lying on the ground after copping a high shot, Pearson was defenceless as Edwards dropped on him with a cocked arm.
Despite calls for a harsher penalty, Edwards was charged with grade one contrary conduct and copped an $1100 fine after taking the early guilty plea.
