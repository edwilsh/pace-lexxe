  <title>Trigger's big shot</title>
  <content>
MEET AN NBA LEGEND
THE legend that is Patty Mills is on his way back to Cairns.
After being in town last month, he has been around Australia promoting his book but he is back next week.
Cairns Regional Council will host the NBA point guard for a "Meet basketball champ Patty Mills" event this coming Monday from 6-8.30pm at the Cairns Esplanade.
Get down and see the legend before he starts training camp ahead of the coming NBA season.
STATTMANN SCOUTED
OUR spies tell us there was a Virginia Tech representative at the Fish Tank on Friday evening to watch youngster Kody Stattmann.
The big-time school plays in the Atlantic Coast Conference and the scout was getting all the inside knowledge from Snakes coach Aaron Fearne.
Dell Curry, dad of NBA star Steph, is one of the biggest names to come out of Virginia Tech.
TRIGGER'S BIG SHOT
OUR man Cameron Tragardh must have impressed the bosses in his first year as a Fox Sports special comments man.
The Trigger man is set to have an upgrade during the 2017-18 NBL season as he has been given all the Taipans and Brisbane Bullets home games to call - twice as many as he got last year.
Congratulations to the Mackay player-coach as he certainly put in the hard yards last year preparing to be a colour commentator and did a super job of it.
Unlike others in the role, Trigger likes to have a bit of fun and not talk about his own career, which is what the fans want to hear at home.
PHOENIX BOUNCE BACK
CREDIT where it's due. We made a bit of fun of the Sunshine Coast Phoenix and Cairns junior Jeromie Hill last week for blowing a big lead.
They have bounced back, knocking over Rockhampton in overtime with Hill dropping 29 points and nine rebounds.
WATTS TOP BLOKE WHO'LL BE MISSED
FAREWELL to basketball nut and all-round good bloke Duncan Watts.
Watts was the Cairns Taipans media manager before taking a year's parental leave. He has decided not to return to the Snakes' front office and to continue to look after his daughter.
He will be sorely missed and we wish him all the best in his future endeavours.
