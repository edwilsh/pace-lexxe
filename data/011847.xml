  <title>Man freed after Melbourne plane crash</title>
  <content>
A trainee pilot and instructor have been seriously injured when their light plane ditched into a paddock southeast of Melbourne.
Ambulance Victoria says the aircraft crashed at Clyde North about 10.40am on Thursday, with one person flown to Royal Melbourne Hospital in a critical condition.
A man believed to be in his 20s was freed from the two-seater training plane and taken to The Alfred Hospital with facial, chest and spinal injuries in a serious but stable condition.
Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman Peter Gibson says the ultralight, two-seater plane was on a training flight when it crashed.
"It was on a dual training flight with an instructor and a student on board," Mr Gibson said.
The plane broadcast a mayday message before crashing into a paddock on Hardys Road, the CASA spokesman said.
The aircraft was registered to the Learn to Fly Melbourne school based at Moorabbin Airport.
Police and firefighters remain at the crash site.
