  <title>AFL laws committee to discuss tackling at meeting next month after Brodie Grundy and Patrick Dangerfield incidents</title>
  <content>
Tackling is set to return to the agenda when the AFL's Laws of the Game committee meets next month after a the issue reached another flashpoint on Saturday night.
Less than a week after Brownlow medal fancy Patrick Dangerfield was suspended for a dangerous tackle on Carlton's Matthew Kreuzer, star North Melbourne forward Ben Brown was taken to hospital after being concussed as his head planted into the Etihad Stadium turf in a tackle from Collingwood ruckman Brodie Grundy during the Kangaroos' 54-point loss to the Magpies.

Brown carted off after Grundy tackle

After his head sickeningly slammed into the ground in a tackle from Collingwood ruckman Brodie Grundy, star North Melbourne forward Ben Brown was carted off Etihad Stadium.

Brown was released from hospital at around 3am on Sunday morning, later tweeting that he was "feeling good."
Just as occurred with Dangerfield's tackle, . Football legend Leigh Matthews said on Sunday that that Grundy had to be suspended for a match given that was Dangerfield's penalty, while the coaches of the players involved - Collingwood's Nathan Buckley and North's Brad Scott - were at odds when questioned about the incident after the game on Saturday night.

Brown got rid of the ball as he was heading towards the ground, but with Grundy having pinned his arms, the Roo was unable to brace for impact. Yet Grundy won the free kick for holding the ball, with Buckley noting that it highlighted the "massive grey area" of tackling legality.
Buckley said that Grundy had laid the "perfect tackle".

"It was a pretty good tackle rewarded with a holding the ball. Clearly when you're tackling someone from behind with momentum, there's going to be a little bit of carry on," Buckley said.

"It was a perfect tackle. I don't think there was any malice in the tackle. He was tackling to dispossess, tackling to get a free kick. The way the rules are written."
However asked if he agreed with the "perfect tackle" assessment, Scott was clearly bemused, saying "no" and "how" with a bewildered expression before moving on.
The laws committee's next scheduled meeting is in September, and Fairfax Media understands tackling will be an item for discussion. The committee met last month, before thd Dangerfield furore, and it's understood tackling was not discussed.
While there appeared to be subtle differences between the incidents, such as that Dangerfield held onto Kreuzer for longer than after the Blues ruckman had disposed of the ball than Grundy did with Brown, four-time premiership coach Matthews, who sits on the committee, said it was clear Grundy was staring at a suspension, with the match review panel meeting on Monday to assess the weekend's incidents.
"The fact is, if Dangerfield gets a week, Grundy has to get a week ," Matthews said on Channel Seven's AFL Game Day.
"Pin the arms, head hits the ground, that's it. And I agree with that," he said.
While Kreuzer was not knocked out on impact, he was concussed in the incident. The MRP assessed Dangerfield's tackle as careless conduct with medium impact to the head, offering him a one-match penalty with an early guilty plea. The Geelong superstar accepted the penalty despite it ruling him out of contention to win a second straight Brownlow.
Grundy was asked by Channel Seven about the incident on Saturday night, and appeared rattled by what had happened. "There was no malicious intent," Grundy said.
Positively however, Brown tweeted on Sunday morning. "Hi all - quick update: Feeling good this morning! Thanks for all the kind messages of support," Brown said.
Concussion remains a hot topic in AFL circles. On Saturday, St Kilda coach Alan Richardson said there was a chance forward Paddy McCartin mightn't play again this year as he works his way back from a sixth concussion since 2014. Melbourne's Angus Brayshaw impressed however playing with the Demons' VFL affiliate Casey on Saturday, racking up 34 disposals in what was his third game back following a fourth concussion in 12 months.
Brown wasn't the only injury concern on Saturday night. Playing against his old side for the first time, Magpie Daniel Wells exacerbated a pre-existing quad injury, and will be assessed ahead of the Pies' clash against Port Adelaide on Sunday week, while midfielder Levi Greenwood is expected to miss matches with a medial issue in his knee sustained in the second quarter.
Pies Veteran Tyson Goldsack returned to the field after being taken off for a concussion test in the third quarter after a bump from North midfielder Ben Cunnington. The Roo is likely to face MRP attention for the hit.
Meanwhile Buckley reiterated that captain Scott Pendlebury is unlikely to play again this season as he recovers from a broken finger, although young Roo Jy Simpkin is expected to be available to face Hawthorn next Sunday after being a late withdrawal on Saturday night with a rolled ankle.
