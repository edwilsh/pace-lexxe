  <content>
A BRISBANE barrister who claimed the $50,000 in cash that former Ipswich mayor Paul Pisasale was found with at Melbourne airport has been fined for contemptuous comments made to a magistrate.
Sam Di Carlo appeared in the Brisbane Supreme Court yesterday over contempt proceedings brought by the attorney-general in relation to comments he made to magistrate John Costello in January last year.
