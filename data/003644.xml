But sexual assault advocates have condemned the peak body for failing to mention either perpetrators or disciplinary measures in its response. 
"Universities Australia's complete silence on offenders and disciplinary reform makes victim-survivors question just how committed they really are to taking firmer steps towards making campuses safe for students," said End Rape on Campus ambassador Nina Funnell. 
"Implementing trauma-informed reporting channels is all well and good but if universities have no intention of ever disciplining offenders there is little incentive to report." 
University administrators have been awaiting the survey's findings since the survey was launched in November. All 39 institutions are set to release their individual results on Tuesday morning . 
" and "betraying" the students who participated in the survey because they would not release data on individual universities.
The figures are set to have an impact on Australia's third largest export, the $20 billon international student market. 
Donaldson Law director Adair Donaldson said unless universities fundamentally changed their culture of dealing with sexual assault, a wave of victims could come forward seeking damages due to breaches of duty of care.  
"Universities must be prepared to acknowledge and support survivors of sexual assault and abuse, or the result to these academic institutions could be serious financial distress due to legal claims," Mr Donaldson said.
"My experience working with survivors of institutional abuse is that nobody wants to embark on aggressive and protracted legal action, there is an opportunity for the universities to work together with survivors, rather than against them."
