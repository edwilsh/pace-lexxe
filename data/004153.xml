  <title>Stunt goes wrong on Karl's show</title>
  <content>
NOT everything went to plan during the taping of Karl Stefanovic's new TV show, This Time Next Year.

As Nine's Head of Production and Development revealed to news.com.au, $40,000 worth of damage was done to the set when a fiery stunt went wrong.

If you missed last night's premiere episode, here's the premise of the show:

Everyday Aussies sit down on a couch opposite Karl Stefanovic and tell him about "monumental" personal goals that they want to tackle and overcome in the next 12 months. Then they disappear backstage and through the magic of television, it's suddenly a year later and the same people come back onto the stage to reveal if they achieved their goals.

Last night's debut episode featured a 33-year-old office worker named Mel Goh who made the vow, "This time next year I'll be a stuntwoman".

"Presuming Mel was successful, we had always intended that she would perform some sort of stunt when she came back the next year," Nine's Head of Production and Development, Trent Chapman, told news.com.au.

"We looked at all sorts of options for the reveal and somehow the discussion came around to her being on fire."

Mr Chapman said they rehearsed the stunt outside for a month or so prior to filming with a stand-in before testing it out several times indoors and eventually on the stage.

"It was all perfect but then of course in the heat of the moment, so to speak, there was a small problem."

On the actual night of filming, Mel Goh walked out onto the stage covered in flames and was flanked by two safety officers who eventually doused the flames with extinguishers.

"Some of the foam spray went onto the very, very expensive LED screen at the back [of the stage] and they were ruined," Mr Chapman said.

"I think it was about $40,000 worth of damage. Sorry to our insurers."

Mel Goh's achievement of becoming a qualified stunt person was just one of the many positive stories featured on the show last night.

An overweight couple left Karl Stefanovic  they'd lost over 100kg between them, and a couple from South Australia who had previously had 10 failed rounds of IVF vowed to have a baby within a year. They ended up with twins.

Viewers took to social media to praise the positivity of This Time Next Year with many saying the show had reduced them to tears.
