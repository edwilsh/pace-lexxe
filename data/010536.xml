  <title>Stan series No Activity to get a US adaptation from Will Ferrell's company</title>
  <content>
Australian streaming platform Stan has struck a deal with the US studio CBS which will put a US adaptation of its comedy series No Activity on air in the world's biggest television market.
The US version of No Activity will air on the streaming platform CBS All Access.

Significantly, the US adaptation will import one of its Australian stars: actor Patrick Brammall will reprise his role as Detective Hendy, one of the two cops in the series.
Brammall will also co-produce the US adaptation.

No Activity is largely set in the front seat of a police car on an uneventful stakeout, and focuses on the banter between two cops who periodically check in with their radio operator to advise "no activity".
The project was unveiled at a media presentation in Los Angeles for the platform and its highly anticipated flagship title Star Trek: Discovery. (Star Trek: Discovery will air in Australia on Netflix.)

Gary Sanchez, the production company owned by comedian Will Ferrell, will produce the US adaptation of No Activity alongside the show's Australian production company Jungle.

The series will be produced by Joe Farrell, Jason Burrows, Trent O'Donnell and Brammall.
O'Donnell and Burrows, who both worked on the original series, are now working in the US; O'Donnell works as a director on Brooklyn 99 for Fox while Burrows produces Mr Inbetween for FX.
Stan launched No Activity in 2015; two seasons were produced.
While much of the television business's "format" industry is focused on exporting US formats to other markets, it is still rare to secure a deal which runs in the reverse.
That said, Australian comedies have historically been robust dealmakers, even if many did not eventually bear fruit.
Past Australia-to-US adaptations include Kath & Kim (which was not a hit) and Wilfred (which was).
Jungle's Review with Myles Barlow was also successfully remade for the US as Review with Forrest McNeill.
Other Australia-to-US adaptations include Rake, The Slap, Secrets and Lies and Dangerous Women, which was based on Prisoner.
Stan is a joint venture between Fairfax Media, which publishes this website, and the Nine Network.
