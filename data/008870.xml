The Pinssar diesel particulate matter (DPM) Reader is designed for use in enclosed harsh environments

2nd Aug 2017

Leading technology companies APC Technology & Pinssar partner to launch the

world's first continuous Diesel Particulate Matter Reader.

The Pinssar diesel particulate matter (DPM) Reader is designed for use in enclosed harsh environments

where diesel emission can present a threat to human health and safety.

The Pinssar DPM Reader provides real-time smart monitoring on a continuous basis, rather than spot checking or reacting to

obvious signs post exposure.

Pinssar chose APC Technology as their hardware partner due to their 30+ years of experience in designing, manufacturing and supporting ruggedised equipment.

The collaborative relationship between APC Technology and Pinssar has resulted in the launch of this industry leading solution.

The world's first DPM Reader is suitable for deployment in enclosed environments across a wide range of industries, including mining, defence, oil and gas and transport.
