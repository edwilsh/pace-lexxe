  <title>New social media policy for public servants might be unconstitutional</title>
  <content>
The government's new social media policies for public servants could be unconstitutional, a workplace law expert has told Crikey. Starting today, public servants will be subjected to a policy that goes further than most other policies of its kind, taking in not only public criticism of government policy, but also posting anonymously or under a pseudonym. Even more Orwellian, "liking", sharing, or even failing to delete criticism of the government posted on a public servant's page by other people will be treated as though the public servant had made the disparaging comment.
