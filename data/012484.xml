  <title>'They want to take sunshine away': Illawarra MP against push to shorten daylight saving</title>
  <content>
An Illawarra MP has labelled a National Party push to shorten daylight saving as "a reckless attack" on small businesses and residents.
Daylight saving in NSW currently starts on the first Sunday in October and ends on the first Sunday in April - with clocks wound forward an hour to extend evening daylight.

However, Tweed MP Geoff Provest - whose electorate borders Queensland - wants that period to end a month earlier.
Using a motion in the NSW Parliament, Mr Provest highlighted concerns raised by rural and regional residents who "get up in the dark and come home in the dark".

A decade ago, the length of daylight saving in NSW was extended by six weeks - it previously ran from the last Sunday in October until the last Sunday in March.
Mr Provest said that change was made "without a mandate of the people".
Keira MP Ryan Park hit out at the Nationals' idea, labelling it "short-sightedness".

"They have failed to consider the economic benefits and flow-on employment that thrives during daylight saving," Mr Park said.
