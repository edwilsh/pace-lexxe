  <title>Essendon coach John Worsfold satisfied with Jobe Watson's contribution in 2017</title>
  <content>
John Worsfold maintains a decision on Jobe Watson's playing future will be made during the club's post-season, whenever that happens for Essendon, who are 10th on the ladder and pushing for a finals berth.
In the same week that champion Nick Riewoldt announced his imminent departure from the AFL playing landscape and with West Coast set to lose both Sam Mitchell and Matt Priddis from their playing ranks, the Essendon coach said veteran Watson had played his role for the Bombers this season after returning from a year-long ban.

"We've been pretty happy with his form throughout the year. He hasn't been best on ground every week, but he hasn't been poor," Worsfold said.
"I've been pretty happy with the way Jobe has bounced back to footy this year considering where he's come from. And he's been enjoying his footy, which has been a big thing for us.

"I'll be sitting down with Jobe post-season, and working out where we're at as a club [and] where he's at.
"That decision will be made on the balance of the whole season."
The Essendon coach was also keeping his cards close to his chest on the playing future of fellow veteran Brent Stanton.

"That will be ongoing discussions with Brent and how he's feeling," Worsfold said.
