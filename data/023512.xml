  <title>What could Freo get for Balic?</title>
  <content>
Duffield said while he wasn't doubting Balic's talent, there were "some issues".

"When a kid is homesick and can't see out two years at his club, you have to wonder how much footy means to him, are there other issues in his life that are going to unsettle him?"

The boys also discussed Chris Masten's future, with the struggling West Coast veteran contracted at the club until the end of 2019.

The Sunday Times sports editor Glen Quartermain said Masten would have no market value if put on the trade table.

"(West Coast have to) ride him out, then it's thanks for your service," Quartermain said.
