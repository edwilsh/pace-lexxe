  <title>Trump 'could be more dangerous' than Kim Jong-un</title>
  <content>
A PANELLIST on ABC'S Q&A program suggested US President Donald Trump could be more dangerous than North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.
"The one unstable element now is the other world leader with the powerful nuclear weapons and the crazy hair, which is Donald Trump, not Kim Jong-un," American journalist Mei Fong said on Monday night.
She made her comments as the panel discussed Mr Trump's administration and the vulgar comments of his communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, as well as North Korea's threat against the world.
Panellists said the world wanted America to become rational and stable to maintain the relationship between the US and Australia. Ms Fong suggested with Mr Trump pulling America out of the Paris Accords and him not taking a leadership role when it came to major concerns of the North Korean missile crisis, it appeared America was withdrawing from its leadership position.
"It's gone into a hermit-like position. If I were to think of 2017 as a symbol, I would think of it as a clam," she said.
But Ms Fong said Mr Trump was unpredictable, which could make him dangerous.
"He's unpredictable, everybody has said that. Everything you thought a President of the US would not do, some thing's he has done," she said.
"On the foreign policy, perhaps he hasn't done anything as radical as he has done internally, domestic policy. But this week it could change."
The panel also discussed whether Trump's volatile administration could affect the country's relationship with Australia.
"I thought Trump was a completely unacceptable person to be president. He has abundantly fulfilled that analysis. But nonetheless, the US alliance is of the most profound importance to Australia's national interest and indeed global security," Greg Sheridan, Foreign Affairs Editor at The Australian, said.
"So, what is smart for Australia to do through this period is to try and preserve the alliance and get what good we can out of Trump. There are a few good things in Trump. He's appointed a better cabinet and he hasn't done most of the radical things that he said. He speaks like a madman, but so far he hasn't done truly mad things.
"At the end of the day, there is no substitute for America. China cannot substitute for America."
The Q&A panel also discussed how Australia would fight North Korea's nuclear threat.
North Korea previously singled out Darwin as the site of a possible nuclear war, and a Q&A audience member asked if Australia would start analysing ballistic missile defence and launch missile defence in the country.
Minister for Trade and Investment Steve Ciobo said it was something the government thought about.
"That's what the Defence Department is looking at and the discussions we're having with the Americans and others. Unfortunately, North Korea is a clear and present danger. Not just for Australia but of course for the US as well," he said.
"I think perhaps the window of taking military action against North Korea is closed but these are the very real decisions that need to be made because every time you fail to act, when you should have acted, the consequences for then acting further down the track become much more profound."
When asked whether Australia was intending to develop a nuclear missile defence shield, Mr Ciobo said the experts at the Department of Defence were looking at what that might look like.
"How we achieve resolution is the question everyone is asking," he said.
"We must deal with the issue of North Korea. Whether that is through dialogue, which is always the preferable course of action, or whether is something else, we have to keep the options on the table."
When asked if that included military, he reiterated we had to keen options open.
"If you think we can defend ourselves from any threat you could justify spending billions of dollars on any sort of piece of military equipment and we've done that in the past and tend to buy outdated things," he said.

"This is well outside my area of expertise on the actual military threat but I causing against a sentiment that we can absolutely defend against these things by purchasing new weapons."
Shadow Minister for Finance Jim Chalmers said that would be a drastic step.
"At the end of the day, Kim Jong-un is a maniac and this is the biggest threat to our region right now, and so around the world. Not just the Australians, especially the Americans, South Koreans and Japanese, everyone who has got skin," he said.
