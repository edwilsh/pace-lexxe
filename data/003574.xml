A man has been bashed with a baseball bat and a crow bar by two men who forced their way into his Adelaide home.
The men fled in a Hyundai sedan driven by a third man on Tuesday night after the attack on the victim in his Elizabeth Park home.
Police say the injured man was treated at the Lyell McEwin Hospital for head lacerations and injuries to his arm.
