  <title>Just 10 days: Scaramucci already dumped from White House</title>
  <content>
US PRESIDENT Trump has decided to remove Anthony Scaramucci from his position as communications director, just over a week after he took on the job.

The White House confirmed his resignation in a statement on Monday. It came just days after Mr Scaramucci unloaded a crude attack against other senior members of the president's senior staff.

The decision to remove Mr Scaramucci reportedly came at the request the new chief of staff, John F Kelly, who was appointed on Monday in his new role. Mr Kelly was tapped by Mr Trump to bring some stability to an at times chaotic White House.

In the words of the White House announcement Mr Scaramucci was leaving because he "felt it was best to give new Chief of Staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team."

The two-sentence release concluded: "We wish him all the best."

CNN reported that Mr Scaramucci, known affectionately as The Mooch by friends and colleagues, was escorted off the property.

Mr Trump had insisted earlier on Monday that there was "no chaos" in his White House despite an array of resignations over the last two weeks.

Earlier in an Oval Office ceremony Mr Trump predicted Mr Kelly, who previously served as US Homeland Security chief, would do a "spectacular job."

The chief of staff is the highest ranking White House employee - a chief operating officer who organizes staff, manages the president's schedule and decides who gets access to him and when.

Many question whether anyone can rein in the mercurial, Twitter-happy Mr Trump, who has appeared to encourage the infighting among various factions vying for influence in his administration.

Mr Scaramucci's removal came just 10 days after he was brought on to the West Wing staff.

His arrival led to the departures of Sean Spicer, the former press secretary, and Reince Priebus, the president's first chief of staff.

Mr Scaramucci targeted Mr Priebus as well as chief White House strategist Steve Bannon in an expletive-filled interview with The New Yorker last week.
