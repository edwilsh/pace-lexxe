  <title>Pokies venues raking in $205,000 a day</title>

PEOPLE are pouring $205,000 a day into Knox's poker machines, as data shows pokies losses increased in the past year.
Figures from the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation showed Knox pubs and clubs collected $75 million from pokies in the 2016-17 financial year - up from $73.8 million in the previous financial year.
Knox had the 13th highest pokies losses of all Victorian local government areas, which had the City of Brimbank at the top with $134 million splurged on pokies in 2016-17.
Anti-pokies campaigner Tim Costello, from the Alliance for Gambling Reform, said the venues in Knox were "draining" money from the community.
He called on the Richmond Football Club to take a stand and withdraw its 97 machines from the Wantirna Club, which collected $5.4 million.
Knox Council opposed the Wantirna Club's application for another 10 gaming machines in 2009 - but that was overturned at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal in 2013.
The council is signed up as a supporter of the Alliance for Gambling Reform.
Council acting community services director Janine Brown said the council supported the alliance's campaign to reduce the harm caused by pokies machines.
Richmond Football Club did not respond to a request for comment.
