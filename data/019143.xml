  <title>Uni teach NT Thunder a new lesson</title>
  <content>
NT THUNDER coach Andrew Hodges believes his team simply did not show up in its 25.17 (167) to 7.7 (49) thrashing against Sydney University at Henson Park yesterday.
From the opening bounce the hosts asserted their authority, with quick forward ball movement leading to a James Brain goal inside the first 10 seconds.
Sydney has not been an ideal destination for the Thunder this season, with the Swans inflicting a 146-point thrashing on the team in Round 17.
"It was disappointing. They were very good and we played probably our worst footy of the season," Hodges said.
The match had a similar theme to University's 68-point win over the Territory outfit in Darwin in Round 10, where too often they created space and easy marking opportunities.
Damien Bonney (three goals), ruckman Sam Tagliabue (one goal), Jack Hiscox (one goal) and Xavier Richards (one goal) were among Uni's best.
"They put a lot of pressure on us. We'll review it and try to be better for it in our next game against Aspley after the bye," Hodges said.
Making three late changes with Hugo Drogemuller, Davin Ferreira and Jack Shannahan dropping out did not help the Thunder's cause.
The Students kicked a stack of easy goals courtesy of Thunder turnovers, excellent switch play and their far superior work in transition.
