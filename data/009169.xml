  <title>WA police officers cleared over treatment of Aboriginal man Clifton Penny</title>
  <content>
An internal investigation has cleared WA police officers of any wrongdoing over allegations they stomped on the head of an Aboriginal man earlier this year.
Police alleged Clifton Wayne Penny was in a stolen car when they arrested and charged him in January.
His family said police brutality during his arrest left him shaking uncontrollably for months.
But WA Police said its investigation had found the allegations baseless.
"The internal investigation into the Penny matter was finalised on 7 April 2017 with the allegations discovered to be without foundation and the subject officers exonerated," the one-line statement from a WA Police spokesman said.
Penny's sister, Esme Hart, said no-one from WA Police had told her.
"No, no, no-one has even told me, my grandfather or my dad," she said.
'Lack of respect'

Prison advocate Mervyn Eades, who made the official complaint, said he had not heard anything either.
"You know it just shows the lack of duty of care and respect to what we've witnessed with young Clifton and you know, did they even investigate it?  That's what it says to me," he said.
Penny was charged in early January with a string of offences, including the theft of several cars.
Police alleged he tried to flee as they approached him, two officers were injured and they Tasered him to avoid further injury.
Nine days later Mr Eades, who is the deputy chairman of WA's Deaths in Custody Watch Committee, recorded an interview with him.
The vision, released to the Guardian Australia, showed Penny constantly shaking.
"They dragged me along the hot concrete, stomped on my head and they Tasered me until I pissed my pants," he said in the recording.
Ms Hart said her brother was still shaking but not as much.
She conceded "he was no angel" and took drugs, but said she still found the incident hard to talk about.
"He could have died for all we know," she said.
WA Police declined the ABC's request for an interview and a copy of the internal investigation report.
The ABC also contacted the WA Police Union for comment, but the request was declined.
