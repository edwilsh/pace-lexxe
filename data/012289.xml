  <title>CBA risks massive fines over anti-money laundering, terrorism financing law breaches</title>
  <content>
The Commonwealth Bank has been accused of "serious and systemic" breaches of anti-money laundering and terrorism financing laws that could leave it exposed to massive criminal penalties.
The Australian Transactions Reports & Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) today launched civil proceedings in the Federal Court alleging that the Commonwealth failed to comply with the law on 53,700 occasions.
The allegations follow an AUSTRAC investigation into the CBA's use of intelligent deposit machines between November 2012 and September 2015.
The maximum penalty for each of the 53,700 contraventions is up to $18 million.
The potentially massive penalties would dwarf a $45-million fine imposed on Tabcorp earlier this year for failing to comply with anti money laundering and terror financing laws.
More to come.
