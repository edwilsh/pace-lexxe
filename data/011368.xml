  <title>The 'contact technician' who is toughening up Mitchell Moses</title>

A "contact technician" who played 20 first-grade games for Melbourne is the figure behind the vastly improved defence of Mitchell Moses, the mid-season Parramatta recruit who shapes as a central figure for the Eels as they gear up for their first semi-finals campaign in eight years.

However, he is keeping Brad Arthur content with the work he is doing with the Parramatta halfback inside a small room with a padded floor at the club's Old Saleyards Reserve training base.
Less than three months after he was granted an early release by Wests Tigers, Moses is no longer a defensive liability and according to teammates plenty of the credit goes to one of Arthur's staffers.
The tutelage of Moses, 22, has been conducted inside the walls of the so-called  "contact room" at North Parramatta, and the No.7 has spent a lot of time with O'Farrell instructing far bigger men to run at him.
The data and the optics suggest it is working. In the past five games, all won by the Eels to embed themselves inside the NRL's top eight, Moses missed only 13 tackles. Take a glance at his record in 10 matches for the Tigers this season and the number of times he had slipped off or been brushed off by an opposition player was 49.

Few doubted Moses' prodigious talent but his slender frame meant he could be vulnerable in defence. His vast improvement in that area, and in such a short period of time, makes him a more complete player, a very good result for Arthur and success-starved Eels supporters with September approaching.
"Before he came to Parra he wasn't known for his defensive abilities but now he makes his one-on-one tackles and even puts on a couple of shots now and again," Eels forward Tepai Moeroa said of Moses ahead of Thursday night's meeting with Canterbury at ANZ Stadium.

"He's brave, he's not afraid of the contact."
That was rammed home in the last Friday, and no more so than during a moment when Moses had the ball in his hands. He was running to the line in the first half and sent through a grubber kick - and was flattened for his troubles with what looked suspiciously like a shoulder charge by Broncos forward Adam Blair.
He went on to feature prominently in the Eels' most impressive performance this season. Moeroa, who is often stationed near Moses in the Eels' defensive line, has noticed his new teammate's rising confidence from close quarters. 
"We've got our contact technician 'Bump'. He's been working one-on-one with him ... tackle technique, wrestle and stuff like that," Moeroa said.
"It's more technique, teaching him how to tackle properly and build his confidence. I guess he's just been working hard on his defence in our contact room. He's not afraid to put a couple of shots on in there so I guess it's taking that confidence out on the field."
Moses told the NRL's website last month that O'Farrell had been "massive for me".
"[He] always gets me in before training to do a few extra tackles," he said.
He will be out to pull off a few more as Parramatta, also riding high on self-belief after knocking off the Broncos, look to ascend to a share of third place on Thursday night with victory over the Bulldogs.
