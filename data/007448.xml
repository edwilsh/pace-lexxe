Police are in the process of dismantling a hydro house filled with about 300 cannabis plants at West Wollongong.
Officers raided the Valetta Street home on Wednesday morning, finding 297 cannabis plants inside.
The plants, of varying stages in growth, were discovered in eight rooms and have an estimated street value of about $945,000.
Police investigations are ongoing. 
A neighbour told the Mercury he was surprised by the large police presence in what was a typically-quiet cul-de-sac.
''It's very, very quiet,'' Wolfgang Wendler, who lives across the road from the house at the centre of the raid, said. 
''These people over there, I've never actually met them but they lived a very quiet life by the looks of it.''
''There seemed to be a few young people who lived there.
''I'm shocked because I haven't seen sort of unusual traffic there, people coming and going.''

More to come.
