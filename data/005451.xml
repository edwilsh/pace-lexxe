  <title>Ban upheld: Hodge fails with Tribunal challenge</title>

Hawthorn veteran Luke Hodge

HAWTHORN champion Luke Hodge has failed in his bid to overturn a striking charge at the Tribunal on Tuesday night and will be sidelined for the Hawks' crunch game against Richmond on Sunday.

Hodge will be fined $2500 as a result of the failed challenge but he did not risk an extra week on the sidelines for his third low-level offence this season. 

The retiring AFL great argued his action was what the Hawks refer to as a "steel arm" to prevent Swan Tom Papley running in to an open goalsquare. 

But after a lengthy 21 minute deliberation the jury of Paul Williams, Stewart Loewe and Richard Loveridge disagreed and upheld the Match Review Panel's decision.  

"We disagreed with the Tribunal about it being a strike, we didn't think it was," Hodge said as he left the Tribunal at AFL House. 

"It's disappointing, 'Rough' (Jarryd Roughead) is playing his 250th this week and I guess that was a lot of the reason behind it as well, to try and get out there and play with him. 

"That's footy, you take what they give you and look forward to the week after."
