  <title>Five of the best Tassie cheeseries</title>
  <content>
WITH ideal producing conditions, Tasmania has gained a reputation for making some of the most exquisite cheeses in the world. So pour yourself a glass of vino, get the cheese board out and delve into the huge range of unique and distinctly Tasmanian cheeses the state has on offer.
Bruny Island Cheese Co.
Available at their Hobart Cellar Door, in the Salamanca Arts Centre, or 1807 Bruny Island Main Rd, Great Bay, Bruny Island
As the first producer of raw milk cheese in Australia, Bruny Island Cheese Company produces distinctly Tasmanian cheeses, each with their own individual flair. Providing a flavour experience you can't get anywhere else, the platter for two ($30) consists of five cheeses which vary daily depending on availability, fruit paste, biscuits and bread. With hard, soft, and semisoft cheeses on offer, there's a lot to try.
Grandvewe
59 Devlyns Rd, Birchs Bay
Visitors to Grandvewe, the only sheep milk cheesery in Tasmania, can select from up to 15 cheeses. Customers can create their own platters from a variety of sensational cheeses from varieties including Sapphire Blue and Halloumi, to Grandvewe Fresh and White Pearl. The sheep's milk gives their cheese uniquely mild, creamy, and slightly sweet flavour.
Wicked Cheese
1238 Richmond Rd,  Richmond
Filled with gold medallists and award winners, the Wicked Cheese's platters hold only the best. The platters available include the cow's milk cheese platter ($12 for one or $18 for two) has Wicked brie, Vintage Cheddar, and a blue, and the goat's milk platter ($15 for one and $22 for two) has Wicked Goat's triple cream brie, William Hard Cheese, and Nanny Goat Blue.
Coal River Farm
634 Richmond Rd,  Cambridge
Made on site from locally sourced milk, these cheeses are best enjoyed fresh from the platter on the farm. Served with fruit paste, grapes, and crisp breads, take your pick from the Triple Cream brie, Camembert, Washed Rind Camembert, Vine Ashed Log, and Coal River Gorgonzola style blue. A selection of two cheeses is $22, three is $29, and four is $36.
Ashgrove Cheese
6173 Bass Hwy, Elizabeth Town
The cheesemakers board ($15) at Ashgrove allows customers to choose their own cheeses and is served with two kinds of Manu sour dough. As a specialist in hard cheeses, Ashgrove's most popular selections are Wild Wasabi, and Bush Pepper, accompanied by something with a more mild flavour, such as the Vintage Cheddar or Rubicon Red.
