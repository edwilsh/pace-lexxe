  <title>Not a lounge - 'it's a hard-core jazz club'</title>
  <content>
A New Brunswick music venue is setting the standard for jazz.
The Jazzlab is the second jazz venue by Bennetts Lane founder Michael Tortoni and it continues his dedication to putting music first.
The Leslie St premises opened in April this year and already boasts music every night of the week, with midnight shows on Fridays and Saturdays.
"It's not a jazz lounge, it's a hard-core jazz club, it's all about pushing the boundaries," Tortoni said.
Weekends see jazz standards with "great female vocalists" while the weeknights are a beacon for musicians to experiment.
"On the weekends, it's much more accessible to a wider audience," Tortoni said.
"During the week, we indulge and have a little bit of fun."
The opening of the Jazzlab is a return to Brunswick roots for Tortoni, who grew up on Glenmorgan St in Brunswick East and spent his teens as part of teen band sensation Taste.

Tortoni and his fellow Moreland friends Joey Amenta, Ken Murdoch and now-world-famous drummer Virgil Donati were on the verge of international stardom until their parents ended the band.

With the likes of Harry Connick Jnr, Prince, Wynton and Branford Marsalis and Leroy Jones frequenting Bennetts Lane, Tortoni aims to set the same high standard with the Jazzlab.
This Saturday and Sunday, vocalist-composer will perform with Darrin Archer, Hiroki Hoshino and Aaron McCoullough.
Born in Australia, McNulty has spent the past three decades based in New York.
"She has a great reputation and a great band, she's amazing," Tortoni said.
