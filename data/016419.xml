A woman whose husband died of cancer was brought to tears by a birthday gift.
Danira Quijada opened the present as her children watched on at a restaurant.
"Squeeze its hand!" someone tells her.
Mrs Quijada does so, and is surprised to hear a sound she instantly recognises her late husband's laugh.
"After 32 years of marriage, cancer took my dad away," daughter Paola Lopez wrote on Twitter.
"So we got [my mom] a bear with his laugh on it for her birthday."
"You know what it's like to have everything and you also know what it's like to lose it all.
