  <title>Nicole Kidman struts the red carpet at premiere of new television series</title>
  <content>
Nicole Kidman has returned to Sydney for the premiere of her new television drama.
The actress stars in the sequel to the award-winning Top of the Lake series and said the small screen is growing ever more appealing.
"That's where obviously the great roles are being developed for women right now, they not in film they are in television," Kidman told 9NEWS Entertainment Editor Richard Wilkins on the red carpet at the Sydney Opera House tonight.
"Well they're in both ... they're rare in film though."
Top of the Lake: China Girl centres on the story of a young woman whose body washes up on Bondi Beach.
