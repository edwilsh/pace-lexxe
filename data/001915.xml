  <title>Nine.com.au reporter Emily McPherson nominated for Kennedy Award</title>
  <content>
Nine.com.au has taken out two of the three nominations for the Online Breaking news category at the prestigious NRMA Kennedy Awards for Excellence in Journalism.

Senior reporter Emily McPherson was shortlisted for her heartbreaking series on the tragic death of 15-year-old Victorian schoolgirl Cassidy Trevan.

Cassidy committed suicide after a group of schoolyard bullies orchestrated her gang rape. McPherson broke online the story of Cassidy's death and, in a series of five exclusive articles, revealed the full circumstances that led to her tragic suicide.

Nine.com.au was also nominated for its leading real time, in-depth rolling coverage of the bombing at Manchester Arena during an Ariana Grande concert.

Third spot in the category went to the Guardian's Christopher Knaus.

The 9News and A Current Affair teams also received a number of award nominations.

NSW state political reporter Chris O'Keefe marked a tremendous year by being nominated for The Rebecca Wilson Award for Scoop of the Year, the Outstanding Political Reporting Award, and - alongside Nine's Mark Burrows - the Harry Potter Award for Outstanding Television News Reporting.

O'Keefe was also shortlisted for the 2017 Coca-Cola Journalist of the Year alongside the ABC's Adele Ferguson and Caro Meldrum-Hanna.

A Current Affair's Dimity Clancey was short listed for Outstanding Nightly TV Current Affairs Reporting, while Nine's Aggie Bradshaw and Steve Marshall, from A Current Affair, were nominated for the Paul Lockyer Award for Outstanding Regional Broadcasts.

A Current Affair's Taylor Auerbach is in the running for Young Journalist of the Year. Winners will be announced at a gala event at Royal Randwick on August 11.
