A series of mobile billboard campaigns will be held in three Illawarra schools on Tuesday as the Public Education Alliance of teachers, parents and school principals steps up its campaign to protect Gonski funding to schools.

NSW Teachers Federation president Maurie Mulheron said the so-called Gonski 2.0 plan will mean a significant funding cut for all local schools in their electorates.
''We will not stand by and allow Malcolm Turnbull to cut school funding in NSW and that's why we are campaigning with a mobile billboard carrying the message 'Our Kids Can't Afford Turnbull's $846 Million Cuts to Gonski'," Mr Muheron said.

The Gonski mobile billboard is touring the state as the centre-piece of rallies at schools, in shopping centres and outside MP's electorate offices ahead of June's COAG meeting.
Billboard rallies will be held outside public schools at Barrack Heights, Warrawong and Nowra East on Tuesday.
