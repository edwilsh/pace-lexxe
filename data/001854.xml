  <title>Survivors of violence against women in Melanesia falling through gaps between custom and state authorities</title>
  <content>
Research into women's experiences of violence in Melanesia suggests there's still a gap between rhetoric and actual reform.
The University of Queensland's Dr Nicole George interviewed women across Fiji, Bougainville and Solomon Islands in 2015 and 2016.
Earlier we brought you the first half of this interview, where Dr George said that while leaders are more enthusiastic about reducing the high rates of violence against women, survivors still feel like their experiences are "just their own" and that they're not taken seriously by law enforcement.
In this second half, Dr George says the women she spoke to would usually prefer to have their situations dealt with by cultural authorities, but often felt like they had no option but to go elsewhere.
