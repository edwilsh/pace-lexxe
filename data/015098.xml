  <title>Falcons a path to the NRL for Ingebrigtsen</title>
  <content>
RUGBY LEAGUE: Craig Ingebrigtsen is loving life on the Sunshine Coast and believes the Falcons could provide him with an avenue into the NRL.
The respected coach has helped mould the team into a considerable force in the state league, since arriving in late 2015.
After taking Easts to two grand finals, he came to Bokarina and inherited a side which had endured some lean years and was one year into an affiliation with Melbourne Storm.
He promptly propelled the side from 12th to third in his first year at the helm, helping two of the club's players earn contracts in the NRL.
He's now got the team in second place nearing finals and this week signed a contract extension for 2018.
"My wife and I love it up here so....when they wanted to re-sign me I was quite happy to go around again," he said.
"And it's a good stepping stone for me into the next level.
"Obviously I want to coach at the next level but you've got to do your time (at a lower grade) first and what a great place to be doing it."
While the Falcons have an affiliation with the Storm, other top tier clubs are likely to notice Ingebrigtsen's feats in the Intrust Super Cup.
"At the end of the day, there's 16 NRL clubs and you've got to put yourself in a position where you can be picked up....so my job is to do the best I can and hopefully someone will recognise that one day and I'll get an opportunity," he said.
