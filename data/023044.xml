  <title>Labor to oppose welfare drug test trials</title>
  <content>
Labor will oppose the Turnbull government's move to randomly test Newstart and Youth Allowance recipients for drugs.
The government plans to roll out the scheme across three trial sites from January next year, affecting about 5000 people.
The Labor caucus on Monday voted to oppose the drug test trials and six other sections of the legislation and will reserve its position on the overall bill until after a Senate inquiry.
