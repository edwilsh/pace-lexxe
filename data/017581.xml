  <title>Fashion Q&A with Ajak Deng: 'I don't know how fashion will get over its obsession with fame'</title>
  <content>
Born in Sudan, raised in Melbourne and now living in New York, Ajak Deng made her runway debut at Melbourne Spring Fashion Week a decade ago while in year 12 and has since walked for the likes of Louis Vuitton, Givenchy and Jean Paul Gaultier.

Why did you become a model?
I wanted to join the army but my teachers at Kurunjang Secondary College told me no, that it wouldn't be for me. They knew I loved to travel and had a thing for fashion and suggested modelling. I have not looked back.
What have the highlights been?
Doing a Marc Jacobs beauty campaign, and one for Clinique make-up was also a good opportunity. I also became the face of Barney's New York this year, a face for M.A.C Cosmetics, and did covers for Harper's Bazaar Arabia, V Magazine and Vogue Italia.

How is Instagram changing modelling?
Sadly, the more Instagram followers you have, the more work you get. Being a model isn't enough. If you have 100,000-plus followers, you are considered somebody. I don't know how the fashion industry will ever come back from this obsession with fame.

Who are some of your favourite Australian designers?
I love Zimmerman for its sexy cool. If I want edgy and a don't-mess-with-me look, Toni Maticevski. I am also a big fan of Alice McCall - I love her dresses.

You've been doing lots of editorial work - is the runway still your top priority?
I am a runway girl 100 per cent. I am a total showgirl.
Who are the kindest people you've worked with in the fashion industry?
I love Jean-Paul Gaultier for his one-on-one time. He comes to the fittings, talks to you and gets you a cup of tea and a biscuit. He is so loving and genuine. Alexander Wang is another. I was also in a fashion shoot with singer Bruno Mars and he turned up with three trays of chicken wings for lunch. What a guy!
