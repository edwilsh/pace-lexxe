  <title>Amazon to create 'hundreds of jobs' after leasing fulfilment centre </title>
  <content>
Amazon says it will create 'hundreds' of new jobs after confirming the opening of its first Australian fulfilment centre in Dandenong in Melbourne.
Amazon's director of operations for Australia, Robert Bruce, said on Thursday the online retail behemoth would begin recruiting immediately for a range of roles including operations managers, pickers, packers, systems technicians, and HR specialists.
Retail analysts say the e-commerce giant is also seeking buyers for branded goods, suggesting  it plans to launch its suite of retail products and services within months, rather than in 2018, when most retailers and analysts expect the group to start shipping goods locally.

Late last month property sources told The Australian Financial Review .

Mr  Bruce confirmed the new 24,000 square metre site on Thursday, but did not clarify the timing of the launch.
"We are thrilled to be creating hundreds of new roles in Dandenong South," Mr Bruce said.
"This is just the start. Over time, we will bring thousands of new jobs to Australia and millions of dollars of investment as well as opening up the opportunity for thousands of Australian businesses to sell at home and abroad through Amazon Marketplace."
"This new fulfilment centre will stock hundreds of thousands of products which will be available for delivery to customers across Australia when we launch our retail offering," he said.

"We will be focusing on offering our Australian customers low prices on a great selection of products and can't wait to get started."
The fulfilment centre is located in the Pellicano's M2 Industry Park in Dandenong South, providing easy access to the South Gippsland Highway, Monash Highway and Eastlink. 
The building is also in close proximity to a wide range of amenities for employees. The lease of the centre was facilitated by CBRE's Industrial & Logistics business.
The Victorian Government has welcomed Amazon's investment in the state.

"Amazon is the latest global company to choose Victoria for its Australian operations," said Wade Noonan, Industry Minister for Victoria.
"The company's decision to locate its centre in Dandenong South will create hundreds of local jobs and open up retail opportunities for thousands of local businesses."
According to a landmark report by UBS ths week, , growing revenues from more than $400 million to about $3.5 billion by 2023 and crimping retailers' sales by around 2 per cent.
by prompting more consumers to shop online, where retailers' margins are thinner, by driving retail prices down significantly and by forcing retailers to invest hundreds of millions of dollars into e-commerce infrastructure which may take years to deliver returns.

UBS estimates that margins for major listed retailers will fall by between 100 and 200 basis points by 2023, dragging down earnings by as much as 20 per cent, with Super Retail Group, Myer and JB Hi-Fi the most exposed.
