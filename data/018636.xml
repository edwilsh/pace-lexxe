  <title>AFL retirees 2017: how big a hole do they leave?</title>
  <content>
Much has been made of certain draft classes. It is a neat way to group footballers and highlight special hauls. The 2001 "super draft" comes to mind. So too does Hawthorn's recruiting of Jarryd Roughead, Lance Franklin and Jordan Lewis inside a handful of picks in 2004. Carlton will hope Jacob Weitering, Harry McKay and Charlie Curnow - all taken early in the 2015 draft - can be pillars of a sustained period of contention.
But in the last week there was another reminder of how players can be grouped. Sam Mitchell and Luke Hodge both came to Hawthorn in the same draft, but following Mitchell's confirmation this will be his final season in the AFL, the pair's departures will also be aligned. Mitchell's retirement came in the same week as St Kilda great Nick Riewoldt, and just days after West Coast teammate and fellow Brownlow medallist Matt Priddis also announced that he is hanging up the boots.Photo: Joe Armao
Another mainstay - Adelaide bull Scott Thompson - has also declared he's giving it away, and there could be more to come, with the futures beyond this year of players like Bob Murphy, Jobe Watson, Jarrad McVeigh, Steve Johnson and Josh Gibson all yet to be announced.
It will have the effect of creating a serious squeeze for Hall of Fame spots when this year's group of retirees becomes eligible for induction in 2023. It also raises the question of where this lot of retirees stacks up compared to recent years. Is the hole being left bigger than usual? We've ranked the groups of retirees from 2008-2017 to see.Photo: Brendan Foster
1. 2016
Just like his predecessor as VFL/AFL games record-holder, Brent Harvey retired before he wanted. But that North Melbourne coach Brad Scott had his way, leading to the livewire's retirement, helps bolster an already impressive group. Matthew Pavlich is clearly Fremantle's greatest player and will walk straight into the hall of fame. So too should Corey Enright - a six-time All-Australian who twice won best-and-fairest awards in Geelong premiership years - and Jimmy Bartel, a Brownlow medallist, Norm Smith medallist and perhaps above all, a much-loved player. And speaking of much-loved Brownlow medallists, the roguish Dane Swan also finished at the end of 2016. That's not to mention Ted Richards, Sam Fisher, Nick Dal Santo and Adam Cooney.

This is a hell of a group. It starts with Adam Goodes and Chris Judd, both dual Brownlow medallists who have led their teams to premierships. That's before you even consider Goodes' off-field impact during his career and Judd's Norm Smith medal in a losing side. Then there's Dustin Fletcher, one of the finest defenders of his generation. Or should that be two generations, given his career was longer than any other player in league history. Norm Smith medallists Brian Lake and Paul Chapman, Port Adelaide champion Kane Cornes headline a terrific next tier which also includes Chris Newman and Luke McPharlin.
3. 2017
In Mitchell, Hodge and Riewoldt, we have three walk-up starts for the Hall of Fame. Mitchell and Hodge are both highly decorated premiership captains and four-time premiership players, with Hodge's two Norm Smith medals and Mitchell's underpinning their credentials. Riewoldt is widely considered to be among his club's top five greatest players, and has taken more marks than any player on record. Combined with Priddis, Thompson, and the possible additions of James Kelly, Drew Petrie, Murphy, Watson, McVeigh, Johnson, Gibson, Leigh Montagna, Matthew Boyd - and maybe just maybe Gary Ablett - means this is a year of farewells like few others.
4. 2010
This is a colourful group to say the least. Arguably the best player of the lot is Ben Cousins', a brilliant gut-running midfielder at West Coast whose plight has saddened the football community. Brendan Fevola's football career too came to an ignominious end, and things spiralled out of control for the dual Coleman medallist, but to his credit he appears to again be in a good place. Andrew McLeod was best afield in both of Adelaide's grand final wins and arguably the club's greatest ever player. Warren Tredrea led Port Adelaide to the club's maiden flag in 2004 and was one of the most commanding forwards of his era, while the names of Brad Johnson, Simon Goodwin, Tyson Edwards, Brett Kirk, Daniel Bradshaw, Steven King and Simon Prestigiacomo mean this was a year of rare depth in retirees.
5. 2008
Robert Harvey won two Brownlow medals and is St Kilda's games record holder. The man who followed him in "taking Charlie home" was Shane Crawford, another 2008 retiree. Harvey's teammate Fraser Gehrig developed a cult following but was also a sublime player, winning two Coleman medals. Another Coleman medallist is David Neitz, Melbourne's club games and goals record-holder, also good enough to earn All-Australian selection at centre half-back in 1995. Shannon Grant and Peter Bell starred in the Kangaroos' 1999 premiership victory, while Nigel Lappin, Peter Everitt, Scott West and Adem Yze all excelled.
6. 2009
Matthew Lloyd and Matthew Richardson are seventh and 12th respectively on the all-time goalkickers list so not surprisingly waltzed into the Hall of Fame. Leo Barry produced arguably the most critical moment of heroism in grand final history, while Tom Harley is a dual premiership captain. Scott Lucas, Adam Simpson, Michael O'Loughlin and Joel Bowden all made sizeable contributions too.
7. 2014
Dean Cox is widely considered the best ruckman to have played this century, Jonathan Brown is a yardstick for courage, while Lenny Hayes and Ryan O'Keefe are both Norm Smith medallists. Premiership captain Nick Maxwell shouldn't forgotten either, and nor should Cox's West Coast premiership teammate Darren Glass.
8. 2012
Luke Power was known for a time as the "fifth Beatle" of Brisbane Lions' acclaimed midfield, but there should be no playing down his achievements over more than 300 games, including the Lions' three premierships. But when it comes to triple-premiership players, there can have been few better than Geelong full-back Matthew Scarlett, who shone even before the Cats became the phenomenal force they were from 2007-2011. Chad Cornes' versatility was a feature throughout his storied career. Elsewhere things are a bit thinner, but David Wojcinski, Chris Tarrant, Brad Green and James McDonald all played some excellent football.
9. 2013
Simon Black sits with Bartel as the only players to have won both a Brownlow and Norm Smith, and also played 300 games. Like Bartel, he also earned a lot of admirers beyond fans of his own club. Daniel Kerr ran second in the 2005 Brownlow and was a key cog in West Coast's enviable midfield arsenal of the mid-2000s. Stephen Milne is among the most productive goalsneaks the game has ever seen, while Jude Bolton, Joel Corey, Andrew Embley and Darren Jolly all had terrific careers.
10. 2011
This was the group that became eligible for the Hall of Fame this year, and only Hall - a premiership captain and prolific goalkicker for three clubs - went straight in. Cameron Ling, another to be skipper of a premiership side, could perhaps consider himself unlucky given the reputation he built as both a forward and run-with player, while Brad Ottens, Cameron Mooney, Darren Milburn and Leon Davis' careers are nothing to sneeze at.
