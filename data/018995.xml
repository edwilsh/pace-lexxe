  <title>STYLEAID goes out in style</title>
  <content>
STYLEAID took its last hurrah in a spectacular flurry of fashion, feathers and drag queens at Crown Perth on Friday night.
The event has been the WA AIDS Council's major fundraiser for 20 years, raising more than $1.5 million since its inception in 1997 and showcasing acclaimed WA models such as Gemma Ward, Jessica Gomes and Nicole Trunfio, pre-fame.
But organisers decided this year was its last because of competition in the charity ball market.

Male models wearing budgie smugglers and an angel-winged hoop aerialist greeted the 700 guests in the lobby of Crown Towers. Inside the Crown Ballroom, a central circular stage gave everyone a prized view of the action.
Models paraded fashion by WA designers including Aurelio Costarella, Ae'lkemi, One Fell Swoop, Zhivago and Steph Audino, who was a volunteer at STYLEAID long before her fashions appeared on the runway.
"It has left a wonderful legacy," Audino said.
There were performances by the WA Ballet, singer Ali Bodycoat and disco drag queens before confetti rained on the grand finale, which featured a swimwear parade.
Channel 7's Cassie Silver and Matt Tinney hosted the Icon-themed event.
An artwork by WA artist Elle Campbell, valued at $4200, sparked a bidding frenzy at auction.
It culminated in the event's DJ Scott Rawson paying $10,500 for the piece, which paid homage to the volunteers and support given over 20 years of STYLEAID.
An evening dress by late WA designer Ruth Tarvydas, one of her last couture designs, fetched $5500 for the WA AIDS Council.
Among the guests was Australian Survivor contestant Sarah Tilleke, Ten Eyewitness News presenter Narelda Jacobs with her partner Lauren Swinfield, Perth's Spud King Tony Galati and Coventry Village owner Greg Poland.
