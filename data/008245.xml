  <title>Perth woman mauled to death by dog</title>
  <content>
A woman from Perth's southern suburbs has been mauled to death by a dog.
Sue Lopicich was walking a number of dogs at Barko's Boarding and Rescue in Southern River around 1.30pm yesterday when one of the animals turned on her.
She died at the scene.
When police arrived a short time later, one of the animals was so aggressive they called in rangers from the City of Gosnells.
Rangers then seized a bullmastiff and a bull terrier. 9NEWS understands it was the mastiff that attacked Ms Lopicich.
Ms Lopicich was a passionate animal lover who also used to work at the Animal Protection Society of Western Australia.
Police aren't treating her death as suspicious and are preparing a report for the coroner.
