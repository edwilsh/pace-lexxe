Bourke St had been closed to traffic between King and Spencer streets, Victoria Police said.
A Yarra Trams spokeswoman said crews were working to clear the scene as soon as possible but there would be some peak-hour delays with trams backed up along the tracks.
Route 96 had no trams between Stop 4 at Queen St and Stop at 130 Middle Park with passengers urged to switch to Route 16 trams to and from St Kilda.
Route 86 trams were diverting via La Trobe St between Victoria Pde and Spencer St.
An earlier fault had affected other services in the area, but this had been rectified.
