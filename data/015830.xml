  <title>Right To Life hit Vic Premier's electorate</title>
  <content>
Premier Daniel Andrews' electorate has been targeted by what he calls a "mischievous" and "misleading" Right To Life leaflet campaign against his proposed assisted dying laws.
Right To Life have been dropping the pamphlet throughout nine electorates, including Mr Andrews' seat of Mulgrave, as well as Bentleigh and Macedon, both held by Labor.
"That rather mischievous, almost misrepresentation of who the author of that pamphlet was, that's not particularly fair, I don't think that's right, it doesn't add to the debate," Mr Andrews told ABC Central Victoria on Friday.
