A man arrested at the Eiffel Tower brandishing a knife has told investigators he wanted to attack a soldier, a source close to the case told AFP Sunday.
The man, aged around 19 and with a history of psychological problems, also said he had been in contact with someone from the Islamic State terror group who had encouraged him, the source added, on condition of anonymity.
The incident happened late on Saturday night.
