  <title>Matildas blitz Brazil 6-1 in Tournament of Nations masterclass</title>
  <content>
Australia's women's soccer team have continued their astonishing run of form, claiming their first trophy in seven years as they dismantled a Brazilian line-up 6-1 at the Tournament of Nations in the United States.
After conceding in the opening two minutes of the match, the Australians were never troubled again as they began one of the greatest onslaughts in Matildas history.

Plays of the Week

Nail-biting finishes, ripping yorkers and hat-trick heroes, these are the plays of the week.

Lisa De Vanna's first-half double helped the team to a 4-1 lead at the break, with Caitlin Foord and Katrina Gorry the other Matildas scorers.

In the second half, it was more of the same for the Australians, with Foord scoring her second, while Sam Kerr joined the action late in the piece.
It was some measure of revenge for the Australians, who were knocked out in the quarter-finals of the Rio Olympics on penalties by Brazil.
Alen Stajcic's side needed just a draw to claim the friendly competition after earlier wins over world champions US - for the first time - and Japan.
