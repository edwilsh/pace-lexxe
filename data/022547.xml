  <title>North East Link options reveal new road could cost up to $20 billion </title>
  <content>
Four options for Melbourne's latest proposed tollroad, the North East Link, have been released, with one route set to cost more than $20 billion.

But the premier was quiet on how much it would set the taxpayer back.
"It's a bit early for us to be talking about final costs," Mr Andrews said.

"Any of these options will involve significant stretches of tunnel."
All options will link up with the Metropolitan Ring Road in Greensborough.

The options are:

Travels directly south through Heidelberg and Bulleen to the Eastern Freeway. It would be 11 kilometres in length and include a tunnel up to four kilometres long.

Follows power transmission lines through Greensborough and Lower Plenty and links to the Ringwood Bypass. This 24-kilometre link would have tunnels for almost three quarters of its length.

Extends along an existing freeway reservation in Eltham North and passes through sensitive green wedge land in Eltham and Warrandyte. The 26-kilometre route would have almost half its length in a tunnel.

The first option through Heidelberg and Bulleen was selected by then roads minister Tim Pallas in 2008 as the route for the road. At the time, Mr Pallas said this option would cost $6 billion.
But on Monday, Mr Andrews declined to put a price tag on any of the options, other than he expected it to cost "around $10 billion".
This would likely rule out all but the most direct option via Heidelberg and Bulleen.
Figures presented at a press briefing by the North East Link Authority did not put a specific price tag on each route, but based on the authority's per-kilometre costs,  the final option via Kangaroo Ground could cost more than $20 billion.
Last week, government agencies briefed affected parties that the price tag for any of the tollroad options ranged from $6 billion to $16 billion.
One group vowing to fight the two options starting in Eltham North is the Eltham Community Action Group.
Spokesman John Graves is an engineer who worked for VicRoads for 34 years before retiring in 2012.
Mr Graves, also a former mayor of the Eltham area, said it was crucial no freeway cut through green-wedge areas as both of these options would.
"If the North East Link cuts [through] the green wedge, the pressure on increasing development will be very strong," he said.
"In effect the size of the green wedge and its capacity to continue as the 'lungs' of Melbourne would be diminished or destroyed."
