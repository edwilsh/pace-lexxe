  <title>Tesla says Model S, Model X deliveries power quarterly revenue surge</title>
  <content>
Electric-car maker Tesla reported  and backed its delivery guidance for the second half of the year.
Shares of the company, which said it was averaging over 1800 net reservations per day for its mass-market Model 3 since the handover of the launch vehicles last week, rose as much as 5 per cent to $USUS342.1 in after-hours trading.
Tesla, which had faced production issues, maintained its delivery guidance of 50,000 vehicles for the second half of the year.
Chief executive Elon Musk said last week that the company would go through at least "six months of manufacturing hell".

The company said it had over $US3 billion in cash and cash-equivalents as of June 30, compared with $US4 billion at the end of the previous quarter and $US3.25 billion from a year earlier.

Automotive gross margin, which excludes the sale of zero emission vehicle (ZEV) credits, rose to 25 per cent from 23.6 per cent a year earlier.
The company said it expects positive Model 3 gross margins in the fourth quarter.
Revenue rose to $US2.79 billion from $US1.27 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $US2.51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Excluding items, the company lost $US1.33 per share, smaller than the analysts' expectations of a loss of $US1.82.

The company's net loss attributable to shareholders widened to $US336.4 million in the second quarter ended June 30, from $US293.2 million a year earlier.
On a per share basis, net loss attributable to shareholders narrowed to $US2.04 from $US2.09.
"We delivered 22,026 Model S and Model X vehicles in Q2, for a total of 47,077 in the first half of the year. Model S and Model X combined deliveries in Q2 grew almost 53 per cent globally versus the prior year, even though the luxury vehicle market was essentially flat. The combined Model S and Model X market share grew in the US premium luxury vehicle market during Q2 2017," the company said in its statement.
Tesla's shares are up 52.5 per cent this year, as of the closing bell, though they have fallen from a peak of $USUS386.99 in late June.
