The film, created by US animation students Esteban Bravo and Beth David off the back of a $US14,000 Kickstarter fund, was the #1 trending clip on the video site on Thursday morning.
The award-winning short focuses on shy redhead Sherwin, who "runs the risk of being outed by his own heart after it pops out of his chest to chase down the boy of his dreams," a plot description explains.Photo: In a Heartbeat YouTube
The four-minute video finds Sherwin struggling to hide his true emotions as his runaway heart makes a dash to alert his crush of his true feelings.
Viewers have praised the heartfelt film for its honesty in depicting the inner turmoil that young gay people face as they begin to embrace their sexuality in the face of societal discrimination.

"The original pitch was a story between a boy and a girl, but it wasn't until we made it about a same-gender crush that the idea really started to take form and resonate with Esteban and I," David told NBC News.
"There have been a few nods to the LGBTQ community in recent children's programming, but it's very rare that an LGBTQ character is given the spotlight," Bravo added.
"We tried to tell this story from a genuine place and be as emotionally honest as we could about how especially layered this experience is for LGBTQ kids."
The film's two characters have already earned countless tributes online, with the civil rights organisation Human Rights Campaign also tweeting out the film to its almost 800,000 followers, saying: "All. The. Feels. We can all relate to this."
