In the latest episode of the Real Footy Podcast, Sam McClure, Caroline Wilson and Greg Baum say Richmond fans should be worried.
They also discuss Gary Ablett, his playing situation this season and the speculation over whether he will move back to Geelong, which is "tainting" his career.
Also on the agenda this week: Patrick Dangerfield's suspension, the race for the Coleman Medal, whether the AFL should do away with the draw and if the Bulldogs have their mojo back.
All this, plus new views on Nathan Buckley's job safety, a Bomber has his car impounded and the round 23 clash that's set to be chock full of fascinating storylines.
