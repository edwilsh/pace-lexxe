  <title>Man who cut up friend jailed for 22 years</title>
  <content>
A gambling addict who bludgeoned his best friend to death after being refused $100, then dismembered his body and disposed of his remains in various locations has been jailed in Perth for 22 years.
David Napier murdered 70-year-old Richard Andrews at the victim's Calista home by bludgeoning the back of his head with a hammer then cutting up his body with a hacksaw, including severing his fingers, and smashing his face with an axe in a bid to prevent identification.
Napier initially denied the crimes but later confessed to police and led them to Dwellingup State Forest and Gidgegannup where he'd hidden body parts, but some remains were never found.
