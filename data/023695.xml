  <title>Cranky dog plays dead for almost a minute in front of crowd</title>
  <content>
A disobedient dog has left its owner red-faced after playing dead in front of a large crowd on the Gold Coast.
Video shows the golden retriever refusing to follow his owner while on a walk at Burleigh Hill.
Not wanting to put a paw forward, the dog flops to the ground in protest.
For almost a minute, the owner tries to tug the canine along on the lead.
At one point, the visibly frustrated pet owner stretches out the animal's "lifeless" front leg in an attempt to make it budge.
Dozens of onlookers are shown smiling, laughing and pulling out their phones to capture the beachside stand-off.
The cheeky pooch finally responds to his owner's call to come after being let off the lead, earning a rapturous applause from the crowd.
