  <title>Zach Merrett 'disappointed' with his punch on Lachie Plowman, expects MRP scruitiny</title>
  <content>
Essendon's Zach Merrett says he is "very disappointed" with himself for punching Carlton's Lachie Plowman during the Bombers' win over Carlton on Saturday, in an incident that will come under MRP scrutiny and could end the midfielder's Brownlow Medal hopes.
Merrett told Channel Nine's Sunday Footy Show that he shouldn't have lashed out as he did but also suggested he was provoked after some attention he received off the ball.

Bombers win thriller against Carlton

Essendon cruised to an early lead before dropping the advantage in the third quarter, Anthony McDonald-Tippingwuti saved the day scoring two in the final quarter for an Essendon eight-point-win.

"Yeh there was a few incidents behind the ball that I probably got a little bit frustrated with and yeh, I shouldn't taken my anger out on Lachie Plowman but yeh, looking back it was very disappointing," Merrett said.  
"I'm sure they [the MRP] will have a look at it, there's been guys that have done similar things and gotten away with fines so hopefully I can get away with that."

Merrett has had a stellar season and is third favourite for the Brownlow Medal behind Dustin Martin and Tom Mitchell. The incident comes the week after . 

Essendon coach John Worsfold was less than impressed with his midfielder's conduct, with the Bombers still needing to finish the season strongly against Adelaide (Etihad Stadium), Gold Coast (Metricon Stadium) and Fremantle (Etihad Stadium) to ensure a spot in the finals. 
"You just wonder why it happens. What are they thinking?," Worsfold said. "It's easy for us, fresh and enjoying the contest, generally enjoying it [but] players are under under enormous pressure .... I am sure Zach is disappointed with his action, especially because, again, we sit here wondering if it is going to affect the team. We want to be better than that.
"We will certainly talk through it and ask him, one, why it happened and then what happened after that - resilience and experience is something he can learn from." 
AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan and former league football operations boss Simon Lethlean both signalled a crackdown on punching earlier in the year after a spiteful game between Melbourne and North Melbourne. 
Since then incidents involving punches have been assessed by the MRP in a harsher manner.
It will be a busy Monday for the MRP with Brodie Grundy, Tom Hawkins, Jake Melksham, Ben Cunnington and Mitch Duncan likely to have incidents they were involved in assessed.
Hawkins hit Dane Rampe in the chin with a jumper punch in Geelong's loss to Sydney on Friday night while in the same game against the Cats Mitch Duncan punched Tom Papley in the chest.
Grundy tackled North Melbourne's Ben Brown in Collingwood's win over the Kangaroos on Saturday night. The ruckman had Brown's arms pinned in the tackle, with the forward's head smashing into the ground.
Brown left the field with concussion and did not return. The incident has re-igited the debate over dangerous tackling which has bubbled away throughout the past couple of season's and reached a high point with the Dangerfield-Kreuzer incident last week.
