  <title>Undetermined if missing fisherman dead or alive during shark attack, inquest hears</title>
  <content>
It cannot be determined if one of two missing fishermen was alive or dead when his arm was bitten by sharks off Coral Bay, in WA's north, an inquest has heard.
The inquest was examining the suspected deaths of Nigel Kitchen, 50, and Andrew Hinds, 57, who disappeared in May last year.
It heard sea conditions at the time were rough and it was likely their 8.2 metre boat was swamped by a wave just after they set out, in what was described as a sudden and catastrophic event.
The men from Rockingham were 10 days into a two-week trip that had been organised by their fishing club, and before they set out on Mr Hinds' boat they had not told anyone where they were going.
About three hours after they left, a charter boat skipper found debris in the water, but it did not cause any alarm because at that stage the men had not been reported missing.
Three hours later their friends became concerned they had not returned and they notified police.
Arm only remains found

A five-day air, land and sea search failed to find the men, although an arm belonging to Mr Kitchen was found two days later by a tourist snorkelling in the area.
Counsel assisting the coroner Lyle Housiaux said an examination of the arm concluded it had been "traumatically amputated" and if Mr Kitchen was alive, blood loss would have led to his death.
Sergeant Housiaux said a shark expert had formed the opinion the arm had been bitten by more than one species, most likely a grey reef shark and tiger shark.
Investigating police officer Andrew Stevens told the inquest it could not be determined with any certainty if the injury to the arm was caused when Mr Kitchen was "alive or not".
Senior Sergeant Stevens said while sharks were predatory, they were also scavengers and "eat what's in front of them".
"A shark could carry food for quite a long way, without regurgitating it or dropping it," he said.
Sergeant Stevens said the men were both "experienced and competent fisherman" and their boat had safety equipment on board, including two EPIRBS and two mobile phones.
He said it was likely they were swamped by a wave and had no time to use or activate any safety measures.
Coroner recommends new safety devices

Deputy State Coroner Evelyn Vicker said on the evidence before her she was satisfied both men were deceased.
She said she would be recommending boat users consider using water activated life jackets and EPIRBS, instead of the equipment the men had, which needed to be manually activated.
Ms Vicker also said she would recommend that people notify others where they were going and how long they were expected to be away, noting that in this case "there was a six-hour window before a search was conducted, which really did reduce the chances of the men being found alive".
After the inquest, Mr Kitchen's daughter Jessica said her father's death was a "freak accident" and she agreed with the recommendations proposed by the coroner.
"Anything that you can do to improve safety is something that's worth doing," she said.
Mr Kitchen's ex-wife Tracy Whiteside said she also hoped others would learn from what had happened.
"The boys from the fishing club are already doing things a little bit differently, I believe."
Ms Vicker is expected to deliver written findings later this year.
