  <title>Hundreds attend Sydney gay marriage rally</title>
  <content>
Hundreds of Sydneysiders have attended a rally supporting same-sex marriage, on the eve of a Liberal party room meeting on the issue.
Protesters carried signs saying, "Love is about hearts not parts", "We didn't vote on your marriage" and "Just let my mums get married" at the event at Town Hall, organised by GetUp and Community Action Against Homophobia.
GetUp marriage equality campaign director Sally Rugg told the crowd they could not rest until the law reflected the value of equality. The protesters later marched to Oxford Street chanting "gay, straight, black or white, marriage is a civil right".
Meanwhile in Melbourne chilly temperatures kept crowds small with roughly 30 people attending a snap rally at the State Library in the city.
Organised by Equal Love and attended by Victorian Greens senator Janet Rice who said she wanted to a see a free vote in parliament.
