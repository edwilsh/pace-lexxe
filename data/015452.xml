  <title>Flood warning for the Adelaide Hills</title>
  <content>
Flood warnings have been issued for parts of the Adelaide Hills as South Australia braces for heavy rain over the weekend.
The Bureau of Meteorology says local falls could top 100 mm by Sunday causing rivers and creeks across the Mt Lofty Ranges to rise.
A series of cold fronts are moving across the state which could also bring damaging winds, high sea levels and large waves.
"We've got a very significant few days of weather coming up," meteorologist Paul Lainio said on Friday.
The areas most at risk of flooding include around the towns of Oakbank and Verdun in the upper catchment of the Onkaparinga River.
