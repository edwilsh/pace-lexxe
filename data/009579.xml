  <title>Grenfell council Kensington and Chelsea 'accidentally' emails newspapers sensitive information on wealthy residents</title>
  <content>
LONDON - An email from the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea council containing sensitive information about residents appears "accidentally" to have been sent to multiple recipients, including the Guardian newspaper.

The Guardian  that the council sent an email listing owners of the 1,652 properties in the borough it considers "unoccupied."

It contained high-profile names, including Michael Bloomberg, the former Mayor of New York, and Ukrainian billionaire Dmytro Firtash, as well as a string of properties registered off-shore.

The west London borough contains Grenfell Tower, the block of flats where at least 80 people died in June after it caught fire.

The council came under intense pressure to re-home survivors of the blaze in empty properties in the borough, which is one of the richest in London. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said families who survived the blaze should "occupy" empty homes in the area.

Business Insider has contacted the council for comment.
