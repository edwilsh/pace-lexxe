Pick a Winner: StK v WC
Duck and Browny preview the Saints v Eagles

SUMMARY
It's that time of year when the champions announce their retirements and this clash is sure to be charged with emotion after six-time St Kilda best and fairest Nick Riewoldt declared he would finish up at season's end. Saints fans will be charged with emotion as their side attempts to make finals to give the star forward one last chance at a flag. This clash looms as crucial for both teams' bids to make September. At 9-9 and on the back of a devastating loss to Port Adelaide, Riewoldt's side simply must win to stay in the hunt. The same can be said about West Coast, which is hanging on to eighth place at 10-8 despite inconsistent form. Eagles coach Adam Simpson would hope his players don't produce a similar effort to their last game at the Docklands venue, when they were smashed at the coalface by Collingwood (which had two fit players on the bench) in the final quarter to cough up a 24-point lead.

THE SIX POINTS
1. In round two, the Saints led by six points at the final change before the Eagles kicked five goals to one. There was some controversy with the home side enjoying a 23-8 free kick advantage.

2. The Saints are ranked sixth for marking the ball inside 50, averaging 12.7 per game. The Eagles are narrowly behind in 10th, with 12.3 per game.

3. West Coast has dominated St Kilda over a long time, winning the past eight matches. St Kilda's last win was in round 17, 2011.

4. Josh Kennedy has made a big difference for the Eagles since returning from a calf injury, booting 15 goals in just three games and back-to-back hauls of six. Kennedy has kicked four or more in three of his last four games against St Kilda.

5. After kicking 21 goals in round 16 against Richmond, the Saints have struggled to score in the last three weeks, averaging 59 points per game.

6. Seb Ross is into the top 40 of the Schick AFL Player Ratings for the first time in his career, moving up to No.39 after his match-high 31 disposals against Port Adelaide last week. 

IT'S A BIG WEEK FOR... Josh Kennedy.
After winning the last two Coleman Medals, the Eagle trails Essendon's Joe Daniher in first place by four goals. It would be a remarkable effort if Kennedy could add another goalkicking award to his collection after missing five games with a calf injury and another bag against the Saints could set up a thrilling finish to the Coleman Medal.

PREDICTION: St Kilda by eight points.
