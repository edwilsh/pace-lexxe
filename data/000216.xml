  <title>St Kilda champion Nick Riewoldt set to announce his retirement</title>
  <content>
St Kilda champion Nick Riewoldt is set to retire at the end of the season.
Fairfax Media understands that the veteran, who is a six-time best and fairest with the Saints, is due to tell his teammates of his decision at the club's Seaford headquarters on Monday morning.Photo: AAP
It is understood there will be an official announcement as early as Monday afternoon.
Riewoldt was rested on the weekend from the match against Port Adelaide, which St Kilda narrowly lost, and had been pushing for a decision from the club about his future in recent weeks.
It remains unclear what the plans of fellow Saints veteran Leigh Montagna are after he severely tore his hamstring.
