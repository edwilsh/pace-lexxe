A young father and husband has died after an incident at a mine west of Mackay in Queensland.
Daniel Springer, 31, died following an incident at the Goonyella Riverside mine on Saturday.
He left behind a wife and young child.
Mr Springer's friend, Jake Tredwell, posted a heartfelt farewell on Facebook following news of the death.
"My heart sunk last night when I heard that one of the biggest bloody legends of all time had been taken from us," he said.
"I know you touched a lot of people brother and damn sure will be missed. Thoughts are with your family. See you on the other side Springer."
Natural Resources and Mines Minister Anthony Lynham confirmed the death on Monday night and said investigations were under way.
