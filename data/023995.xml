  <title>Lankan looks west for next start</title>

MICK Price will send star sprinter Lankan Rupee to -Adelaide for his next start.
Price said he thought Saturday week's 1200m Spring Stakes at Morphettville a better option for the eight-year-old's second-up run than the 1400m P.B. Lawrence Stakes at Caulfield on the same day.

Price was pleased with  at Sandown Hillside, his first run since November.
"He pulled up really well in terms of soundness,'' he said.
"He pulled up OK otherwise as it was his first run back from a long break and he put a lot of effort into it.
RACEDAY FOCUS:
"He raced well. He was beaten by a horse who's in the zone and they spaced the rest.
"To be fair the winner did a good job and so did Lankan.

"The Spring Stakes sits in perfectly in his program and you'd have to think he's going to be a great winning chance.
"He's been hanging out at my stable for several months, so a trip away will do him the world of good."
The weight-for-age Spring Stakes has been won by some top horses, including Redelva, who landed three in a row from 1988-90, and Happy Trails in 2012.
Price said after the Spring Stakes Lankan Rupee would contest the $1 million Memsie Stakes at Caulfield on September 2. The 1400m event would be his first race beyond 1200m.
