  <title>Holden's Elizabeth plant to move to museum</title>
  <content>
South Australia's Holden factory will have a permanent exhibition at the National Motor Museum, as the manufacturer prepares to end its Australian production later this year.
SA Minister for Automotive Transformation Kyam Maher says six replica assembly-line stations based on the Elizabeth plant will be suspended from the museum's ceiling to celebrate the company's history in the state.
"For over 50 years, generations of South Australians have worked in the automotive industry, and we should be proud that we are one of only 13 countries who can build cars from scratch," Mr Maher said in a statement.
