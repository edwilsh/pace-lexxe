  <title>Queanbeyan police officer faces court on assault charges</title>
  <content>
A police officer has been charged over an alleged assault at Queanbeyan earlier this year.
Joseph Steven Fairless, 44, of Bungendore, was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault.
He appeared in Queanbeyan Local Court on Monday where he pleaded not guilty to both charges.
NSW police allege the incident occurred during the arrest of a man just after midnight on Sunday, March 5.

The officer, a senior constable, was on duty.
A spokeswoman for NSW Police said the officer was stood down from active duty following the alleged incident.
The spokeswoman said he would remain so depending on the outcome of the court case.
Bail was continued in local court on Monday, with the man to reappear before the court in September.
