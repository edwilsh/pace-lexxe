  <title>Clouds tease Townsville today</title>
  <content>
THERE is a forecast for rain today but the Bureau of Meteorology has dampened down hopes for substantial falls.
The official prediction has a 40 per cent chance of light showers for Townsville this morning.
But forecaster Adam Blazak said any rain would be very light and scattering.
He said little more than 0.2mm of rain was expected.
"Today you might see cloud around and the odd spit of rain here and there," he said.
Mr Blazak said there were rain clouds in the area but they were mostly pushing to the north towards Cardwell.
Today the mercury will peak at 26 degrees, which is about average for July and August.
There is also a 30 per cent chance of showers on Wednesday but the forecast amount of rain is minimal.
