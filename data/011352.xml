  <title>Two Crows set for Showdown but Eddie unsure</title>

Brad Crouch looks set to bolster the Crows' midfield in this week's Showdown

ADELAIDE coach Don Pyke is confident Brad Crouch and Jake Lever will return for Sunday's clash with Port Adelaide, but isn't as sure about Showdown specialist Eddie Betts. 

The dangerous small forward had his appendix removed early last week and missed last weekend's draw with Collingwood at the MCG. 

"He's returned to some running over the weekend and we'll just build him up this week," Pyke told reporters on Thursday morning. 

"I believe he (saw the surgeon on Tuesday or Wednesday), it will be more how he presents now and how he goes in terms of training. 

"We'll get through training this morning and assess them from there."

All three will have to get through Thursday's closed training session at Adelaide Oval.

Lever has missed the past two games with hamstring tightness, while Crouch has missed one week with a fractured cheekbone.

"Lever should be fine," Pyke said. "(Crouch) should be (fine)."

The Power's only injury concern is around defender Matthew Broadbent, who is in some doubt with an ankle injury he's carried this year.

"Broadbent's a bit scratchy still coming off that ankle, so we'll wait and see what that looks like," Power coach Ken Hinkley said.
