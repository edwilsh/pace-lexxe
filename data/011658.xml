  <title>Trump hits back at claim that he called the White House 'a real dump'</title>
  <content>
Trump appears to have changed his tune on what he thinks about the White House.

In a Wednesday night , he called his presidential residence "one of the most beautiful buildings" he has ever seen. He called a claim made in a Golf Magazine article that he told members of his New Jersey golf club  "totally untrue."

Trump lobbed the criticism while among guests at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf establishment, according to the magazine, which said Trump cited that as a reason why he goes golfing so much.

Trump has spent most of his time off as president at his golf courses, including the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, his New Jersey golf club, and his golf course in suburban Washington, DC. According to the website, , the president has spent 41 days at his golf clubs since his inauguration.
