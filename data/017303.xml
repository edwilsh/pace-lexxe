  <title>Man charged after fleeing police drug test</title>
  <content>
A man who sped off after allegedly failing a roadside drug test has been arrested and charged.
The incident took place just after 5pm on Friday when police stopped the car for allegedly speeding on the Pacific Highway at Doyalson on the NSW Central Coast.
When he was told he was under arrest for failing the drug test, the 35-year-old driver started his vehicle and drove away.
During the subsequent pursuit, the man crashed into another car and a bus. He was caught by members of the public as he tried to flee on foot and handed over to police.
The man was charged with exceeding the speed limit, pursuit under Skye's Law, driving recklessly and escaping lawful custody.
He has been given strict conditional bail and will appear before Newcastle Local Court on August 24.
