  <title>Coast was a mystery to buyers in the '90s</title>
  <content>
I STARTED my real estate career in 1991 after sailing into Mooloolaba.
Back then, the marketing was very much about letterbox drops, walking the pavement door-knocking, conducting open homes. Believe it or not, we used two-way radios to communicate with the office. That was considered high tech!
The 1990s on the Coast were very challenging years in real estate as some of the suburbs seemed very foreign to buyers. I recall a lot of my conversations with buyers talking about areas such as Mooloolaba, Minyama Waters and Buddina and they would have trouble trying to pronounce them, let alone know where they were located.
I used to say "40 minutes south of Noosa" and they'd kind of understand.
Minyama Island was released in the early 1990s with Grant and Lisa Kenny and Greg and Olga Gardener, of GJ Gardener Homes, the first ones to build. Land sales started at $300,000.
Mooloolah Island was released in the mid-1990s, with prices also starting around $300,000. I remember taking four blocks on Mooloolah Island to auction for a client and they all sold from around the $450,000 up to the low $500,000s. That was a good result back then.
In 1999 and 2000, the waterfront marketplace increased almost three-fold. All of sudden we were selling the blocks in the low $1 million and simply couldn't get enough stock.
In the late 1990s my marketing took a whole new direction - email data basing. This revolutionised my way of selling real estate and in the early to mid-2000s, it was mayhem and totally a sellers' marketplace.
Technology had widened the scope to reach buyers around the world and we never looked back. Our average sale price jumped and all of a sudden the $400,000 homes were now fetching $1 million and the top end such as Minyama Island went from $3 million to $6 million and upwards.
From the late 1990s and through the early to mid-2000s, local developers such as Forrester Parker Group and Juniper Group exposed this small local area to high-end buyers and investors all over Australia, New Zealand and Asia.
This put areas such as Mooloolaba and Minyama on the map whereby buyers now were able to pronounce the names properly and actually know where we were located.
Technology is very much part of how I present my properties but technology in sales only complements what we do. It never takes away from face-to-face business or picking up the phone. This is what all humans desire: the personal contact.
Technology will continue to evolve and, as an agent, that is very exciting. I keep my marketing very specialised and endeavour to discover new ways of presenting my properties.
When I opened my own office in Kawana Waters back in 2001, I decided to locate in a commercial building upstairs, doing away with window displays and I suppose making it more professional and difficult for people to find me.
At the end of the day, the office to me is merely an administration space providing a support for all of us working in the field. It's a place for meeting people and doing deals.
With technology, we now also work remotely from home, phones or laptops although the phone is obviously very much taking over from all ways of doing business.
