  <content>
South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill is set to reveal details of another key part of his government's $550 million energy plan.
Mr Weatherill and Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis will make the announcement on Tuesday morning.
The government recently announced tech billionaire Elon Musk would build the world's largest battery for storing renewable energy in SA's mid-north, with the energy plan to also include more gas-fuelled generation.
