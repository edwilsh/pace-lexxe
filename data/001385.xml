  <title>Powerhouse Museum's fate still unclear as Berejiklian pushes ahead with Parramatta move</title>
  <content>
The future of the current Powerhouse Museum site in Ultimo remains in limbo, despite the NSW Government pressing ahead with its plans to move the institution to Parramatta.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has announced the Government is spending $140 million to buy the future site of the museum on the banks of the Parramatta River.
"Let me be clear, there'll be one Powerhouse Museum here, it will be across the river at Parramatta," she said.

The Government will buy the site of the old David Jones carpark from Parramatta council, under a deal which will see the council use the money to upgrade the Riverside theatre and create a dedicated western Sydney arts fund.
But the Premier confirmed the Government would not proceed with her predecessor Mike Baird's plan to sell off the entire existing Powerhouse site at Ultimo to fund the construction of the new museum.
"I don't just want it to be residential units," Ms Berejiklian said.
"If we can do something really creative with the Ultimo site, why shouldn't we do it, why would we just take the easy option and sell it to developers?"
Ms Berejiklian said at least part of the Ultimo site would be kept as cultural space, but she would not be drawn on what that might look like or what proportion of the existing space might still be sold for housing.
President of the museum's Board of Trustees Professor Barney Glover said he believed the museum's collection could be spread across both sites.
"More than 90 per cent of the exhibits are not on display at the moment, we want to see more of that on display," he said.
"The board is very keen to see a substantial presence for the museum retained at Ultimo.
"The Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences already has three great locations and the Powerhouse is just one of them.
"We believe ... it can be one museum across four sites."
Professor Glover suggested touring exhibitions could be displayed at both Ultimo and Parramatta.
Ms Berejiklian said decisions would not be made about the Ultimo site until the business case was finalised later this year.
