  <title>'I hope it's something we can still knit scarves for': New art at Hughes shops</title>
  <content>
It doesn't take long for a conversation to start at the Hughes shops about the much-loved artwork Stepping Out (Lady in Pearls). Stolen more than a year ago, with no trace since of the statue, it was unceremoniously cut off at the knees by the thieves.
Friends Joyce van Leeuwen and Coral Sadler, on their way to tai chi class at the local shops, let Arts Minister Gordon Ramsay know their thoughts as he announced on Friday that the community would be consulted on a replacement artwork, the ACT Government budgeting $100,000 for the new piece.Photo: Megan Doherty
Only a plaque in pavers remains of the stolen artwork, a life-like woman with handbag over her wrist, which locals regarded as their own, knitting scarves for her in winter and placing flowered garlands on her head in spring.
Joyce and Coral have their own thoughts about her.

"I used to call her 'our little lady'. What did you call her Coral?"â€‹ Joyce asked.
"I think I called her, 'That dowdy old lady," Coral said.

"Coral didn't like her hat or shoes," Joyce said.

"Do you miss her?" asked Joyce.
"Oh, yes," Coral saidPhoto: Megan Doherty
"Everyone was very cross with those people who took her," Joyce concluded.

Mr Ramsay said there had been no trace of her and there was no hint of what happened to her, whether the statue was melted down for the bronze, had ended up in someone's garden or was just a wanton act of vandalism.
"The police have been investigating. It's one of the sad things we do not know what happened to her," he said.Photo: Elesa Kurtz
"There's [a certain amount] of speculation. What we can do is make sure as we engage with the community we have something that can hopefully fill the hearts of the community the way the Lady in Pearls always did."
Finding an artwork that will inspire that same sense of ownership and celebration of Hughes is the motivation behind six weeks of consultation with the community to get their ideas of what kind of artwork should take pride of place at the shops.
"What it is they want to celebrate," Mr Ramsay said
"And after we engage, we will be forming a new artist's brief to be able to come up with something new."
One of the artists who created Stepping Out, Giovanna Ianniello, will be involved in the consultation and will attend two drop-in sessions with the community.
Mr Ramsay said the new artwork had a budget of $100,000.
"We believe that value is something we can work with and come up with a wonderful piece of art," he said.
The former statue can not be recreated as the original moulds no longer exist.
People can give their thoughts about the proposed statue at    or by attending one of the drop-in sessions at the Hughes shops on Tuesday, August 22 from 2pm to 4pm and Saturday, August 26 from 10am to noon.
"Public art is one of the great things about Canberra. It engages people. It's accessible. It helps people think through what they value about community," Mr Ramsay said.
"What we intend to do here, as we consult with people, as we listen, we will know that we have another piece of art that people value, that people engage with. And hopefully, as it was with Lady in Pearls, becomes part of the community."
ACT Policing confirmed it had not been able to find the stolen artwork.
It is encouraging anyone with information or knows the whereabouts of the statue to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. Information can be provided anonymously.
