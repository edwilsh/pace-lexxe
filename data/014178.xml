  <title>Pace wins approval for Abbotsford apartment</title>
  <content>
Melbourne-based Pace Development Group has won planning approval to build a 12-level apartment above Abbotsford's St Crispin House.
The mid-tier developer, best known for projects south of the Yarra River, will build 133 apartments above 247-259 Johnston Street, home to the historic industrial building St Crispin House, which has been used by a shoe leather supplier, machine tool firm and other businesses.
Pace initially asked for 180 units on the site when it first lodged plans after purchasing it for $13 million two years ago.
The red brick St Crispin building, just east of Victoria Park railway station, sits at the centre of a large block with adjoining structures on either side and stretching back to Stafford Street.
Pace, run by Shane Wilkinson, will begin off-the-plan sales in late October and expects to start construction later this year, with a completion date set for mid-2019.
Pace's planning manager Michael Holah said the building's design by SJB Architects would "pay homage" to its industrial history and Art Deco influences.
The building will have a mix of one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments, including a gym, rooftop pool and barbecue area.
The group has projects under way in Carnegie, Collingwood, Doncaster East, Northcote and in Sydney Road Brunswick.
