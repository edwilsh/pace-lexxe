  <title>Social media a game changer in 2017 PNG elections</title>
  <content>
During the course of a long, complicated and chaotic election, social media in PNG has come into its own, serving as an important tool for getting information to the people.
That social media coverage has also stoked up plenty of controversy, not least for leading blogger Martyn Namorong, who found himself in the midst of a defamation case brought by the Electoral Commissioner when he took exception to the way he was being described.
But despite that blip, Martyn Namorong, says the power of social media can not be denied, and he points to Facebook, Twitter and other platforms as having a direct impact on the election of at least two MPs.
