  <title>Jodhi Meares cashes in with luxury apartment sale</title>
  <content>
BILLIONAIRE James Packer's favourite ex-wife Jodhi Meares has bought a fisherman's cottage in exclusive waterside Watson's Bay in Sydney's east for $2.75m.
The former swimwear model turned Hawaiian-based activewear designer bought the pretty blue weatherboard house after selling two other Sydney properties, reports.
The purchase comes after the sale of her Point Piper apartment, where she holed up three years ago following a spectacular car crash in which she flipped her luxury Range Rover 4WD.
The drink driving accident preceded Ms Meares' breakup with rock musician Jon Stevens and a failed marriage to photographer Nick Tsindos.
But now happily based in Hawaii and with a new Sydney bolthole, Meares is said to be still close to her first husband James Packer.
The pair were pictured out together several times following the breakdown of his marriage to model Erica Baxter, the mother of his three children.

Ms Meares was also photographed with Packer during his ill-fated romance to superstar singer Mariah Carey.
The fashion entrepreneur's new Sydney house is a heritage-listed 1880s cottage with harbour glimpses.
The two bedroom, one bathroom house is one of nine remaining in the so-called fisherman's cottage group of the original Camp Cove village.
The Tigerlily label founder sold her Point Piper apartment for $2.4m in May.
She paid $1.23 million for the unit in 2004, after her marriage to casino -tycoon Packer ended.
Ms Meares briefly listed the property for sale in 2014, but withdrew it after taking up residence with her then-beau, former Noiseworks frontman Jon Stevens.
The apartment came under siege in June 2014 when Ms Meares rolled her Range Rover and was charged with drink driving.
A media pack camped outside the historic 1907 Danmark building as it was revealed she had been driving more than three times over the legal limit.
Ms Meares pleaded guilty and escaped with a fine and a 12 month licence suspension, her lawyer Chris Murphy saying she had "been punished enough".
Mr Murphy said media pressure after the crash had made Ms Meares want to leave Australia altogether.
Mr Murphy said Ms Meares' two-year marriage to Mr Packer had branded her a celebrity for life.
"It haunts everything that is said about her. She is not a celebrity, she is not a movie star, she is a woman raised by a single mother."
