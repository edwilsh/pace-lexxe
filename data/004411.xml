  <title>Tripping the Wyndham light fantastic</title>

POLICE have created a street dance party for children in Wyndham - and one boy has made the stage his own, becoming a social media sensation.
As 'Strip that Down' by Liam Payne blared out of the speakers, officers turned their emergency lights on, turning a Wyndham street into a disco dance floor.
Several children took the chance to pull out their best dance moves but one oozed cool with his moves - and his sunglasses.
WA Police captioned the post on : "The moment Wyndham Police use the emergency lights to create a street dance party for the local kids.  "
Check out his dance moves in the video above.
