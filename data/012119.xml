  <title>Ex Vic union official fined for contempt</title>
  <content>
A former Victorian union official has been fined $25,000 for contempt of court after refusing to let investigators search his home for evidence of suspected illegal industrial action.
Gregory Thomas Hardy, who works at AGL Energy's Loy Yang Power Station in Victoria and was a former CFMEU secretary, refused to let investigators search his Traralgon home in March for evidence that he organised industrial action that breached the Fair Work Act.
In the Federal Court of Australia on Thursday, Justice David O'Callaghan said Hardy's contempt was "self-evidently, deliberately defiant and contumacious" and fined him $25,000.
