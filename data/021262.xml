  <title>Mayor slams North East toll road routes</title>
  <content>
ROUTES proposed for the North East Link toll road could cost taxpayers $16 billion and should be dumped, according to a Melbourne council.
It is understood four routes are being considered for the "missing link" in Melbourne's northern road network.
However, Nillumbik mayor Peter Clarke said at least two were "obviously not viable".
Northern suburbs councils including Nillumbik, Banyule and Manningham were due to meet with the North East Link Authority today for an update.
Mr Clarke said one of the longer routes joining the EastLink in Ringwood to the Ring Rd through Melbourne's outer-east, via Chirnside Park and Kangaroo Ground, was expected to be too costly.
Rather than wasting it on routes that would not be built money should be spent on -addressing congestion during construction over the next decade, Mr Clarke said.
Premier Daniel Andrews has flagged that a preferred route would be revealed by year's end, for a construction start in 2019.
Opposition Leader Matthew Guy said the government could not be trusted on project costs following the dumping of the East West Link.
