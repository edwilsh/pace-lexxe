  <title>Aussie boxer Lauryn Eagle charged after allegedly testing positive to methamphetamine</title>
  <content>
Professional boxer Lauryn Eagle will front court in September after being charged with drug driving.
The 29-year-old Australian allegedly returned a positive result for methamphetamine on the morning of July 12 during a random drug test in Peakhurst, in Sydney's south.
A second test was administered at Kogarah Police Station, however police were required to wait six weeks before receiving the results.
A NSW Police spokeswoman confirmed to 9news.com.au a 29-year-old woman had since been charged with driving with an illicit drug in her system.
She is due to front Sutherland Local Court on September 26.
Ms Eagle appeared on the TODAY Show last month claiming the positive result was triggered by medication taken to treat narcolepsy and ADHD, as prescribed by her doctor.
Ms Eagle's lawyer Adam Houda has confirmed in a tweet that prescription medications were indeed responsible for the positive result.
