  <title>No more! Klitschko announces boxing retirement</title>
  <content>
FORMER heavyweight world champion Wladimir Klitschko has announced his retirement from boxing.
The 41-year-old Klitschko dominated the heavyweight scene for a decade but lost to Britain's Anthony Joshua in April after being knocked out in the 11th round.
"I never thought I'd have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career, I thank you all from the bottom of my heart," he told his fans in a statement.

"I have achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports."
He said that he had deliberately taken a few weeks to reach a decision "to make sure I had enough distance from the (Joshua) fight at Wembley Stadium."
His retirement dashes a mooted blockbuster rematch with Joshua possibly in Las Vegas in November.
Klitschko, who won super-heavyweight gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, held the unified title from 2006-2015 before losing to Tyson Fury in 2015.
He bows out with a record of 64 wins and five defeats.
