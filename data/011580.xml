  <title>Priority projects for Port Kembla cash</title>
  <content>
Wentworth Street, Port Kembla.

The state government has revealed 10 priority projects to be considered for funding under the latest round of the Port Kembla Community Investment Fund (PKCIF).
The projects - ranging from hall upgrades to environmental rehabilitation projects - will now be considered by the PKCIF assessment committee, ahead of a final determination.

Despite being from opposing parties, Liberal Kiama MP Gareth Ward and Labor's Wollongong MP Paul Scully agreed all 10 projects should receive a share of the cash. 
"Whilst we both considered all projects of very high standard, we applied the assessment criteria as per the guidelines for these projects when making our final recommendations," Mr Ward, who is also the parliamentary secretary for the Illawarra, said.
Mr Scully described the recommendations as "a good list of projects" and hoped "the same spirit of political bipartisanship" would continue for future PKCIF allocations.
The fund was , with an initial offering of $2 million.
Fourteen projects were successful in the PKCIF's first round, with  for its Port Kembla Town Centre Facade Program.
The fund provides an annual allocation of $1 million, which is linked to the 99-year lease of the Port Kembla port.
Environmental, public infrastructure and precinct activation projects are eligible for funding of between $10,000 and $500,000.

Successful round two projects are expected to be announced in coming weeks.
