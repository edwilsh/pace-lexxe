A BOOKISH burglar has been arrested after a bizarre break-in at a Frankston home this morning.
A 35-year-old woman woke to the intruder in her house in Fairway St and immediately fled and called police.
Officers arrived to find the 27-year-old man casually flicking through magazines on the living room mantel piece.
A struggled ensued after he resisted arrest and as a result, a police officer and the offender were injured.
The Frankston man was taken to hospital with a minor facial injury and the police officer was also taken to hospital with a possible forearm injury.
The Frankston man is expected to be interviewed later this morning.
