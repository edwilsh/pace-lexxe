  <title>Hospitals discharged man before he killed</title>
  <content>
A number of busy Melbourne hospitals discharged a mentally unwell and drug-addicted man in the weeks before he fatally stabbed his housemate, a court has been told.
Hugh William Brown, 45, was in June found guilty of murdering his friend Steven Warlond, 43, at the Port Melbourne apartment they shared on June 17 2016.
During a Supreme Court plea hearing on Friday defence lawyer Michael Cahill SC said the ice-addicted Brown was having suicidal and homicidal thoughts in the weeks leading up to the stabbing and admitted himself to hospital several times.
