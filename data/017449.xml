  <title>Swans 'jolted' back to their best: Smith</title>

Nick Smith in action against Geelong at Simonds Stadium

SYDNEY'S impressive 46-point win over Geelong at Simonds Stadium could be the catalyst for the club's charge towards September, according to defender Nick Smith.

The Swans towelled up Geelong for the third-straight time with a dominant win over the Cats, sparked by a seven-goal to two opening quarter that was reminiscent of last year's preliminary final between the sides.

Smith said the importance of bouncing back after a down performance against Hawthorn in a thrilling six-point loss at the MCG a week ago was not lost on anyone at the club.

Leading into the clash against the Hawks, the Swans had won seven games in a row.

"It was really disappointing to play all those weeks of good footy and then come off and it seemed like tonight it's jolted us back into the mindset of, 'We've got to get going again,'" Smith told AFL.com.au

"So hopefully it's a bit of a catalyst for the rest of the year because we've got to come ready to play."

"Last week showed what can happen when we didn't."

Smith was a key part of a Swans defence that kept Geelong - the second-highest scoring team in the AFL - to just 61 points on Friday night.

The Swans have now kept Geelong to 60 points, 60 points and 61 points in their past three meetings, winning on all three occasions.

Heath Grundy, Jarrad McVeigh, Dane Rampe and Smith provide the experience for the Swans, but it has been the emergence of Lewis Melican and Nic Newman that has added a new dimension to the Swans' back six.

"We've got Newman and Melican and we've got a bit of experience down there as well, but they've been blending in quite well," Swans coach John Longmire said.

The Swans have games against Fremantle, Adelaide and Carlton to come over the next three weeks as they look to shore up a spot in September.

Sydney has now won 11 of its past 13 matches after starting the year with an 0-6 win-loss record.

Smith said he is confident the Swans can make a statement in the lead up to another September campaign.

"We think when we're playing good footy we're a hard side to beat," Smith said.
