  <title>Inside the town with a world-first floating wind farm</title>
  <content>
At first thought, Peterhead sounds like a pretty unlikely place to base world-first technology.

It's on Scotland's north-eastern coast, about 45 minutes' drive north of Aberdeen.

It's a pretty sleepy place of around 18,000 people and its main industry is fishing. I'm willing to vouch for the quality of its haddock and chips.

But it's actually perfect.

Past its protected harbour, the North Sea becomes wild and windy - ideal conditions to harness wind power.

But until now the sea has been too deep to install the turbines.

Enter floating turbine technology.  The turbines are 253 metres tall. That's two and a half football fields.

Seventy-eight metres of that sits below the water. It's ballast - that stabilises the turbine like an iceberg.

Then, three anchor lines secure it to the seabed.  They can sit in depths of more than 100 metres, rather than the maximum of around 40 metres for the established offshore wind farms.

It's incredible technology, especially when you consider it has been developed by an oil company!

A whole field of the turbines are being towed over from Norway right now.

A couple have already been installed 25 kilometres off Peterhead, and by the end of August they'll be powering 20,000 homes.

It's a little more expensive than the land-based turbines that are now Scotland's cheapest power source, but costs are coming down fast.

More floating farms are planned off Scotland, England and France, and the technology is described as perfect for the steeper undersea descents off California and Japan.

A representative of Scottish Renewables told me Australia would also be perfect.  Although, who knows with the current political "debate" over climate change policy.

As for what the Scots think?  Well the locals I spoke to were happy to see a few offshore in the distance.

One told me he'd rather see them out to sea than on the local farms.

One thing is for sure: they're huge examples of impressive engineering.

And perhaps a glimpse into the future, in a town that's traditional fresh battered haddock, with some mushy peas and chips, is also worth celebrating.
