WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE ALLEGED TERROR CONSPIRACY:
WHO?
* Two men have been charged - Khaled Mahmoud Khayat, 49, and Mahmoud Khayat, 32
* Another man is still being detained and a fourth was released on Tuesday night without charge
* Police allege one of the charged men began communicating with an Islamic State "controller" overseas in April
* The brother of one is a senior member of IS in Syria and acted as a go-between
WHAT IS ALLEGED?

Related Articles

* Bomb components were sent from Turkey to Sydney by air cargo with the IED assembled here
* Khaled Mahmoud Khayat accompanied an unnamed brother to Sydney's international airport on July 15 with the bomb in his sibling's luggage. The brother had "no idea" about the plot
* For an unknown reason Khayat left the airport with the bomb and his brother flew to Abu Dhabi on an uneventful Etihad flight
* Following the aborted effort the bomb was disassembled
* The IS controller then instructed the accused how to create an "improvised chemical dispersion device" designed to release the highly toxic gas hydrogen sulfide
* Hydrogen sulfide is a colourless, poisonous and flammable gas that can damage lungs and affect breathing
* The men created some components of the chemical bomb but remained "a mile-and-a-half from having a functioning chemical dispersion device"
* Police said there was no indication the chemical device was intended to be used on a plane
KEY DATES
* Australian authorities receive information about the plot on July 26
* It leads to raids across four Sydney suburbs on July 29 and the arrest of the four men
* Khaled Mahmoud Khayat and Mahmoud Khayat face court on August 4 when their case is adjourned to November 14
