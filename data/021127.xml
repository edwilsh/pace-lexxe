  <title>Clothes dryer ignites house fire</title>
  <content>
A Waratah house was significantly damaged in a blaze on Sunday night.

About 6.50pm emergency services were called to a home in Tighe Street, following reports of a fire.
Officers from Fire and Rescue NSW extinguished the blaze, which caused significant structural damage to the property. No one was at home at the time and there were no injuries as a result of the fire.
Initial investigations suggest the fire began with an electric clothes dryer that was operating on the back deck of the premises.
