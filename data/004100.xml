  <title>Essendon woman celebrates lotto win</title>
  <content>
A HARDWORKING woman from Essendon is planning a trip of a lifetime to Europe after winning more than $300,000 from Tattslotto.
The woman, who purchased her ticket from the Moonee Ponds Central Newsagency, plans to use her $329,266.60 winnings to pay off her house, and jet off to Europe in style.
She was unaware of her division one win, as she had not registered her entry to a Tatts Card, and was pleasantly surprised to hear of her win from a Tatts official.
"I only found out that I had won something when I checked my ticket when I put my entry in for the weekend's superdraw, but didn't know how much," the winner said.
"Then I went home and checked the numbers and I said to my husband - 'Oh my God, it's six numbers'.
"I was really surprised."
The holiday will be long overdue for the woman and her husband as they have spent the last four years starting and working hard at their own business.
"We are self-employed and have started our own business, and we haven't had any holidays for about five years now so we are definitely looking forward to that," she said.
