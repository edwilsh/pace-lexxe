  <title>Tassie hand in A-League club's defeat</title>
  <content>
FORMER South Hobart striker Kostas Kanakaris is loving life at Heidelberg United - and why wouldn't he be?
Kanakaris has become the first Tasmanian to help an NPL club defeat an A-League outfit in the FFA Cup.
Kanakaris, now a winger, started in the NPL Victoria side's historic 1-0 defeat of A-League side Perth Glory in the FFA Cup round of 32.
It is just the fourth time a semi-professional NPL club has defeated a professional A-League side in the FFA Cup.
Heidelberg joins the likes of Adelaide City who defeated Western Sydney Wanderers in 2014, as well as 2016 giant killers Redlands United (Queensland) and Green Gully (Victoria), which ousted Adelaide United and Central Coast, respectively.
Kanakaris said it was thrilling to become the first Tasmanian to take part in an A-League side's downfall in the cup, with a spot in the round of 16 now awaiting.
"It was a great win and just so good to get through," he said.
"We knew it was going to be a hard game. We've been working on this all season."
Kanakaris joined United in 2014 after some stellar performances with South in the former Victory League. In May 2013, the marksman hit Australia's fastest hat-trick in two minutes and 51 seconds during South's 11-0 drubbing of Launceston City.
The attacker said he would still play in the A-League if the opportunity arose, but added it would be difficult. "It's hard as they don't believe in NPL players," he said.
United leads South Melbourne on the NPL Victoria ladder by three points with three games to play. The club also claimed the statewide Dockerty Cup last month, defeating Bentleigh Greens on penalties in the final.
Kanakaris said he is well settled into the side.
"We still have a few games to go but with a couple more wins we will win the premiership this season," Kanakaris said. "I'm happy here now, I won't come back to Tassie."
