  <title>Coast's 5 most trusted vets, as decided by readers</title>
  <content>
THE Sunshine Coast Daily has found the five most popular veterinary practices across the region, as nominated and voted by readers.
More than 300 people nominated their most trusted vet on the Daily's Facebook page, with more than 40 clinics nominated.
The final poll on the Daily's website attracted 761 votes.
1. Battery Hill Veterinary Clinic: 203 votes
This small clinic earned first place with 26% of the final vote.
Dr Ernie Young opened Battery Hill Veterinary Clinic in October 2015, and has since become a trusted veterinarian.
Nominator Michelle Cole said the practice was the only one she would entrust her "fur babies" with, and the vets were "very professional, caring" and had "a special way with animals".
2. Nicklin Way Veterinary Surgery: 179 votes
This Warana practice, earning 23% of the vote, is owned by local veterinarians Dr Doug Gray and Dr Melanie Irvine. Established in 1989, the practice has grown with a team of seven doctors and 10 nurses.
3. The Natural Vets: 172 votes
The Natural Vets practice took 22% of the final vote and is a holistic pet health clinic at Forest Glen, with four veterinarians and five nurses.
Nominator Ben O'Duhring said the practice was the best on the Coast.
"We love how they seamlessly integrate traditional western medicine with alternative therapies," he said.
"Dr Henry has been practising on the Coast for nearly 40 years and has an incredible reputation for healing animals when other vets were simply managing symptoms."
4. Blanck Street Veterinary Surgery: 72 votes
This Maroochydore clinic took 9% of the vote.
Practice owner Dr David Dawe purchased the clinic in 1994, with the small practice employing one further vet and three nurses.
Nominator Jennifer Forster said the vets at the clinic went above and beyond for the animals.
"They've saved both our precious kitties and Dave has even been known to sleep on the floor beside his patients," she said.
5. Marcoola Veterinary Surgery: 31 votes
Dr Brad Sultmann has owned this clinic since 1990, and has become a community favourite as the practice's sole veterinarian working alongside nurse Katrina Sultmann.
The surgery earned 4% of the vote, just edging out the Palmwoods Veterinary Clinic and the Bli Bli Vet on 3% each.
