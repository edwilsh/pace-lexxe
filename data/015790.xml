  <title>These amazing colorized photographs bring World War I to life</title>
  <content>
One month after a Bosnian-Serb assassinated Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, on a street corner in Sarajevo, the Austro-Hungarian Empire on
July 28, 1914 declared war on Serbia, effectively beginning World War I.

Ferdinand's murder sent the Great Powers into a war that would last five years and cost the lives of 10 million troops.

Thought of as the "war to end all wars," World War I marked a number of firsts in military conflict, including the use of planes, tanks, and chemical weapons.

On June 28, 1919, the victorious Allied leaders signed the Treaty of Versailles,  and spurring German nationalism, which in turn gave Nazi leader Adolf Hitler a political platform.

Here's a few colorized photographs published by  showing life during World War I.
