  <title>Roar icon Broich lands first coaching gig</title>
  <content>
BRISBANE Roar legend Thomas Broich has linked with A-League aspirants Brisbane City.
In the first step to perhaps becoming City's first A-League coach should the club gain entry into an expanded national competition, Broich will work with the NPL Queensland club's juniors, be mentored by first-team coach John Kosmina and help shape City's football department.
With the support of City, the 36-year-old two-time Johnny Warren Medallist will return to his native Germany next month to start the process of earning UEFA coaching qualifications.
Broich, who had ankle surgery on Thursday, still isn't ready to ready to announce his playing retirement after not offered a new deal by the Roar at the end of last season.
But he's happy to start his coaching career and will be content to hang up his boots if a playing offer doesn't come his way.
"This is a big opportunity that City have offered me," Broich said.
"I'm super excited about it. It has been a real thrill to engage with so many talented kids in nightly coaching sessions from Brisbane City's academy, NPL teams and joining a session alongside John Kosmina's first team.
"I am really looking forward to be able to contribute to the growth of junior skills and technical development at the club and across the wider game in Australia."
Broich said the Roar would always have a place in heart, but hoped City would eventually join his former club in the A-League.
"Brisbane deserves a second A-League and I'm really impressed with City's bid," he said.
"We've seen in Sydney and Melbourne how having a second team in the city also helps the existing club in that city, and it would be the same here."
City's A-League bid chairman Robert Cavallucci was delighted to get Roar hall-of-famer Broich on board.
"Thomas's exceptional footwork is matched by an exceptional football brain, and I am thrilled that the boys and girls of Brisbane City will experience the benefits of his extraordinary career," Cavallucci said.
"I am equally thrilled that as a club, Brisbane City is able to support Thomas as his career takes a new path."
City president David Asnicar said Broich's involvement in "nurturing" the club's players would "further cement our contribution to growing the beautiful game in Australia".
