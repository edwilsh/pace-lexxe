  <title>Suspected tornado hits Perth's north</title>
  <content>
A suspected tornado has ripped through Perth's north, with wind gusts of more than 110 km/h damaging buildings and trees, and knocking out power to thousands of homes.
The Bureau of Meteorology said it lasted about 10 minutes and moved through the suburbs of Sorrento, Duncraig, Warwick, Hamersley and Balga about 11.10am on Monday.
At 4.30pm, more than 3600 homes in the metropolitan area were without power.
The heaviest downpours were in Karnet and Bickley, where rainfall of around 25mm was recorded between 9am and 4.40pm.
Tornadoes can occur two to three times each winter in the metropolitan area, the BoM says.
