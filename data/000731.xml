  <title>Batman thief caught on camera</title>
  <content>
A BATMAN-loving thief has been captured on camera using a stolen credit card at several shopping centres in Melbourne's east.
Whitehorse detectives are investigating the thefts after a vehicle parked on Morack Rd in Vermont was ransacked sometime between 8am on June 8 and 6pm on June 9.
A wallet belonging to the owner, a 64-year-old man, was stolen from the centre console.
The man's credit card was later used at places including multiple retailers at the Forest Hill Chase shopping centre on the corner of Canterbury and Mahoneys roads.
The items purchased ranged from lamps and hats to food and cigarettes.
The card was then used again at Eastland in Ringwood between midday and 12.20pm, and again at shops in Mitchamjust after 2pm.
Police have released images of a man they believe may be able to assist with their inquiries.
The Batman hat pictured in the photo was believed to have been purchased with the stolen credit card at a Forest Hill outlet.
Anyone with information is urged to phone Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit a confidential report at
