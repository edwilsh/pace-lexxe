Steve Fesus spoke about giving away his teenage wife's clothes to charities only two days after he told people she had disappeared from their Mount Warrigal home, a jury has been told.
"His intention to give her clothes away within two days indicates he knew she would not be returning or would not need her clothes or other belongings," prosecutor Greg Smith SC said in the Crown opening address on Monday.

Fesus, 46, has pleaded not guilty in the NSW Supreme Court to murdering Jodie Fesus, 18, in August 1997 at their home, before burying her body in a shallow grave at Seven Mile Beach, near Gerroa.
