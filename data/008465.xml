The high-profile barrister who claimed responsibility for the $50,000 in cash former Ipswich mayor Paul Pisasale was stopped with at Melbourne Airport says his friend should have thrown his hat back in the city's mayoral contest, despite his illness and an extortion charge.
Brisbane-based lawyer Sam Di Carlo launched a spirited defence of the former councillor outside court on Wednesday after being fined $4000 for an Photo: Darren England/AAP
"I don't know how much the CCC has spent on Paul Pisasale but there's an absolute determination, whether it's political or otherwise, to do whatever they can towards him," Mr Di Carlo said.
"And coincidentally it happens to be, things tend to come out.
"For example, all the stuff that came out on the weekend happened to be the last day where he could have nominated."
Mr Pisasale is subject to a wide-ranging Crime and Corruption Commission investigation, which include allegations revealed by Fairfax Media that he  and

he had asked Mr Pisasale to carry the cash for him to help complete an unrelated Supreme Court settlement involving a former fugitive client and alleged fraudster.
The money was supposedly to pay off a debt the client, Hui "Martin" Tian, owed a Brisbane couple but the intended recipients have told  it was "just an excuse" and a settlement had not been reached.

On Wednesday, Mr Di Carlo stood by his explanation, saying his request for Mr Pisasale to carry the money "could have been better thought out".
"It was just so innocent that I just didn't even think it out," he said.
"I mean that was the thing about it, it was just such a stupid thing.
"You think 'why on earth would I have done that?' and I'm sure he thinks the same thing."
Mr Di Carlo said he thought Mr Pisasale was going to nominate for mayor before the weekend's allegations were aired.
"I encouraged him to. I think the people should judge him, not anybody else," he said.
"And I think he should have gone out there and said listen 'I'm going to run because I still have the passion. I still can do the job.
"When I get better I will be there, and I will do as best I can and if I'm found guilty or if you people judge me then I'm happy to follow your judgement because you're the people I've served and I've served well'."
Mr Di Carlo said nothing excused wrongful conduct but maintained his friend was only facing allegations and it was "unAustralian" to kick someone while they were down.
"I really think it's time they let him go," he said.
"He's done such a wonderful job for that city. I don't know, at the end of the day, even if everything that's said about him is true, imagine the pressure he's been under for the last couple of years.
"He's worked 18 hours a day, seven days a week. He has the most amazing relationship with, I think, the media, the public.
"I've seen people walk up to him and just want to have a photo with him and he never says no to anybody. He's so kind and so passionate to people but he's human."
, a day after the CCC raided his council office and home, wearing a dressing gown and citing a deterioration in his long-running battle with multiple sclerosis.
He was not among on Tuesday.
Mr Pisasale has been charged with extortion and two other charges, unrelated to the $50,000 cash, which he said he intended to fight.
