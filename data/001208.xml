  <title>SA woman admits to racist rant on bus</title>
  <content>
A woman who went on a racist rant on an Adelaide bus engaged in behaviour that "cannot be condoned in a civilised society", a court has heard.
Stacey Marie Thomason pleaded guilty to an abusive language charge in the Adelaide Magistrates Court in relation to the verbal attack on a woman and her young child on a bus in November last year.
In sentencing Thomason to 200 hours of community service work on Monday, Magistrate David McLeod said the 31-year-old had directed a racial slur at an Asian woman and had also called her a "f*****g c***" in front of other passengers.
