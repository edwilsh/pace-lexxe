  <title>Former union boss in court</title>
  <content>
FORMER union boss Dave Hanna has appeared in court for the first time charged with destroying documents in the lead-up to the $46 million royal commission into trade unions.
Hanna's appearance was brief and the case was adjourned to October 6.
The Brisbane Magistrates Court was told there was "a box full and three binders" of material to be handed to his defence lawyers today.
The ex-union boss, 52, was in June issued with a summons in relation to "destroying documents or other things" between April 1 and 4, 2014.
It comes almost two years after the Royal Commission into Union Governance and Corruption heard revelations that seven tonnes of paperwork was taken away from the CFMEU's Bowen Hills office, attempted to be burned, and later dumped at a landfill.
The inquiry was told the documents were removed on the same day the then-new royal commission issued a "notice to produce" documents.
