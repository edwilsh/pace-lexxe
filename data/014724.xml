JOBS: Minster for Defence Industry Christopher Pyne.

A $145 million Defence maintenance contract that will employee about 80 people in the Hunter has been extended until 2021.

Boeing Defence Australia's contract for the F/A-18A Hornet aircraft fleet has been extended to include engineering, logistics and maintenance sustainment support. 

Defence says the "expanded commercial arrangement" will see support for Australia's fleet of 71 Classic Hornets extended out until December 2021, with an option for further extension.
Minster for Defence Industry Christopher Pyne said the contract extension will help sustain "dozens of jobs in the Hunter".
"It will secure ongoing employment for approximately 80 additional workers based in [the] Newcastle and Hunter regions of New South Wales," Mr Pyne said in a statement.
"This contract amendment expands the volume of work and continues a highly successful partnership with Boeing Defence Australia and its subcontractors."
"As well as securing continued support for Australia's air combat capability, this revised arrangement will restructure Classic Hornet aircraft support to align with the First Principles Review outcomes and allow Defence to redirect resources to transition support to newer capabilities, like the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter and EA-18G Growler," said Minister Pyne.
