  <title>Is this the end for Mitchell?</title>
  <content>
SAM Mitchell is expected to make a call on his playing future at a press conference tomorrow morning.
Mitchell is tipped to retire from playing at the end of the season to start his full-time assistant coaching duties at West Coast.
The 34-year-old was a four-time premiership player with the Hawks before joining the Eagles late last year from Hawthorn in a shock recruiting move.
With 323 games under his belt, Mitchell is one of the most decorated players in the game, with a Brownlow Medal (2012), five Hawthorn best-and-fairest awards (2006, 2009, 2011-12, 2016) and three All Australian jumpers (2011, 2013, 2015).

Sam Mitchell retiring tomorrow.

Mitchell has been one of the Eagles' most consistent players, and has averaged 27 disposals this year.
Mitchell's expected retirement comes amid mounting pressure on West Coast coach Adam Simpson to turn to youth, with the Eagles sporting the oldest list in the competition.
He will be the second Brownlow medallist to retire within a week, with teammate Matt Priddis calling time on his career on Friday.
