  <title>Queensland journalists allegedly underpaid more than $300,000</title>
  <content>
A Queensland digital media company will front the Federal Circuit Court over allegations it underpaid young journalists more than $300,000 over a 17-month period.
The Fair Work Ombudsman claims Touchpoint Media Pty Ltd "frequently" underpaid or failed to pay journalists for work that featured on several regionally aligned news websites at Charters Towers, Charleville, Goondiwindi, Longreach, Maranoa, Redland and Whitsundays.Photo: Michel O'Sullivan
The websites are owned by another company related to Laurence Bernard Ward, who is the company director of Touchpoint Media Pty Ltd, FWO claims.
Touchpoint Media began in 2012 as a "think tank" to "localise" the internet, according to the company website.
It is alleged 23 journalists, some of which were in their early 20s and had been recruited straight out of university, were underpaid $305,780 between January 2015 and June 2016.
FWO claims of the 23 journalists underpaid, four were underpaid more than $30,000 each while one journalist was allegedly underpaid $48,217.

FWO inspectors started their investigation into the company and Mr Ward after workers lodged requests for assistance.
During the investigation, the company and Mr Ward allegedly provided false PAYG records to the inspectors that "significantly overstated" employee payments, according to the FWO.

Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said legal action has been taken because of the alleged "blatant underpayment" of the workers.
"Allegations regarding inexperienced young workers who are committed to working hard to build careers is extremely disappointing and cannot be tolerated," Ms James said.
Touchpoint Media Pty Ltd faces penalties of up to $54,000 per contravention, while Mr Ward faces penalties of up to $10,800 per contravention.
The matter has been listed for a penalty hearing in the Federal Circuit Court in Brisbane on March 2018.
Fairfax Media approached Touchpoint Media for comment.
