  <title>Release shooting calls: Vic club owner</title>
  <content>
The owner of a Melbourne nightclub where heavily armed police shot a couple at a fancy dress swingers party has demanded police release the triple zero calls that alleged the man's toy gun was real.
Martha Tsamis on Thursday also confirmed she has been in a relationship with senior Victoria Police Detective Inspector Phil Harrison since 2010, and said top brass have always known about the couple.
Taking to Facebook, Ms Tsamis said police should release the calls from people allegedly concerned about the man's toy gun, which was part of his costume as The Joker at the July party.
