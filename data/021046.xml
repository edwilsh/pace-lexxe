  <title>Public housing rent to be auto deducted</title>
  <content>
Public housing tenants will no longer be able to run up huge debts under a new federal government plan to automatically deduct rent from welfare payments.
Around 9000 social housing renters owe more than three weeks' rent, while thousands more lose their public housing every year because of rental arrears, News Corp Australia reports.
Human Services Minister Alan Tudge says Australia's social housing systems are out of pocket than $30 million a year from unpaid rent and the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme will prevent people falling behind, while allowing the development of more social housing.
