  <title>How to nail that job interview</title>
  <content>
YOU'VE applied for the job and you've been called in for an interview - congratulations.

They are obviously impressed with your experience and skills and now it's time to back it up with a stellar interview performance.

Here are some ways you will smash it and impress your interviewers.

Get a good night's sleep: This might seem obvious, but nerves definitely can keep us awake all night. You do not want to turn up tired and yawn throughout the interview.

Plus you want to be on your A-game when answering questions, and tiredness can interfere with that.

Be well presented: Find out what the company's dress code is before going to your interview. Although you want to match the recommended attire of the company, if in doubt, go more formal than casual.

Don't forget to take a shower, wear deodorant, but skip the strong perfume or cologne. If you wear make-up, keep it natural.

Practise your handshake: A good handshake is firm, but not too strong. Try and match the person whose hand you are shaking as a good guide. Make sure your nails are clean and tidy.

Be punctual: Aim to arrive at least 15 minutes before your interview time.

If you are driving, know exactly where you can park your car, or if you are taking public transport, know how long it takes from the station/stop to where you will be interviewed.

Being a little early gives a good impression and shows that you respect your interviewer's time.

Research the company: You need to know a little about the company before you go in for an interview. Having no idea about what the company does shows a lack of interest and initiative.

A quick read of the company's website, a Google search and social media search is easy to do.

Be prepared: Before the interview, review the job outline and identify any areas where your skills may be weaker.

This will give you the opportunity to plan how to answer any tricky questions and turn your weaknesses around into strengths. It is so important to know your resume/CV back to front.
