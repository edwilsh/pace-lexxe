  <title>Search finds no trace of slain Qld teen</title>
  <content>
An extensive search of bush west of Brisbane has uncovered no trace of slain teenager Tiffany Taylor.
Acting on a tip off, a search party of around 40 emergency rescue and police officers scoured dense bushland and difficult terrain near Banks Creek Road in Fernvale on Saturday but no evidence of the 16-year-old was found.
A 60-year-old man has been charged with Tiffany's murder, but two years later her body remains missing.
