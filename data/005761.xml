Dustin Martin's manager says the Richmond star is likely to decide his future ahead of the finals

DUSTIN Martin's manager has indicated the Richmond superstar and Brownlow Medal favourite could make a decision on his future during the break between round 23 and the finals.

Martin is out of contract and his management has maintained the restricted free agent would address his future at the end of the season.

With Richmond sitting fourth on the ladder with 12 wins and destined for a September campaign, his decision could come at the end of the home-and-away season and before finals.  

"He always said at the end of the season. I dare say that's at the end of the home-and-away season, I would think," Martin's manager Ralph Carr told Fairfax Media.

"It's in Dustin's court. I am sure at the right time he will say to me: 'Right, we are ready, let's review it'.

"Dustin said he would deal with it at the end of the year. I am really just honouring his request.

"At the moment we are doing just what we should be doing as a manager, that is seeing it through as per Dustin's request." 

Martin, the overwhelming Brownlow Medal favourite after the suspension of Geelong superstar Patrick Dangerfield, has played magnificent football in 2017 despite the constant speculation around his playing future.

His form has allowed Richmond to be comfortable with the ongoing negotiations, as well as the fact Martin is a restricted free agent and the club has the option of matching any offer for their brilliant midfielder. 

While Martin has been linked to North Melbourne in a lucrative long-term deal, Carr said he had "not spoken to a soul about Dustin" and speculation about his future was "the usual crap that is going on with this sort of stuff".

He declined to address questions about Richmond's offer and whether the Tigers needed to offer a more lucrative contract to ensure they didn't lose their 2016 club champion.

No free agent has made public their decision to leave before the end of their original club's finals campaign. Gary Ablett (2010), Lance Franklin (2013) and Patrick Dangerfield (2015) were all widely expected to seek free agency moves but none actually made it official before their teams had been eliminated from the flag race.
