  <title>Southport Spit $3b casino resort canned by Queensland Government</title>
  <content>
A proposed $3-billion Gold Coast casino resort development on the Southport Spit has been rejected by the Queensland Government following several months of community consultation.

Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told the Gold Coast City Council this morning, and then announced the decision, saying a new master plan would be developed to preserve the area for future generations.
The Chinese ASF consortium had proposed to build a mega casino resort complex, arguing it would create 13,000 jobs and inject more than $700 million into the local economy.
More to come.
