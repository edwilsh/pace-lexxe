A MODERN Mt Martha pad, multi-million dollar East Melbourne manor and Mitcham family house have been revealed as the most popular homes offered for sale in Victoria this year.
The diverse trio make up the state's most-viewed listings on realestate.com.au to the end of July - and accordingly provide a glimpse into househunters' wishlists.

56 Finlayson Ave, Mt Martha sold for $1.85m: 40,611 views.

50 Hotham St, East Melbourne for sale for $11m-$12m: 31,232 views.

Realestate.com.au chief economist Nerida Conisbee said houses with either an affordable price tag or wow factor typically attracted the most attention online.
The new 56 Finlayson Ave in Mt Martha attracted more than 40,000 views in its 27 days on the market, before selling for $1.85 million in February. Eview Group Joel Hood Property agent Adrian Calcedo said the five-bedroom home's quality build and bay views lured dozens of prospective buyers.
A buyer could still fulfil the dream of snapping up -Victoria's second-most viewed residence of the year - Shrewsbury House at 50 Hotham St, East Melbourne, remains for sale via Marshall White Armadale, with an $11-$12 million price guide.

5A Merilyn Way Frankston South sold for $2.2m: 28,249 views.

6 Oxford St, Collingwood for sale for $5.8-$6.38m: 28,028 views.

70 Quarry Rd Mitcham sold for just over $1.4m: 27,730 views.

23 Coppin Rd Sorrento sold for more than $3m: 27,481 views.

The 1886 gothic revival mansion sprawls across four levels and is the suburb's largest single residential landholding on 1090sq m.
Three family houses in Mitcham also feature in the top 10 list, led by "character weatherboard" 11 Dawe Rd, which racked up about 29,500 views before fetching $1.71 million.
Buyers Justine and Richard weren't surprised to hear their new five-bedroom home garnered so much attention.
"There were more than 100 people at the auction," Justine recalled.
"We were relieved to get it. It's our dream home."

102 Graham St Albert Park sold for $2.155m: 26,984 views.

145 Edward Rd, Chirnside Park for sale for $7m-$7.7m: 24,403 views.

Noel Jones Mitcham selling agent Matthew Scafidi also listed Mitcham's two other entrants: 70 Quarry Rd, which sold for about $1.4 million in June, and House Rules expert Carolyn Burns-McCrave's home at 6 Rosstrevor Cres, which is being "rested" from the market.
Also making the list were a $2.2 million Frankston South gem at 5A Merilyn Way and architect Ilana Kister's church conversion at 6 Oxford St, which is on the market for $5.8-$6.38 million.
Victoria's most-viewed apartment was a two bedder at 915/39 Lonsdale St in the CBD.
