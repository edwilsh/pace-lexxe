  <title>Assisted dying debate set for parliament</title>
  <content>
Victorian MPs are returning to parliament for the first time since the Andrews government announced it will draft laws giving the terminally ill a say on when they die.
Premier Daniel Andrews hopes to see a conscience vote on the scheme, which he says will be the "safest" in the world, by the end of this year.
The Labor government has endorsed all 66 recommendations made by an expert panel charged with investigating an assisted-dying scheme, however not all within the government will vote for the laws.
Mr Andrews' deputy, James Merlino, has long said he does not support euthanasia and reaffirmed his position during the winter break.
