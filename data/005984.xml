  <title>Shark warning over whale carcass in Perth</title>
  <content>
A shark warning has been issued after a whale carcass washed up at a beach in Perth's outer north.
The whale carcass was found on Tuesday afternoon about one kilometre south of Yanchep.
"It is possible the carcass will act as an attractant that could lead to sharks coming close in to shore along this stretch of coast," authorities warn.
