  <title>Wallaroos players to receive personal grants of $1000 ahead of Women's Rugby World Cup</title>
  <content>
Wallaroos players will have a degree of financial support at the upcoming Women's Rugby World Cup thanks to $1000 payments that have been donated by Buildcorp's co-founder Josephine Sukkar. 
The national women's XVs program is kept afloat by the Australian Rugby Union and is understood to cost the game's governing body about $500,000 per year.

Crusaders power into Super Rugby final

the back of a defensive masterclass and slick finishing by the hosts, the Crusaders have moved past the Chiefs into the Super Rugby grand final.

The majority of Wallaroos players, aside from a handful of Australian sevens representatives, will not be paid by the ARU to represent their country at the World Cup, which gets underway on August 9 in Ireland. 
The ARU pays for accommodation, flights, food and all other expenses associated with an overseas trip, but stops short of handing out match payments or any salary for that matter, because of the amateur status of women's XVs.  

The reason is because there is little return on investment for the ARU given they do not get a slice of the broadcast revenue. 
Most female players have had to take annual leave for the tournament and some will not be paid for close to a month. 

However, Buildcorp principal and co-founder Sukkar, who is also the president of Australian Women's Rugby, has offered her support by providing grants of $1000 to each player in the squad.

The $1000 donations are in addition to the $200,000 the Australian Rugby Foundation handed over last month, which will go towards funding the program as a whole. 
Although the sum of $1000 is significantly less than what sevens and other male rugby athletes receive, the grant was warmly received by players at a farewell event in Sydney on Tuesday. 
"In reality the ARU are like any other sports body in that they're stretched financially and there's only so much money they've got," Sukkar said.
"We just didn't want players over there thinking about their financial commitments and obligations. We wanted them to really apply their minds to rugby and playing the best rugby they can play. Hopefully it make a bit of a difference to them." 
Wallaroos captain Shannon Parry said money was not a factor for players and assured that passion would come through when the team took to the field. 
"They [teammates] have to take leave without pay and not many people would do that in the economy that we're in," Parry said. "So for these girls this jersey means a lot and for them to give up money to be able to represent their country."
Coach Paul Verrell agreed, saying: "They're here to wear the Wallaroos jersey. They'll bring passion, they're very proud to be there. They understand the Wallaroo history and what it's taken to get them to that position. I think they'll draw on that." 
The team were presented with their jerseys and departed on Tuesday afternoon, giving them a full week to prepare in Ireland before their first match on August 10 against the host nation. 
Australia take on Ireland, France and Japan in the pool matches and have their sights set on making it through to the last four despite a string of poor recent results. 
The team struggled on a trip to New Zealand in June, going down to England (53-10), New Zealand (44-17) and Canada (45-5) but Verrell is hopeful of a big showing in the first hit-out against Ireland. 
"We've just got to try and block out the crowd," Verrell said. "The girls will be ready to go. We've seen enough of them that we've definitely got the capabilities of beating them, we've just got to stick to our game plan. 
"There would be nothing better than for us to knock off Ireland in the first Test and I definitely think that will be well-received back here in Australia. This is one of the best preparations we've had and there is no excuses for us." 
Parry said the Wallaroos would embrace their underdog tag at a tournament they have never won, with their best result being a third placing at the 2010 World Cup. 
"Teams haven't seen a lot of us," Parry said. "We've got a lot of intel and analysis that's been done on those Six Nations teams. 
"We are going in there as underdogs and we're not shying away from that but that's something that all Aussie teams thrive off. The only pressure we put on ourselves is that; the pressure I put on myself. 
"For us, all the pressure is on them [Ireland]. We've got to get out early, control that crowd and anything can happen out there."
