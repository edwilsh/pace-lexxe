  <title>Abuse redress scheme heads to parliament</title>
  <content>
Laws to provide money, counselling and personal responses to victims of institutional child sexual abuse will go to federal parliament in the spring sittings.
A national scheme with states, territories and non-government institutions able to join on a "'responsible entity pays" basis was a key recommendation of the royal commission.
Redress under the scheme will have three parts: a payment of up to $150,000, psychological counselling and a direct personal response and acknowledgement from the responsible institution.
