  <title>Berejiklian faces another byelection test after Hodgkinson quits</title>

Premier Gladys Berejiklian faces yet another byelection within weeks, after Nationals MP Katrina Hodgkinson announced her retirement from parliament.

Ms Hodgkinson has been in the parliament for 18 years, including as the minister for small business and the first female minister for primary industries.
Last year she was an outspoken opponent of the government aborted bid to ban greyhound racing.
Ms Hodgkinson's seat of Cootamundra is held on a margin of 20.4 per cent, but the Nationals will be nervous about a challenge from the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party, which stook the seat of Orange from the party in a byelection last year.
"It's been a really challenging couple of years," Ms Hodgkinson told Fairfax Media.

"Every government faces its share of issue. It's wonderful to be in government but I feel the time is right to undertake some succession planning within the seat of Cootamundra and I would hope that as many members as possible who think they can do the job the community expects of them put their names forward to be preselected."
Ms Hodgkinson said any suggestion her decision was a vote of no confidence in Nationals leader John Barilaro or Ms Berejiklian was "blatantly untrue".
"I've had several discussions with both Gladys and John about this," she said. "They have both been very kind, because this is not an easy decision. Gladys and John have both been very generous."
Ms Hodgkinson predicted "a Melbourne Cup field" would line up for preselection, noting the electorate covers 35,000 square kilometres.
The decision follows two byelections in the seats of North Sydney and Manly earlier this year which saw significant swings against the government.
