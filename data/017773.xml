  <title>Bid to find location of Jessica Gaudie's remains</title>
  <content>
THE thin gravel strip, about 12km south of Kenilworth in the Sunshine Coast hinterland, winds through a patchwork of farms before hitting an area accessible only by four-wheel-drive, beyond which lies lush rainforest and pristine mountain streams in the vast Conondale National Park and adjoining state forests.

Derek Sam, sitting in the back of the police car, was no stranger to the serene pocket of countryside - once he'd known every curve of the road, but it had been years since he'd been there, the reports.

Sam is a convicted killer serving a life sentence for the 1999 murder of Nambour schoolgirl Jessica Gaudie. -Detectives had plucked him from his cell at Lotus Glen Correctional Centre, near Mareeba in far north Queensland, and brought him 1600km south to his old stomping ground -because they suspected Sam was the rarest and most dang-erous breed of criminal: a serial killer.

Somewhere nearby, police believe, Sam may have hidden the bodies of three people: Gaudie, whose remains have never been found; British backpacker Celena Bridge, who was last seen on Booloumba Creek Rd in July 1998; and Kenilworth teacher's aide and mother-of-two Sabrina Ann Glassop (commonly known as Ann), who vanished from the same road in May 1999.
