  <title>West New Britain women's health NGO wants to halve cervical cancer rate</title>
  <content>
A locally organised NGO in Papua New Guinea's West New Britain province is aiming to cut the incidence of cervical cancer in the area by half within five years.
That ambitious goal has been set by the Wantok Health Foundation, which was founded by local women who wanted to take action on women's health issues.
One of them, Annette Ketalu, tells Bruce Hill they've received a lot of help from local organisations and testing kits from a laboratory in Australia, Victoria Cytology Services.
