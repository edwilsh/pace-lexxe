  <title>Refugee on Manus Island found dead</title>
  <content>
A refugee in Australia's immigration detention network on Manus Island has died, with local police suggesting the man may have taken his own life.

The man was understood to be an Iranian refugee who had a history of mental illness. Manus provincial police commander David Yapu said a crime scene had been established.
Details including the precise time and location of the death were not yet clear, but the refugee was understood to have been ordinarily living at the Refugee Transit Centre in East Lorengau.
Australia's Department of Immigration and Border Protection has been contacted for comment.
According to Iranian refugee and journalist Behrouz Boochani, who is also on Manus Island, the refugee concerned had a long history of mental illness and distress.
He was  at the regional processing centre, but was released, only to be found wandering the streets of Lorengau without clothes.
"He was homeless in the street and in a very bad situation," Mr Boochani told Fairfax Media on Monday.
"He was very sick for [a] long time but Australia did not provide medical treatment for him."
