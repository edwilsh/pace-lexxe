  <title>Strikers embrace old favourite</title>
  <content>
AS cricket™s pay dispute concludes, the heat is on the Adelaide Strikers™ recruiting - with spearhead Kane Richardson, skipper Brad Hodge and Jon Holland gone and star Ben Dunk set to follow.

However, former Australian batsman Callum Ferguson is contemplating a shock return as the Strikers move to shore up their list and atone for a disappointing sixth Big Bash League finish in 2016-17.

The resolution of protracted, nine-month negotiations between Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers' Association will open the way for BBL franchises to complete rosters.

Ferguson, 32, has spent the past three seasons with Melbourne Renegades but is now fielding strong interest from his home town.

Keeper-batsman Dunk was the competition's top scorer, with 364 runs at 52, last summer after completing a sensational trade that sent Hamish Kingston to Hobart Hurricanes.

Dunk says he thrived under Strikers head coach Jason Gillespie - winning an Australian recall at No.3 against Sri Lanka last February. But family commitments could prevent a return to Adelaide.

"I had a fantastic time in Adelaide. I have a son who is five months old, so we have to weigh up what is best for us and my cricket," Dunk said.

Rising Redbacks keeper Alex Carey should keep the Strikers' gloves, with Tim Ludeman exiting. Travis Head could be named captain, pending national commitments, after Adelaide axed T20 mastermind and former Test batsman Hodge.

The Strikers' spin stocks are threadbare, with Australian left-arm tweaker Holland let go. Adelaide would love to welcome back England leg-spinner Adil Rashid but that depends on his availability. West Indian Kieron Pollard has been cut.

Richardson is pondering a fresh start - possibly at Melbourne Renegades. A 140km/h Australian paceman who is handy down the order will be hard to replace.

Redbacks and Renegades batsman Tom Cooper is attracting several offers.

Adelaide hosts Brisbane Heat in a New Year's double-header and opens its 10-game campaign on December 22 against Sydney Thunder.
