  <title>Labor's 'war on the rich' is firing blanks</title>
  <content>
Last week, I may have sounded a little sceptical about the idea that Labor was going to crack down on the use of discretionary trusts for tax avoidance.
: "I'll believe Labor is prepared to get really serious about family trusts when I see it."

Labor's 'war on the rich' - not

Bill Shortenas big announcement actually cements the use of discretionary trusts as excellent vehicles for tax minimisation. Michael Pascoe comments.

I need not have worried. It turns out  in effect entrenches discretionary trusts as the vehicle of choice for the fortunate wealthy to income split and thus legally minimise their tax bills.
Yes, if you are in the top tax bracket - 49.5 per cent if Labor gets its way - Bill Shorten has officially blessed you setting up a discretionary trust so that, on at least some of your income, the tax bill will be slashed to 30 per cent.

There's no secret about the tax purpose of such trusts, no expensive tax lawyers are required.
It's even spelt out at a simple level by : "From a tax perspective, the main advantage is that any income generated by the trust from business activities and investments, including capital gains, can be distributed to beneficiaries in lower tax brackets (often spouses or children)."

And so it remains.

This fiddling around the edges of the tax minimisation industry is actually worth about a billion dollars a year.
That's not bad, but it's also not a great deal in the broader scheme of things. It's less than a third of what the  through trust structures.
It's not much more than would be saved by the  before the last election.
To make the soft nature of the reform abundantly clear, Labor provided a fact sheet that included an example under current tax rates of John, a very well-paid lawyer using a discretionary trust to distribute $210,000 equally to a spouse and two adult children with no other income.
This fiddling around the edges of the tax minimisation industry is actually worth about a billion dollars a year.

"Under the current tax arrangements, this would give the family members a tax bill of $47,100 - a $51,600 saving compared to the income tax John would have paid at the top marginal tax rate," says the fact sheet.
Under Labor's proposal, each of the three $70,000 distributions would be taxed at 30 per cent, giving a total tax bill of $63,000. That's still successfully avoiding $35,700 in tax John would have to pay if not for the trust structure.
A Murdoch Sunday tabloid headlined this as "Labor's war on the rich".
If this is war, they're firing blanks.
