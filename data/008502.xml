  <title>Pollie's terror tweet apology 'not enough'</title>
  <content>
A Northern Territory Labor politician has been blasted for suggesting anti-terror raids carried out in Sydney to stop an alleged plane bombing were fabricated to boost the government's popularity in the polls.
Gunner government MLA Sandra Nelson was forced to apologise after making the comments on Twitter during the ABC's Q&A program.
"Polling for LNP not good. Therefore we now have a 'terrorist attack'. How convenient," she tweeted on Monday night.
Indigenous Affairs Minister Nigel Scullion said he was appalled Ms Nelson had accused the Coalition of a conspiracy, stating NT Labor was disgracefully treating national security as a joke for political gain.
The NT Senator said the member for Katherine's apology wasn't good enough, and demanded chief minister Michael Gunner censure her for disparaging the role of Australia's security agencies.
"Ms Nelson's comments have been highly offensive - not just to the Turnbull Government, but more importantly, to the hard-working men and women in our agencies who have disrupted 13 terrorist plots in Australia since 2014," Senator Scullion said on Wednesday.
On Tuesday Ms Nelson apologised for the "insensitive" and "flippant" remarks, denied she was downplaying terrorism, and clarified that she had been paraphrasing a panel member's "cynical viewpoint of government response to terrorism".
Ms Nelson later deleted the original post.
"All political parties of all stripes sometimes use national security as a political football, and we need to stop doing that," she said.
