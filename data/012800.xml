  <title>NSW counter-terrorism police charge two men over alleged jet plot</title>
  <content>
New South Wales counter-terrorism police have charged two men alleged to have been involved in a plot to bring down a passenger plane, arrested in raids last weekend across Sydney.
A 49-year-old man from Lakemba and a 32-year-old Punchbowl man have each been charged with two counts of preparing for, or planning, a terrorist attack.
Both men are due to face court in Parramatta on Friday morning.
Another man - arrested at Surry Hills - remains in police custody.
A 50-year-old man was released from police custody on Tuesday without charge.
The men were arrested on Saturday in raids across Sydney, with authorities alleging they were involved in a plot to bring down a passenger plane using an improvised device.
Police conducted searches across Sydney earlier this week, including in the suburbs of Lakemba, Punchbowl, Surry Hills, Wiley Park and Bankstown.
