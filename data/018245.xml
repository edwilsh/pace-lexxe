  <title>Man dies as car hits tree on Central Coast</title>
  <content>
A man is dead after his car veered off the road and hit a tree on a notorious stretch of road on the NSW Central Coast.
The man's car smashed into the tree off Wilfred Barrett Drive north of The Entrance on Saturday morning.
He was treated by paramedics but died at the scene.
It's not the first fatality on Wilfred Barrett Drive, at least one other roadside memorial is prominently displayed on a bend not far from the site of Saturday's crash.
A 54-year-old man also died in a crash on Friday night when his car collided with another on the Great Western Highway in Minchinbury.
