  <title>Science comes alive for 20,000 kids</title>
  <content>
FROM the mystery of space to the science of soap bubbles, some of life's biggest - and smallest - questions will be explored at Adelaide Showground this weekend.
Adelaide's largest science expo, Science Alive, will include 60 interactive exhibitions.
The event will feature a mobile planetarium, allowing visitors to learn about the science of stars, planets and gravity as well as how some of the world's cultures interpret the night sky.
Event organiser Brian Haddy says children will also enjoy a performance from Adelaide-based entertainer Marty McBubble who, in June, broke the Guinness World Record for the largest floating soap bubble (19.8 cubic metres) during an attempt at Lockleys Primary School.
"There will also be plenty on offer for teenagers and adults with (defence technology firms) Lockheed Marton and BAE Systems offering examples of cutting-edge technology," Mr Haddy says.
Organisers expect more than 20,000 people to attend the event, which is now in its 12th year as part of National Science Week celebrations.
Melanie Colyer, 8, is looking forward to the event.
"I like that science is a chance to learn new things every time," Melanie says.
Science Alive is from 9am-5pm on Saturday and Sunday at Adelaide Showground, Wayville.
Adult tickets are $15 and under-18s free at
