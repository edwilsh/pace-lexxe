A controversial yet critically acclaimed documentary highlighting sexism in the outback is screening for a limited time at the Gala Cinema in Warrawong.
Hotel Coolgardie (shot in 2012) is an observational documentary exploring what happens when two Finnish backpackers land in a small Western Australian mining town and begin working at the pub.
Director Pete Gleeson's film takes a warts-and-all look at Australia's regional culture and follows the women on their working holiday, treated both as "fresh meat" and outsiders by locals.

Hotel Coolgardie - Trailer
The holiday rapidly deteriorates into a bizarre test of endurance, as Lina and Steph discover to meet expectations they'll need to do more than just pour drinks.
As director Pete Gleeson tells Fairfax Media, "how the women adapted to the dominant culture determined everything, from whether they could have enjoyable tourist experiences, to whether they could get a lift into town to buy groceries, to even their meals".

They can play nice with the locals, or face the consequences of continued - and likely increasingly aggro - harassment.
