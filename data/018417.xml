  <title>'You are in danger' - SES warn</title>
  <content>
BRACE yourselves - a cold front is bringing gale force winds, thunderstorms, squally showers and possible minor floodin is on its way, authorities warn.
The cold front, which was located near Lower Eyre Peninsula and Kangaroo Island around 4pm on Saturday, is moving eastwards across the state and is expected to be near Adelaide and Mount Gambier by early evening, before continuing into the Murraylands district by late evening.
The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a warning for people in the Adelaide Metropolitan, Mount Lofty Ranges, Lower Eyre Peninsula, Yorke Peninsula, Mid North, Kangaroo Island, Murraylands, Upper South East, Lower South East and parts of the West Coast, Eastern Eyre Peninsula and Riverland districts.
The SES have advised all South Australians south of Port Pirie to stay indoors and away from windows, warning "you are in danger from flying debris, falling frees and downed powerlines".
"Roads may be dangerous, do not travel unless absolutely necessary."
Damaging winds averaging 55-65 km/h are possible over coastal parts and at elevated parts of the warning area, reaching up to 90-125 km/h.
Locally destructive gusts in excess of 125km/h are possible with showers and thunderstorms near the front, followed by a vigorous westerly airstream.
Locations which may be affected include Adelaide, Port Lincoln, Kingscote, Cleve, Maitland, Mount Gambier, Port Pirie, Clare, Murray Bridge, and Naracoorte.
Port Lincoln and Cape Borda have recorded damaging winds averaging 55-65 km/h with gusts of 85-90 km/h on Saturday afternoon.
Heavy rainfall in the Mount Lofty Ranges this evening may lead to flash flooding.
"Further rain is expected on these catchments from Saturday afternoon, continuing into Sunday, which may result in river and creek rises throughout the Mount Lofty Ranges."
"Localised minor flooding is possible from Saturday evening particularly from Oakbank to Verdun and may lead to some road closures."
State Emergency Service volunteers have spent Saturday filling sandbags in preparation for strong winds and possible flooding later today.
The SES has already received more than 27 phone calls and is gearing up for a busy night.
Sandbags will also be be available at 10am on Sunday across six SES units.
■ Enfield SES Unit - Hoods Rd, Northfield
■ Noarlunga SES Unit - Corner of Lindsay and Brian roads, Londsale
■ Metro South SES Unit - 33 Beagle St, Lynton
■ Campbelltown SES Unit - 141 Montacute Rd, Campbelltown
■ Mount Barker SES Unit - 14 Simper Cres, Mount Barker
■ Port Adelaide-Enfield council depot - Willochra St, Largs North
On Saturday, SES Mt Barker unit operations response manager Stuart Catt said they had 30 cars come through in the first two and a half hours.
"Today is actually rather busy," he said.
"We've gone through roughly four tonnes of sand already."
Mr Catt said the SES was encouraging people to prepare for 80mm of rain across the Mt Lofty Ranges as predicted by the Bureau of Meteorology.
"There could be localised thunderstorms with severe wind as well," he said.
"We're actually really glad that people are turning up and being prepared because it means the workload during the storm will be less for us."
Mr Catt said during the storm, people should stay indoors and away from trees.
"If it does get wet, call 132500 or if there is water in your house call triple-0," he said.
"We are on standby for tonight and tomorrow and possibly into Monday morning at this stage.
Mt Barker resident Terry was at the SES collecting sandbags and said she experienced flooding in her garage a few weeks ago as well as last winter.
"I thought I should do something about it," she said.
Stirling father Michael Newbury, 41, said his family were preparing for the heavy rainfall by using sandbags to prevent water run-off from the road going down their driveway.
"Last September we lost an entire cliff at our house and we spent seven months not living at home and having a team of bulldozers rebuild it," he said.
"We're just making sure it doesn't collapse again.
"We've got hoses on the lawn siphoning the water off to stop the water building up there and we've tried to clear away anything that could get blown away in the wind me do damage.
Mr Newbury had also cleared away trees and branches from around his house so "nothing could hit it".
The Bureau advises you should:
■ Move vehicles under cover and away from trees
■ Secure or put away loose items around your property
■ Stay indoors and keep away from widows when conditions are severe.
Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Tom Boeck said there will be a brief relief on Saturday morning but another front moving eastwards across the state will bring heavy showers and thunderstorms by midday Saturday.
"Winds will be strong and gusty, we will definitely be seeing an increase in the severity of winds," he said.
There is possible hail south of Keith to Port Lincoln in the early morning on Saturday and again in the evening.
On Sunday, a low pressure system developing south of Mt Gambier will bring another bout of rain, thunderstorm and small hail to south of the Barossa Valley. Adelaide temperature will only reach a maximum of 14C.
Over the weekend until Tuesday, Mt Lofty is expected to receive up to 70mm rainfall in total, with 40mm over the south coast district.
The wet weather will ease on Monday.
