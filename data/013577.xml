  <title>Donald Trump told Malcolm Turnbull the refugee deal was 'stupid' in leaked call transcript</title>
  <content>
A transcript of US President Donald Trump's controversial phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has been released by the Washington Post, revealing more details about their heated phone call.
Reports at the time of the February conversation, held shortly after the President's inauguration, claimed Mr Trump had said his conversation with Mr Turnbull was "the most unpleasant" of any he had with various world leaders.
While Mr Trump quickly denounced those reports as "fake news", these latest transcripts detail the frosty nature of the call.
In the call, Mr Trump complained about being saddled with an Obama administration agreement to help resettle some refugees who attempted to reach Australia by boat, particularly as Mr Trump was rolling out his travel ban.
"Boy, that will make us look awfully bad," Mr Trump said.
"Here I am calling for a ban where I am not letting anybody in and we take 2,000 people. Really it looks like 2,000 people that Australia does not want, and I do not blame you by the way, but the United States has become like a dumping ground."
Mr Turnbull countered that "this is a big deal, and I think we should respect deals".
Mr Trump returned: "This is going to kill me."
"I am the world's greatest person that does not want to let people into the country.
"And now I am agreeing to take 2,000 people, and I agree I can vet them, but that puts me in a bad position."

Mr Turnbull, in pressing for the refugee deal to be honoured, repeatedly appealed to Trump's background as a dealmaker.
Mr Turnbull: "There is nothing more important in business or politics than a deal is a deal."
Mr Trump: "You have brokered many a stupid deal in business, and I respect you, but I guarantee that you broke many a stupid deal. This is a stupid deal. This deal will make me look terrible ... I am going to get killed on this thing. I will be seen as a weak and ineffective leader in my first week by these people. This is a killer."
Mr Turnbull: "You can certainly say that it was not a deal that you would have done, but you are going to stick with it."
With an agreement over the refugee resettlement plan not forthcoming, Mr Trump was blunt in sizing up his exchange with Mr Turnbull.
Mr Trump: "This was my most unpleasant call, because I will be honest with you. I hate taking these people. I guarantee you, they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people.
"That is enough, Malcolm. I have had it. I have been making these calls all day, and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call."
Mr Turnbull tried a more diplomatic tack, telling the President: "Thank you for your commitment. It is very important to us."
He pledged to "be there again and again" for the US. The call ended with them thanking each other.
Despite the heated exchange, Mr Trump later tweeted:

In other leaked transcripts, Mr Trump told Mexico's President Pena Neito he did "not want to meet with you guys" if Mexico would not pay for the border wall.
Mr Trump also told Mr Neito he won New Hampshire in last year's election "because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den".
