  <title>SA vows to push ahead on bank tax</title>
  <content>
South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill has vowed to push ahead with the state government's controversial tax on the big banks ahead of a key debate in state parliament.
The budget measure is facing possible defeat in parliament's upper house with the Liberal opposition and some independents vowing it will not get their support.
The banks have also continued their campaign against the tax which they say will have a big impact on business investment in SA, but Mr Weatherill says the government hasn't given up on passing the legislation.
