  <title>Shari-Lea Hitchcock and her red-hot lips on the track</title>
  <content>
If Australia's most famous former mistress, Shari Lea Hitchcock, was looking for a distraction from the heady few months she's just endured, she can at least take heart that her horses are firing on the track.
The one-time lover of king of the boxes, the late Dick Pratt, makes a star appearance in our sister column, Bloodlines, on Friday (hey, we have expansive reading habits), celebrating the recent successes of the horses she trains and breeds, Duchess Royale and Stormborn Angel.
The what? we hear you say. The horses she trains. The mother of Pratt's youngest daughter, Paula, is a keen owner-trainer of the gee-gees, keeping them on her sprawling estate in the Southern Highlands and training them down at Kembla Grange. The Hitchcock racing silks? Pink-and-white stripes with (and we quote) "red-hot lips on the cap". Of course.
Bloodlines tells us Shari-Lea "always had a love of horses" and that "Duchess Royale was one of her first home-breds, with the filly sired by Dylan Thomas from her mare Pussycat Doll". We're not touching that one.

We dare say the fillies provide a welcome distraction from her current tribulations: she is due to face court in September for a hearing into assault charges after she allegedly bit a police officer following a long lunch at Sydney's Centennial Hotel last year.
