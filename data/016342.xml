  <title>Vic teenagers arrested over home invasions</title>
  <content>
Three teenagers have been charged over a string of home invasions in regional Victoria.
Two of the boys, aged 13 and 14, were charged on Friday with multiple counts of aggravated burglary and theft in connection with the break-ins in Mooroopna, near Shepparton, over the past month.
Both have been bailed to appear in court later this year.
A 15-year-old boy, who was on bail, remains behind bars for aggravated burglary, theft and attempted armed robbery.
