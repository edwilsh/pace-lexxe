  <content>
Residents in Port Pirie, north of Adelaide, have been advised to stay indoors and away from windows with wild storms thrashing the area.
The SES advised people on Saturday evening they were in danger from flying debris, falling trees and downed powerlines.
There was also a travel warning in place and an advisory to stay off roads unless absolutely necessary.
