A WHITE Rock man is due to appear in court later this month accused of assaulting his daughter and sending her an indecent picture on his phone.
It is alleged the 47-year-old assaulted the 14-year-old girl at his residence on July 16.
He later allegedly sent her the indecent picture via mobile phone.
The child allegedly sustained facial bruising and swelling as a result of the incident.
Officers from the Cairns Child Protection Investigation Unit spoke with the man yesterday morning.
He was subsequently charged with one count each of assault occasioning bodily harm and indecent treatment of a child under 16 years.
The man is scheduled to appear in the Cairns Magistrates Court on August 25.
