Shares in healthy fast food chain Oliver's Real Food have slumped after the recently-listed company warned it will not meet its earnings, profit and revenue forecasts for 2016/17.
Oliver's has announced to the ASX that it expects an earnings loss of $2.552 million for 2016/17, compared to $1.939 forecast in its prospectus, due to lower net sales, delayed store openings, inventory adjustments and unexpected one-off costs.
The company said its 2017/18 guidance remains unchanged but its shares were down 15.2 per cent to 28 cents at 1156 AEST.
