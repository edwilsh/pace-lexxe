Hunter police are investigating the assault of a woman in her own home in Singleton on Monday night.

About 9pm a 42-year-old woman answered a knock at the door of her Harriet Street home.
A woman, who was known to the resident, was at the door with a man.
A confrontation occurred between the two women resulting in the two visitors allegedly forcing their way into the home.
The man and woman punched and kicked the 42-year-old resident before leaving the premises.
The woman suffered a fractured eye socket, cheek bone and nose. She managed to walk to her neighbour's home where emergency services were called.
She was taken to John Hunter Hospital where she remains in a serious but stable condition.
Investigations into the assault will continue today by detectives from the Hunter Valley Local Area Command.
