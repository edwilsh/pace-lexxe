  <title>'Like Daley telling Walters how to win Origin': Palaszczuk backs Qld exports in trade row</title>
  <content>
The Queensland premier says exports from the state will continue to grow even with plans to prioritise local businesses bidding for government contracts.
Annastacia Palaszczuk announced local businesses were poised to receive weightings of up to 30 per cent in consideration of government contracts at last weekend's state Labor conference, drawing condemnation from federal Trade Minister Steve Ciobo.Photo: Tammy Law
He labelled the plan "reckless", said he was investigating the legality of the proposition and feared it would discriminate against international trade partners.
New Zealand's Trade Minister Todd McClay also weighed in,  and that the state may abandon the arrangement.

As the governments continue to trade blows over the proposed policy, Ms Palaszczuk said 80 per cent of all extra export dollars earned since 2015 have come from Queensland.
"Getting advice from Mr Ciobo about growing trade would be like Laurie Daley telling Kevvie Walters how to win State of Origin," she said on Saturday.

"We will continue to grow our export markets."

Ms Palaszczuk said Queensland's exports, worth $65.9 billion, were declining when she came to office.
"We have turned that around and it's helped generate 77,300 new jobs," she said.
Mr Ciobo, however, said the move was "stepping on toes globally."
"It's now time this policy was reversed and reversed quickly," he said.
