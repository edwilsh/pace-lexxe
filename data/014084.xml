The Inner City Bypass will include a full interchange at the John Hunter Hospital, the state government has confirmed. 
Health Minister Brad Hazzard on Friday announcedd the $13 million for a second access to the hospital would be added to the $280 million project, which runs between Rankin Park and Jesmond. 
Mr Hazzard thanked medical staff for "emphasising" the importance of the full interchange on his last visit. 
"The interchange will improve traffic flow across the western suburbs of Newcastle and connect key regional destinations, including Bennetts Green, Charlestown and Jesmond shopping centres," Mr Hazzard said. 
"It will also establish an alternative path of travel to the hospital in case of emergency or critical incident."
