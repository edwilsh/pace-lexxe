  <title>End political donations: Labor senator</title>
  <content>
A prominent Labor senator who allowed a state-linked Chinese company to pay part of his travel bill is now calling for a total ban on political donations.
Sam Dastyari candidly admits he was one of the "weapon suppliers in this arms race" during his time as secretary of Labor's NSW branch.
"It needs to come to an end, and the time for that is now," he told ABC-TV's Australian Story on Monday.
