  <title>Stanley joins Tassie cruise calendar</title>
  <content>
TASMANIA'S cruise ship boom is spreading the love to more regional ports, with Stanley to be added to the cruise ship calendar.
A planned visit to Stanley by boutique cruise ship MS Caledonian Sky - the first such visit by a cruise ship in living memory - has been hailed by the State Government as a major boost for North-West Coast tourism.
The 2016-17 cruise season was Tasmania's busiest ever, with 236,794 cruise ship visitors - a 45 per cent increase on the previous season.
There were 95 port calls around the State, including 17 in Burnie, 22 at Port Arthur, six in Wineglass Bay and one at Flinders Island.
The influx of ships will increase significantly again in 2017-18, with 138 port calls booked.
Liberal Braddon MP said a planned visit to Stanley by the MS Caledonian Sky was an exciting development.
"This will be a massive shot in the arm for the Circular Head region," Mrs Rylah said.
Destination Southern Tasmania CEO Melinda Anderson said the average spend onshore was also impressive - $172 in Hobart, $106 in Port Arthur, and $138 in Burnie.
"Importantly, for visitor dispersal, around 43 per cent of cruise passengers participated in an organised tour while they were in port," she said in a statement.
"And overall experience rated very highly at each port, with respondents rating their experience above 90 per cent positive."
