SHE'S currently one of the 19 women vying for Matty J's heart on The Bachelor, but love coach Belinda Rygier has already achieved one of her biggest goals - losing 22kg.
The 34-year-old has revealed on Instagram how it's taken her years to figure out what works best for her body.

"For years I hid my body out of fear of being called fat and ridiculed," she wrote on Instagram.
"It took me 16 years to work out why I couldn't lose weight. I tried everything you can think of."
She consulted a personal trainer and a naturopath and now sticks to a mostly gluten free, dairy free, sugar free diet.
"I finally found out my liver wasn't functioning properly and when I fixed it I lost 22kg," she said.
"I got the exact formula for me and I finally lost [weight]. It wasn't just about the diet and training.
"16 years of hard work, wrong advice and many different options to work out why I couldn't lose weight.
"I finally got the right advice, fixed my health and lost 20kg in only eight months.

"When I look in the mirror now I see the same person I always was, just different."
