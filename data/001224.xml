  <title>No jail time Tinder date slasher</title>
  <content>
A woman who slashed her Tinder date with a kitchen knife after she found out he was already in a relationship has avoided spending time behind bars.
Alana Rose Jones, 26, was sentenced in the Brisbane District Court on Monday to 18 months' jail with immediate parole after pleading guilty to one count of wounding.
The court heard Jones attacked the man with the knife after answering text messages from his girlfriend while he was passed out.
