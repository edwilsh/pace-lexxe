  <title>New peek inside RHH redevelopment</title>
  <content>
THE State Government has released a digital walk-through to give Tasmanians a sneak peek of what the completed Royal Hobart Hospital will look like.
Construction is due to begin soon on the new inpatient precinct to be known as K-Block on Campbell St.
The demolition of B-Block was completed in April with about 15,000 tonnes of rubble removed from the site to make way for K-Block.
Completion of the redevelopment is slated for the middle of 2019.
Last August, Mr Ferguson said the managing contractor,  if the project was not completed by the "practical completion date" of late December 2018.
Penalties were to rise to $35,000 a day after a further 30 days.
