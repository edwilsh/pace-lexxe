  <title>Punters put $82m into Peninsula pokies</title>

PENINSULA pokies punters spent a staggering $82 million playing electronic gaming machines in the last financial year.
New figures released by the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation show players fed $82,563,000 into machines from July 2016 to June 2017 - up around $200,000 on the year before.
There are 17 venues with pokies in the shire, containing over 850 licensed machines.
Not surprisingly January is the biggest spending month, with gamblers splurging more than $7 million in that month alone.
There are three venues with eight figure spends - the Grand Hotel in Mornington racked up $11 million, Rosebud Hotel recorded $11.2 million, and Steeples in Mornington garnered $10.2 million.
Alliance for Gambling Reform director Tim Costello said pokies were doing enormous damage to Victoria's most vulnerable communities.
He said while overall state gambling spending may have stabilised at $2.61 billion, it needed to substantially fall seeing as Australians lose the most per capita gambling of any people in the world.
"This time last year we surged through $50 billion in total Victorian losses and in this 25th year of dangerous pokies, another $2.61 billion of harm has been inflicted," Mr Costello said.
"If we keep this up for the next 25 years, these addictive devices will drain another $70 billion from victims."
Community Clubs Victoria chief operating officer Neill Murray said clubs relied on pokies revenue to help society through community programs, sports fields or new facilities.
Gaming Minister Marlene Kairouz said $150 million would be spent on tackling problem gambling during the next four years.
The shire's figures compare reasonably well with other municipalities.
Brimbank pokies players lost an incredible $134 million, Casey recorded $127 million and Dandenong registered a figure of $118 million.
