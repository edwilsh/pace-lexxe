  <title>Charges over Obeid-linked building fire</title>
  <content>
A man has been charged with deliberately lighting a fire at a southwest Sydney function centre linked to the Obeid family seven months ago.
Police say the Bellevue Reception Centre in Bankstown was deliberately set alight twice in December 2016 and January 2017, causing significant structural damage.
A 33-year-old man has been charged with dishonestly for gain, damage property by fire. He's due to appear at Parramatta Bail Court on Saturday.
