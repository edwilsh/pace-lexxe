  <title>Paul Tully leads poll for mayor, but others are closing in</title>
  <content>
ACTING Ipswich mayor Paul Tully is in the box seat to don the mayoral robes vacated by Paul Pisasale.

Sitting councillor Andrew Antoniolli is also a close bet in the race for the top job, according to a ReachTEL poll.

Both councillors are members of the Labor Party and regularly flanked former-ALP member Pisasale in public appearances during his reign as mayor.

The survey of 933 Ipswich voters was conducted by automated telephone calls on the night of August 3 on behalf of lobby group the Queensland Community Alliance.
