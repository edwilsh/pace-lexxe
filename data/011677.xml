Tasmania's Commissioner for Children and Young People Mark Morrissey will step down, announcing he'll leave the role in September.
Mr Morrissey took up the position in 2014 and says he has decided to move into part-time work.
"My lasting impression will always be of the many passionate and skilled people who work in government, community and private sectors who every day strive to make a positive difference to the lives of our children," he said in a statement on Thursday.
