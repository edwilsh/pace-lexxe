  <title>It seemed the fun never stopped</title>
  <content>
WHEN I was asked if I would write about the happenings when I arrived on the Sunshine Coast in 1978, I reflected on how lucky I have been.
If it hadn't been for Roy Thompson buying a hotel in Gympie and transferring the licence to the beachfront at Alexandra Headland in the early 1970s, I wouldn't be here.
Roy, an astute businessman, developer and philanthropist saw the huge potential of this sleepy fishing village and was one of the first to develop new infrastructure in the area. He built Chifley's Hotel which quickly became one of the top hotels in regional Queensland.
Roy could see so many business opportunities on the Sunshine Coast, he decided to sell Chifley's to the Stewart's Hotels Group and I was asked to manage its new pub.
For me, the stars had aligned. I had always loved the Sunshine Coast and to have the opportunity to bring my very pregnant wife Kay and our two boys, Will and James, to be raised on the Coast was too good to be true.
Changes were made. Chifley's became Stewart's Alexandra Hotel, Thommos Terrain became the Pioneer Grill Room with Max Mendells and his band playing every Friday and Saturday night, the Wind Jammer became The Galaxy, the private bar became Blazes, where Judith Durham from the Seekers and husband Ron Edgeworth regularly played jazz.
Our local parish priest, Father Harry Bliss, the person responsible for building Stella Maris Primary School, regularly wrote his weekly sermon while enjoying lunch in Blazes.
Allan and Chris Carroll entertained the younger clientele with disco and live bands in the Galaxy.
Endeavour luncheons with packed out audiences for guest speakers like The Right Honourable John Howard and Tony O'Reilly, a great sportsman and world-renowned businessman whose company controlled Australian Provincial Newspapers, took to the podium and addressed an adoring audience.
The Winter Wine Festival was a major attraction in the Galaxy every Thursday night in July. All the leading wine producers were there to give tastings of their latest vintages. A huge raffle was drawn with proceeds going to the Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Society.
Greg Chappell regularly came to support the charity, helping my wife Kay with the draw.
I well remember taking a delivery of wine to Coolum and seeing our much-loved shire chairman Eddie De Vere, shire clerk Don Christiansen and the entire Maroochy Shire Council inspecting a land parcel south of Coolum which later became the Hyatt Coolum.
Twin Waters was still a pipe dream and nobody could have envisaged the unprecedented growth that was still to happen at Pelican Waters.
Ian McDonald ran the Noosa Shire, Jack Beausang was the driving force for the Lansborough Shire but Eddie De Vere will forever be remembered for encouraging the major development that was happening between Mooloolaba and Maroochydore.
Nambour was our regional centre.
Everyone listened to Geoff Malcolm (The Legend) on 4NA, playing all the hits and keeping us up to date with local news.
Jim Bailey and Ray Grace sold the majority of cars on the Coast while Clem Renouf, a local Nambour accountant, became World President of Rotary International.
The Sunshine Coast was really on the move.
So many wonderful memories of this great place to raise a family. Kay and I had another three daughters born on the Sunshine Coast: Emily, Claire and Libby.
We are happily retired and living in Buderim Gardens Retirement Village and nothing gives us more enjoyment than having our children and grandchildren visit us.
