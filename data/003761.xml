  <title>Federal Braddon MP Justine Keay clears up citizenship doubts, hits back at doubters</title>
  <content>
Federal Labor MP Justine Keay, who was elected in the Tasmanian seat of Braddon last July, says she has resolved questions about her citizenship and is in the clear.
At the weekend,
Two Greens senators, Scott Ludlam and Larissa Waters, have had to resign after it was revealed they held dual citizenship, and questions have been raised about other MPs.
Liberal Senator Matt Canavan has removed himself from Cabinet for the same reason but is taking the matter to the High Court.
Ms Keay was a dual-British citizen but said she renounced her citizenship before going to the polls last year.
She has now reviewed her paperwork and is confident she had met the requirements, doing everything in her power to ensure she was eligible for election.
"The critical part is when you are looking at the landmark decisions of the High Court in these cases, it's about the process the candidates take before they nominate," she told
ABC Hobart.
"I always knew I had done the right thing.
"Constitutional law is all very confusing, but if people would take time and look at these cases it was very clear what the judge's determinations were.
"That is what I did, I provided proof of that to the Labor Party and they cleared me.
"I knew, before I signed that nomination paper that I had satisfied, over and beyond the requirements under section 44 of the Constitution."
In a social media post Ms Keay appeared to lash out at her critics when announcing she would be making a statement on her citizenship.
"Some will be disappointed, some relieved, and many won't give a toss," she posted on Twitter.
Tasmanian senator Nick McKim, who was narrowly elected in last year's poll, is also rechecking his citizenship and is expecting confirmation soon.
