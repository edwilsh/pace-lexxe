  <title>Mouse on the run 'grosses out' sushi customers</title>
  <content>
A hungry customer has captured the moment a small mouse was spotted scurrying around a takeaway sushi shop.
The mouse was seen at the Westfield Marion in the refrigerator of Dozo Japanese Food Express, in Adelaide.
A woman, who didn't want to be named,  she was "shocked and horrified" to spot the little rodent rummaging amid the food as she stopped for lunch last month.
"I'm actually really quite grossed out by it," she said.
"I thought I was in a dream. I actually thought I was dreaming.
"If there's one, there could be more. My thought was how did it get into there in the first place -- the glass cabinet has folding doors."
In a statement to 9NEWS, Westfield said health and safety is their "top priority" and they had since brought in pest control workers.
