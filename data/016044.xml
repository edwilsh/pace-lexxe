AS WORK begins on the long-awaited Chandler Highway Bridge upgrade, a new VicRoads video reveals the scope of the massive project.
The State Government will build a six-lane bridge next to the existing traffic-snarled two-lane bridge, which connects Alphington to Kew.
The old bridge, which is heritage-listed, will be preserved and converted to a walking and cycling trail.
VicRoads says the upgrade will remove one of the state's worst bottlenecks, which is used by more than 44,000 motorists each day.
New safety features will benefit pedestrians and cyclists while improved signalling will keep the traffic flowing.

The $110 million project will create more than 100 jobs, according to the State Government.
Roads Minister Luke Donnellan said the travel time savings could be up to 20 minutes for some users.
The bridge is expected to be completed by late 2018.
