  <title>Here's How Long Frozen Foods Can Last In Your Freezer [Infographic]</title>
  <content>
Putting food in the freezer is like a pause button on its shelf life. Meat that will go bad in a week can instead last months. However, even frozen food can go bad. This chart shows how long different types of food can last in the freezer.

The chart divides foods into several categories including meats, dairy, bread and seafood. Towards the bottom, you'll also find a list of items that you probably shouldn't freeze at all. Before you decide to preserve some of your food long-term, give this chart a glance to see how long you have before you'll have to throw it out.
