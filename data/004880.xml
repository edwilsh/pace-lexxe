LANCE Franklin was lucky to avoid suspension over an incident involving Luke Hodge on Friday night that Mark Robinson says has become symptomatic throughout his career.
Franklin was slapped with a $1500 fine for making contact with Hodge's face in an early scrap, but cleared of a second charge after he felled his former Hawk teammate.

DANGER BAN:
ROBBO:
Robbo joined the SuperFooty Podcast with Michael Warner, Lauren Wood and Anthony Hudson, dubbing Franklin's action to come through and hit Hodge with his upper arm "The Buddy Snipe".
He said Buddy disguises his hits as clumsy acts, but it happens to often to be a mere coincidence.
"He's been doing that for five, six years, he runs in and hits people with the inside of the upper arm," Robbo said.

"This guy can do anything, unbelievable, his timing ... he is just a beautiful footballer.
"And he runs in from 20m and gets Hodgey high in the shoulder, across the face with the inside of his arm, which he's done a hundred times.
"The MRP has been sucked in on this.
"He's very lucky, Buddy."

"Franklin was ... lucky in another incident when he employed one of his favourite manoeuvres - we'll call it the Buddy Sling - where he arrives to tackle, instead he slings an arm to make contact with the player."
