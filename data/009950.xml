  <title>Developers offer stamp duty discounts as off-the-plan apartment sales slow  </title>
  <content>
Slowing off-the-plan apartment sales to foreign buyers in Sydney have forced developers to mount a stamp duty discount strategy to attract more buyers.
Australia's biggest apartment developer , while  is offering foreign buyers a 4 per cent discount on stamp duty if they buy an apartment at its "Oasis" project in the inner west Sydney suburb of Ashfield by July 31.
Crown's discounts also extend to local first-home buyers.
Another active residential developer, JQZ, has put up Chinese advertisements on social media offering "stamp duty" discounts for its .

"With an increase in the foreign person surcharge purchaser duty coming into effect on July 1, and in order for Meriton to maintain our sales rate to fund future developments, we wanted to compensate buyers for a limited time," Meriton director of sales James Sialepis said.

Mr Sialepis also said it was not unusual for developers such as Meriton to offer such incentives occasionally and was not an indication that there was a "glut" of apartments or a potential major correction in prices.
"We have been surprised by the positive response to this offer, especially from local tenants living in a Meriton development who have struggled to save for their first purchase, given such high taxes."
'Healthy levels'

Managing director of CBRE Residential Projects David Milton said developers who rely heavily on foreign buyers or sell poorer quality stock tend to revert to these tactics.

While sales have slowed overall compared to the frenzied years of 2013 and 2014 -  and cut in bank lending to investors - they are still selling at "healthy levels", particularly those in good locations and are well developed.
"Meriton have been selling stock overseas and haven't focused on the local market .. .and for property developers like Meriton, in order to sell lower quality products, they have to offer discounts," he said.
There were, however, some mixed messages in the apartment market, the Agency's Steven Chen said. While sales were slow with foreign buyers, developer interest to build apartments has not waned.
But some developers have started to mitigate their apartment exposure with house and land development.

Mortgage broker and agent N1 Holdings' Ren Hor Wong was not as upbeat, both with new and secondary sales of apartments.
"The sentiment is definitely not as positive ... I've even heard agents or developers covering legal fees," he said.
"There is a lot of competition in the market, people have more choice.
"A better location always defies a slowdown but a lot of apartment sellers are now worried. Repayment hits them, but rental growth is subdued."
