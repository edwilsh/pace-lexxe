  <title>Melbourne Express: Tuesday, August 1, 2017</title>
  <content>
10 days into his career as White House communications director, Anthony Scaramucci was fired from the role by President Donald Trump on Monday.

Mr Scaramucci became instantly famous for giving an expletive-laden interview to the New Yorker, in which he called the President's former chief of staff Reince Priebus a "f------ paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac" (among other things).

Here's the NYTimes this morning:

Mr. Scaramucci's abrupt removal came just 10 days after the wealthy New York financier was brought on to the West Wing staff, a move that convulsed an already chaotic White House and led to the departures of Sean Spicer, the former press secretary, and Reince Priebus, the president's first chief of staff.

In a Twitter message just before 5:30 on Monday morning, just hours before the announcement about Mr. Scaramucci, Mr. Trump insisted that there has been "No WH chaos!"
A factory in Moorabbin was nearly consumed by a late-night conflagration, with the blaze threatening to spread to an adjoining building.

A smoke warning was issued for nearby homes after the factory in Nelson Street, Moorabbin, caught fire on Monday night, the Metropolitan Fire Brigade said.

The blaze was threatening to spread to another factory that shares a wall with the burning building. Fire crews took several hours to bring it under control even with the help of aerial attack units.

No injuries were reported.

There is a good service on all train lines, except the Frankston line where there are 15-minute delays in both directions.
Police are asking for your assistance to find two missing people, 35-year-old man Fahmy Bakesy and 21-year-old Cranbourne man Liam Magri.

Mr Bakesy was last seen on Bell Street, Heidelberg Heights outside of the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital. He was spotted boarding the 903 bus towards Mordialloc just after 3.30pm.

Mr Magri was last seen at a house on Dunferline Crescent, Cranbourne about 5pm on Sunday 9 July.

Making news this morning, reports around that a large number of police vehicles - perhaps as many as 30 - have been spotted in the northern suburbs.

The word from a police spokesman is they are hunting down a stolen car. That car has now been found, and police officers are on their way back to their stations.
Good morning Melbourne, welcome to Tuesday, the day before hump-day. Grab a coffee, we'll get through this together.
