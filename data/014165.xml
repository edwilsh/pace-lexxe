  <title>Australia's Matildas lead Brazil 4-1 in final Tournament of Nations clash</title>
  <content>
Australia's Matildas are on the verge of claiming the Tournament of Nations after racing to a 4-1 lead over Brazil at half-time in their final match in Carson, California.
Brazil had opened the scoring through Camila in only the second minute but it was all one-way traffic from that point, with the Matildas slotting four unanswered goals to set up the commanding lead at the break.
Lisa De Vanna was the first to score for the Matildas in the seventh minute and they later moved into the lead when Caitlin Foord finished off an outstanding full-field movement just after the half-hour mark.
De Vanna doubled her tally two minutes later, before Katrina-Lee Gorry added the fourth close to half-time.
