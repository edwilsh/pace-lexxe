  <title>Freelancer was never No. 1, but now it seems to be in huge trouble</title>
  <content>
While managing to escape without any mainstream press coverage, the collapse of Freelancer's share price has been a rapid fall from grace for former BRW Rich Lister Matt Barrie. Shares in Freelancer, Barrie's tightly held outsourcing marketplace, are in free fall, dropping more than 70% from a high of $1.80 in early 2016 to only 52 cents today. The former market darling's value has slumped to $238 million, a far cry from $800 million around 18 months ago.
