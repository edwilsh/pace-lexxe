  <title>'People expect her to act': Clover Moore, Premier at war on Martin Place tent city</title>
  <content>
NSW's top homelessness body has called for the state government and City of Sydney to stop "blame shifting" over the emergence of a growing tent city in Martin Place, and instead act to develop more accommodation for inner-Sydney's homeless population.

The tent city spread out across Martin Place after an earlier encampment, food kitchen and clothing exchange adjacent to a construction site were disbanded by Sydney Council officials .
Community Services Minister Pru Goward said it was incumbent on lord mayor Clover Moore to shut the encampment, noting the city regularly policed the setting up of structures without permits:Photo: Daniel Munoz
"People expect her to act," she said.
But Cr Moore said the council had no power to forcibly move on the 50-plus people a night who sleep there, though its officers had been keeping the site clean.  

"Only the police can do that," the lord mayor said. "But even if the police were directed to do that, where does the minister expect people to go?

"What we're seeing in Martin Place is the direct consequence of decades of gutless inaction".  Photo: Daniel Munoz
The lord mayor proposed the state government reopen the Sirius public housing for those on the street and develop more-affordable housing options.
Some residents have told Fairfax Media they had been offered only up to five days' temporary accommodation, after which they would be forced to return to the streets to sleep.
But the state government said its outreach workers had made dozens of visits to the site and about 60 people had been found permanent accommodation but others had refused assistance.
"I'm concerned that some people there are not there for the right reasons," Ms Berejiklian said, adding that the sight of the tents made her "uncomfortable".
But Homelessness NSW, the state's peak advocacy group for homeless people, called for the council and state government to stop "blame shifting" and create a joint plan to for greater investment in "Housing First" programs that offer accommodation to homeless people with few conditions.
Homelessness NSW is campaigning for 30 per cent of housing in new developments to be.
A record 486 people "sleep rough" in .
One of the original Martin Place camp's leading organisers, Lanz Priestley, is a prominent figure in the anti-capitalist "Occupy" movement that swept the world in 2011. He has been accused by Liberal councillor Christine Forster of using homelessness to advance an "anarchist" agenda.
In 2013, Cr Moore supported a motion to request the police to dismantle the "Occupy Sydney" movement on the corner of Elizabeth Street and Martin Place, and which had been used as safe shelter by Sydney's homeless, by agreeing it impeded public use of Martin Place.   
About 60,000 people are on the waiting list for public housing in NSW.
The state government announced at the last election a $1 billion joint-venture affordable and social housing initiative.
