  <title>Knee fears for Demon defender after VFL injury</title>

Joel Smith was carried from the field with a knee injury during the Casey Demons' VFL win

MELBOURNE defender Joel Smith was stretchered off the field with a knee injury in the first quarter of Casey Demons' clash with Sandringham at Trevor Barker Oval on Saturday afternoon.

He reportedly landed awkwardly after flying for a mark early in the Demons' stirring win over Sandringham at Trevor Barker Beach Oval.

The athletic backman played three games in the senior team this season after being picked up in the 2015 rookie draft.

Smith's blow is the latest setback in a season that has been riddled by injury. 

He suffered a serious shoulder injury in the first quarter of his AFL debut in round one against St Kilda and missed the next three months after undergoing surgery.

The 21-year-old played two games in the VFL before earning a recall to the senior team in round 16, playing against Carlton and Adelaide before being left out of the team that went on to defeat Port Adelaide.
