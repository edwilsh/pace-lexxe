WATCHING someone else hoist his award in victory will be a singular pleasure for Josh Bruce this November.
The Mayfield freelancer, 36, has won a design competition for the Newcastle 500 trophy, officially locking him in as the designer for the annual trophy for the next five years. The designer's elegant curve came out on top of a group of designers aged between 12 and 72.
Its simplicity hides several nods to Newcastle's history and geography. 
Made from blue glass in tribute to the harbour, that section is backed with a steel rail spine to incorporate the city's industrial heritage. 
Its gentle bend mimics the curve of Nobbys headland. 
Mr Bruce, who works mostly in video production, said it was "fantastic" to win the title. 
"It basically just kind of designed itself," he said. 
The entrants spanned a wide age range, with the top three selections including 14-year-old Magdalane Prebble and Jan Lay, 72.
All judges chose Mr Bruce's design somewhere in their top three. 
Supercars chief executive James Warburton said the passion and enthusiasm from Novocastrians was clear in the calibre of entries. 
"Josh's integration of the harbour and the coastline with industry, shipping, surfing and the kerbing of the race track itself was spectacular, he said. "We will ensure we do Josh and all of Newcastle proud this November."
Judge and six-time Supercars Champion Jamie Whincup said it was difficult to sift through the entries. 

"It will be a real honour for one of us, hopefully me, to raise his trophy at the end of the year."
