  <title>Rhino stops traffic while charging down highway in northern India</title>
  <content>
Video has captured an unusual road incident in northern India where a rhinoceros was seen charging into traffic.
In a video posted by tour group 'North East of India' last Wednesday, the animal sprints down a highway in Assam, forcing oncoming cars to stop and reverse.
Vehicles travelling in the opposite direction can be seen offering the rhino a rather large berth.
Eventually, the fierce animal was blocked by a large van and ran off into nearby bushland, away from traffic.
