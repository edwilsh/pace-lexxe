  <title>ICAC finds three former NSW ministers corrupt</title>
  <content>
Former NSW Labor ministers Eddie Obeid, Joe Tripodi and Tony Kelly have been hit with fresh corruption findings and may face criminal charges after the state's corruption watchdog found they were involved in preparing a "deceptive" cabinet minute to benefit the Obeid family.

The watchdog found Mr Tripodi was "doing Mr Obeid's bidding" in backing attempts by AWH to enter into a lucrative public-private partnership with the state government in 2010.

The ICAC found the Obeid family had a $3 million stake in AWH, despite their claims the money was advanced as a loan.
It said representations made in legal documents that the money was a loan were "false and were known to be false" by Mr Obeid's son Eddie junior and AWH's former chief executive and chairman, Nick Di Girolamo.

A string of witnesses who appeared before the ICAC, including Mr Di Girolamo, have escaped adverse findings.
