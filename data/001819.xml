  <title>NSW man sentenced over cruelty to camel</title>
  <content>
The owner of a NSW petting zoo who allowed a camel to become "horribly emaciated" and a cow to lay dying on his property has been found guilty of animal cruelty.
Court documents show Joshua Luke Fraser, 29, was last week given a two-year good behaviour bond after he was convicted of failing to provide proper and sufficient drink, food and veterinary treatment to animals in his care.
Fraser was also banned from owning an animal for five years in Kurri Kurri Local Court west of Newcastle.
The RSPCA on Monday said inspectors acting on a complaint found the cow, which had to be put down after it suffered birthing paralysis and was unable to stand, on a Sawyers Gully property in 2015.
A year later, inspectors found a severely starved camel.
A vet later declared it had not received proper food for six months.
The camel subsequently died of a suspected lethal snake bite while under veterinary treatment.
