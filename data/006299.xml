  <title>Zombies, punks in festival line-up</title>
  <content>
THE world premiere of South Australian-made zombie film Cargo, a heart-wrenching story about a father in a race against time to save his child, will be one of the big drawcards at this year's Adelaide Film Festival.
Starring British actor Martin Freeman - Bilbo in The Hobbit - with the legendary David Gulpilil and Adelaide actor Natasha Wanganeen, the drama, which was filmed in the SA outback last year, is about an infected man trying to find refuge for his daughter before he succumbs.
The October festival will also feature the Australian premiere of one of the four Nicole Kidman films shown at the Cannes Film Festival, How to Talk to Girls at Parties, starring Kidman as a jaded punk. It is unlikely the Hollywood star will come to Adelaide.
Also showing will be the Australian premiere of indigenous director Warwick Thornton's period western, Sweet Country, starring indigenous actors alongside Sam Neill and Bryan Brown, which will show in competition at the Venice Film Festival.
A comedy drama about a family who reunite over the sale of the family home, F*!#ing Adelaide, created by Sophie Hyde and starring Adelaide actor Tilda Cobham-Hervey, will also have its world premiere, as will a documentary about indigenous child removal in the past decade, After the Apology, from activist Larissa Behrendt.
There will also be a world premiere of the documentary Dolphin Man, the life story of free diver Jacques Mayol.
Arts Minister Jack Snelling said the films were bold and compelling and the festival - previously biennial but guaranteed this year and next in tandem with the science and techno festival Hybrid World Adelaide - was an important world platform.
Artistic director Amanda Duthie said the highlights were a tease for the full program, including the much anticipated opening night film.

There's a reason Sofia Coppola won Best Director for this film at Cannes. Wenlei Ma thinks this remake of the 1971 Clint Eastwood classic is stunningly gorgeous. Starring Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst and Elle Fanning.
