Friday afternoon provided a rude awakening for an Esperance homeowner, who found a man asleep in her bed after he had indulged in her private champagne collection. 
A 36-year-old man allegedly forced entry into a home on The Esplanade and helped himself to a bottle of Louis Perdrier Champagne, between 11:30am and 1:00pm.

When the owner returned and located the man in her bed, she crept outside and called the police. 
Shortly afterwards, Esperance Police attended and arrested the man. 
The man was charged with burglary and stealing and will appear in Esperance Magistrates Court on August 8.
