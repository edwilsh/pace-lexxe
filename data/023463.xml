  <title>Wet weather closes roads across ACT as motorists urged to take caution</title>
  <content>
Weather conditions have closed several roads to motorists throughout the ACT as authorities urged caution.
Corin Road was closed to motorists near Gibraltar Pines at Square Rock car park on Monday. While those using four-wheel-drive vehicles could reach Corin Forest, from 5pm all traffic was barred from the road pending a reassessment at 6am on Tuesday. 
Weather also closed Mount Franklin Road at Bendora Arboretum. Access was barred to the unsealed section of Boboyan Road, except for 4WD vehicles.
The ACT Government urged motorists and other road users to take care across the territory, particularly on rural roads, unsealed roads and stream crossings, as snowy and icy weather continued.
