  <title>Jetstar brings back Hobart-Adelaide flights</title>
  <content>
DIRECT flights from Hobart to Adelaide will become available for the first time in seven years from mid-November.
Jetstar this afternoon announced it will offer direct flights to the city of churches on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays from November 14, with sale flights of $59 each way kicking off on Wednesday.
An estimated 55,000 people are expected to travel on the flights each year.
Jetstar Group chief commercial officer Catriona Larritt said increasing demand was the driver of the new route.
The last airline to offer direct flights between Adelaide and Hobart was Tiger Airways, but the service ended in 2010 because of diminished demand.
Currently, passengers wanting to travel to Adelaide from Hobart have to fly via Melbourne or Sydney, with a travel time of between four and six hours.
The direct Jetstar flights will be one hour and 50 minutes.
Premier Will Hodgman said the extra service and tourism growth would help build the case for a returned Australian Federal Police presence at the Hobart Airport.
