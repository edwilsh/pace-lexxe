  <title>Royals on verge of historic unbeaten premiership after toppling Vikings</title>
  <content>
The Canberra Royals' hopes of completing a perfect John I Dent Cup season are still alive despite a major semi-final scare against the Tuggeranong Vikings on Saturday.

Royals managed to hold on to beat the Vikings 32-26 at Viking Park, but had to battle on with 14 men for 20 minutes of the second half as Tuggeranong went for the kill.
Royals looked certain to charge into their second grand final in three years when they led 32-7 just after half-time.

But it all started to unravel when Royals had two players sent to the sin bin and Tuggeranong found their groove to score 19 answered points.
Jordan Jackson-Hope scored with 40 seconds left to cut the margin to six points and then led a length-of-the-field raid after the siren before Royals escaped with victory.

"We fell away at the end but we were down to 14 men, we dug deep and played tough. That's all you can ask," Johnston said.
"We haven't spoken about going through undefeated ... I don't think there are many teams in my team who have gone through a season undefeated.

"But we haven't hung on to the past. We can refocus now and hopefully come grand final day, we can put in another good performance."
Wests and the Queanbeyan Whites will play in a minor semi-final on Sunday, with the winner advancing to a preliminary final clash against Tuggeranong.
The Vikings have won five of the past seven premierships, but are now in danger of being bundled out of the play-offs if they fail to regroup next week.
"You've got to bounce out of that loss pretty quickly and already start looking forward to next week," said Vikings coach Tim Sampson.
"We had second-half fight. I thought we attacked really well in the second half, but we were disappointed in our first-up tackles in the first half."
Tuggeranong set itself for a massive upset when hulking flanker Sua Tonga crashed over in the opening minutes to stun the minor premiers Royals.
But it sparked a damaging reaction for Royals and they opened up a 20-point lead at half-time and extended it not long after the break.
Royals fullback Andrew Muirhead showed why the ACT Brumbies have signed him to a Super Rugby contract, bumping off two defenders and then beating another two with speed to score.
But the dominance diminished when Luke Kimber was sin-binned for repeated team infringements and just as he was about to return to the field, Mike Fakava was punished with another yellow card for the same offence.
It stifled Royals' attack and Tuggeranong found some rhythm, with Fred Dorrough, Andrew Robinson and Jackson-Hope all scoring to close the gap.
In the end the Royals were good enough to hold on, and Johnston said the Phillip-based side is desperate for another title after an upset win in 2015.
"You have no idea how much we want it," Johnston said.
"It's fantastic to win one. But to come from where we did two years ago and losing the players we did ... we've got a young side and hopefully we can get it done again."
