  <title>Vic axe man denies shooting friend's lover</title>
  <content>
A Melbourne septuagenarian has denied allegations he armed himself with a sawn-off rifle and a tomahawk before shooting his flatmate's lover.
Manfred Ulrich Kobert, now 77, is facing a jury trial charged with intentionally shooting Matthew Lovitt, 38, piercing his liver and right kidney, in May 2016.
The County Court of Victoria was told on Thursday that although Kobert agreed he entered the property with a "small axe", he didn't agree the gun was his, nor that he brought it into his home, or that he aimed it at Mr Lovitt.
