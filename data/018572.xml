Kris Lees was eyeing Melbourne spring group 1 glory with Invincible Gem after she beat stablemate Le Romain to help give her Newcastle trainer a flying start to the season.

Invincible Gem, a $9.50 chance on Friday, delivered for punters who crunched her into $6.50 for the group 2 Missile Stakes (1200 metres) at Randwick on Saturday.
Following Wahng Wah's win for Lees in race two (1800m), Invincible Gem and jockey Corey Brown settled sixth on the fence before trailing $1.95 favourite Le Romain (Glyn Schofield) into the race and powering past him at the 100m mark en route to a 1.3-length victory. Scone trainer Brett Cavanough's The Monstar was a narrow third to secure a Hunter-trained trifecta.
Lees was thrilled with his mare, which won four of seven starts last preparation, including victory in the Newcastle Spring Stakes, before a close second in the group 1 Randwick Guineas.
He was looking to the $400,000 group 2 Golden Pendant (1400m) at Rosehill on September 23 before the impressive first-up win, which put the group 1 Myer Classic at Flemington firmly in the frame.
"She's come back in super order," Lees told Sky Thoroughbred Central.

"She's been doing a lot of work with [Le Romain] and he's probably worked a little better than her at home, but she's a high-quality mare now.
"It's good to see with these three-year-old fillies, because you never know how they are going to come back in that early spring, and she's come back in terrific order.
"Last preparation she just kept surprising me. I was looking to spell her and she'd do so well after a win. I just kept raising the bar and she handled every step.
"It's another advertisement for that stallion [I Am Invincible], he just improves mares incredibly well.
"I was going to go for the Sheraco [Stakes] but she might get weighted out of that now, but it's set weights and penalties, so I'll work it out.
"Her main aim is the Golden Pendant and hopefully we get to Melbourne for the Myer (Classic)."
Three-time group 1 winner Le Romain, also first-up, was trapped wide in the run and battled on strongly for second.

His next target is the group 1 Memsie Stakes (1400) at Caulfield on September 2.
"He was exposed the whole way which was always a chance of happening," Lees said.
"He probably just ran out, the last 50 metres, of condition, and he's in for a good preparation."

The performances, and seconds for Launch Code and Admiral Jello, point to another big season ahead for Lees, who is coming off his personal best campaign of 161 winners nationwide, four group 1 victories and more than $9 million in prizemoney.
