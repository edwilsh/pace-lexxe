Jeremy Cameron will miss three matches with a hamstring injury

GREATER Western Sydney has suffered a massive blow in its push for a top-four finish with star forward Jeremy Cameron sidelined with a hamstring injury.

Cameron is expected to miss the next three matches - against Melbourne, Western Bulldogs and West Coast - but could return to the final-round blockbuster against Geelong.

Cameron has missed two of the past three matches with hamstring tightness, but returned for last week's win over Fremantle.
