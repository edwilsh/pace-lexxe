  <title>Misleading fuel price signs to be banned</title>
  <content>
Misleading discount fuel promotions will be banned at Queensland service stations.
From January 31, "confusing" deals which are not available to all drivers cannot be displayed, treasurer Curtis Pitt announced on Saturday.
"These strict regulations mean fuel retailers will still be able to promote discount fuel price schemes, but only the full price available to all motorists can be displayed on the price boards," Mr Pitt said.
