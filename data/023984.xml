  <title>Sydney tent city may be over as Lord Mayor signs deal with homeless</title>
  <content>
The row over a tent city set up by homeless people in Sydney's Martin Place seems to be over, with a deal struck between the Lord Mayor and those living in the camp.
Clover Moore has signed an agreement with the homeless in the area which says that they will move on when a 24-hour safe space is provided.
Ms Moore said she would put a proposal forward at the City of Sydney Council meeting tonight that $100,000 go towards establishing that permanent safe space.
She hoped the State Government would inject another $100,000.

The permanent safe space will be established as soon as possible, Ms Moore said, with a location yet to be confirmed.
In the meantime a temporary safe space will be set up.
Ms Moore said the safe space would not be for sleeping and beds would not be provided.
The camp, which is opposite the Reserve Bank building, will not be dismantled until a space is found, she said.
"What the homeless people really wanted was to know there would be a safe place where they could meet and get support," Ms Moore said.
"This is the best possible outcome."
Ms Moore said the tent city would be packed up as early as tomorrow morning when council trucks arrived to help pack up the site.

The people who have been living in the camp have all been offered accommodation by the NSW Family of Community Services which they have agreed to take up, Ms Moore said.
The agreement was negotiated with Lanz Priestley who set up the 24-7 Street Kitchen and Safe Space in Martin Place.
On Monday afternoon he expressed concerns about the fact the 24-hour drop-in centre would not provide a place to sleep, but around 9:00pm he signed the deal.
He said as long as people are put into accommodation, there would be no need to rebuild the camp.
"We are there on the basis of need," he said.
Shifting the blame

In the last week t.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told Parliament her government tried to intervene but had been turned away.
The Premier said it was up to the local government to forcibly remove the camp.
"I call on [Sydney Lord Mayor] Clover Moore to get rid of that tent city. It should not be there," the Premier said last week.
"Anyone who wants to receive help in New South Wales will receive that and I call on her to act because that is the right thing to do."
But Ms Moore said she did not have the power to move people on and urged the State Government to "do their job".
The Lord Mayor said she .
"That isn't politicking, it is doing my job to support society's most vulnerable, as my community expects," she said.
Ms Moore said the State Government had not provided enough affordable housing and the problem could be solved if vacant homes in the Sirius building were opened up for the campers.
Social Housing Minister Pru Goward said the Government had already provided permanent housing to those assessed as eligible.
