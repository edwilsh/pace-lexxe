  <title>Harvest from the heart</title>
  <content>
FINDON Primary School students have helped donate almost three students worth of fruit and vegetables to needy causes since the opening of their community garden.
Through food harvested from the garden for the Fare Grow Project, the students have handed over approximately 60kg of food, about three times the weight of an average six-year-old.
The garden was helped along the way thanks to a Leader Local Grant and Community Development Grant from Whittlesea Council.
Eight new fruit trees were planted in the garden at a ceremony last week that will soon produce apples, pears peaches and cherries.
The food was donated to Foodbank, who helps out Australians struggling with hunger.
"It's about showing the kids they can have self-sufficiency by always having something to harvest and eat," Kitchen Garden specialist Kath Jones said.
"We can show kids about making good use of the space, beautifying the area and inspiring the neighbourhood to do the same."
