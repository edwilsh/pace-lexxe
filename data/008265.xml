  <title>Dangling sign a High St hazard</title>
  <content>
THIS sign has seen better days.
The Leader snapped these pictures of a dangling sign outside an abandoned shop front in High St, Preston today.
Pedestrians should steer clear of the sign, which hangs on a busy stretch of High St on the corner of Bell St, near a bus stop and several cafes.
Darebin Council has been tipped off to the potential hazard.
