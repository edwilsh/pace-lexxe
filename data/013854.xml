  <title>North Korea the focus of weapons talks</title>
  <content>
The North Korea nuclear threat has been a focus of talks in Canberra between the US and Australian officials on weapons of mass destruction.
The talks had a special focus on both countries' efforts to promote the effective third country implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions on North Korea.
A US Department of State spokesperson said the sixth counter-proliferation dialogue had also considered trade controls and an upcoming military exercise in September to be held in Cairns.
