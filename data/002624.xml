  <title>Explosion rocks Iraqi embassy in Kabul</title>
  <content>
A car bomb has struck outside the Iraqi embassy in central Kabul, police say.
"I heard a blast and at the moment continued gunfire is ongoing near the embassy of Iraq in Shar-e Naw," a police source, who wanted to remain anonymous, told DPA.
There were no immediate reports of casualties.
No one has taken responsibility for the attack, though both the Taliban and an Islamic State affiliate have previously carried out such attacks in Kabul.
