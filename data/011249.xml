  <title>Amazon picks Dandenong South for first Aussie warehouse</title>
  <content>
AMAZON has confirmed it will open its first warehouse in Melbourne in a move it says will create "hundreds" of local jobs.
The US online giant this morning said it was opening its first warehouse, covering 24,000 square metres, in an industrial park in Dandenong South.
"We are thrilled to be creating hundreds of new roles in Dandenong South," Amazon Australia operations director Robert Bruce said.
"This is just the start. Over time we will bring thousands of new jobs to Australia and millions of dollars of investment as well as opening up the opportunity for thousands of Australian businesses to sell at home and abroad through Amazon Marketplace."
Mr Bruce said Dandenong South provided easy access to the South Gippsland Hwy, Monash Fwy and EastLink and the warehouse was close to a wide range of amenities for employees.
Amazon had been expected to announce Dandenong as the location for its first warehouse - the online retailer calls them "fulfilment centres" - after it began advertising for warehouse mangers to work in the area.
