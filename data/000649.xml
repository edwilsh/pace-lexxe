  <title>Victory coup as Milligan signs on as marquee</title>
  <content>
MELBOURNE Victory has scored a huge coup, luring back 2014-15 championship winning captain Mark Milligan as a marquee player.
Just days after their stunning capture of James Troisi on a deal under the salary cap, the recruitment of Socceroos vice-captain Milligan two years after his departure is a huge boost to Victory's chances of going one step further than last season's grand final loss to Sydney FC.
It also heralds yet another plank in coach Kevin Muscat's back to the future squad build, with Kosta Barbarouses another player who has been recruited for a second stint at the club after spending time away.
He has signed a one-year deal.
Milligan, who has played the last two years at UAE Pro League club Baniyas, had harboured hopes of trying his luck in England, only for visa issues to scupper the move.
Bolton Wanderers had been eyeing the 31-year old, but could not sign him because of trouble attaining a work permit.
Victory unveiled the defensive midfielder at a press conference on Monday morning.
Coach Kevin Muscat said "to say I'm pleased is an understatement".
