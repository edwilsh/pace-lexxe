  <title>Romsey children take exciting sensory path</title>
  <content>
ROMSEY Playgroup children are enjoying a new type of fun, with the completion of a sensory play area.
With support of Macedon Ranges Council and Lancefield and Romsey Bendigo Bank as well as Romsey business Contech Concrete Services, the playgroup has a sensory path unique to the shire.
Parent Lisa Wilson said upgrades included a larger sand pit with a rubber matting surface, a new vegetable garden and new sensory path.
"The sensory path holds many benefits for all children, providing many different textures, colours, shapes and objects to be explored," she said.
"Sensory and explorative play is wonderful for any child's development from an early age, and we are very excited to be able to provide this to our community.
"We are currently working on a sensory wall inside the playgroup room to provide tactile and explorative play for all children."
The playgroup runs 9.30-11.30am, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  for more details.
