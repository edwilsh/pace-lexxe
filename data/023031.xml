Australian Defence Force and US authorities are continuing the grim search for three Marines presumed dead after an aircraft crashed off the central Queensland coast.
The tilt-rotor MV-22 Osprey plunged into the sea at Shoalwater Bay, near Rockhampton, during a scheduled military exercise on Saturday.
It took off from the USS Bonhomme Richard in the afternoon before it reportedly smashed into the deck of the transport ship USS Green Bay.
There were 26 people aboard the aircraft, but only 23 were rescued.
Osprey crew chief Corporal Nathan Ordway and Lieutenant Benjamin Robert Cross have been identified as two of the three Marines presumed dead.
Corp Ordway's sister Taylor asked people to pray for her brother and the two other crew members in a post on the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit's Facebook page.
Ryan Cross confirmed his younger brother was one of the people unaccounted for during an interview with CBS Radio in the US.
Mr Cross said his brother always knew he wanted to be a pilot in the military.
"It had been his dream," he told CBS on Sunday.

Mr Cross said his brother was devoted to his family and the Marine Corps, but would also do anything for anybody who needed help
"He's the type of friend everybody wishes they had and the type of person everybody wishes they knew," he said.
Australia has pledged to provide the US with anything needed attempts to locate the bodies and aircraft continue.
US Charge d'Affaires James Carouso said he was grateful for the "sympathy and support" from Australia.
"Our thoughts and prayers are with the crew and families affected by the MV-22 incident," he tweeted on Sunday.
Australian Defence Minister Marise Payne said recovery efforts would be difficult.
"These recovery operations are complex in nature and are affected by a range of factors including weather conditions, water depth, debris and water current," she said.
An Australian navy ship and divers have been deployed to aid the recovery mission, which could take months.
Brigadier Chris Field, who commands the Australian Army's Townsville-based 3rd Brigade, said helicopters would also be used.
"We hosted Marines out of Darwin for about three months. They became part of the family," he told ABC radio on Monday.
"In any family circumstances we feel the sadness. We feel the sorrow."
The latest incident is the 10th known crash involving an Osprey - an aircraft that takes off and lands like a helicopter but flies like an aeroplane - since 1991.
The Japan Times reported on Monday the country's defense minister had asked the US to stop flying the MV-22 in its air space, because of concerns over safety.
