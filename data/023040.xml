  <title>Fire faces another tough task after 15 straight defeats</title>
  <content>
FOOTBALL: The Sunshine Coast will attempt to snap a 15-match losing sequence when it collides with Moreton Bay at Albany Creek on Tuesday night.
It's an unlikely scenario for the Fire, which is last on the 12-team state league ladder after 19 of 22 rounds.
The Bokarina-based unit claimed draws in its opening two games of the campaign but has failed to salvage a result since.
Meanwhile, Moreton Bay is sixth and in some form, having topped Redlands and Brisbane City in its past two outings.
The Jets unit includes Sunshine Coast product and talented young goal keeper Jordan Thurtell, who joined the club mid-season after being released by A-League club Perth Glory.
The game kicks off at 8pm.
Things don't get much easier for the Fire in its final two matches of the season, against Far North Queensland (seventh) and Brisbane City (fifth).
