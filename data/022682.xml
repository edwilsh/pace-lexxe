  <title>Tuggeranong council calls for buses to be diverted from Anketell Street cafe hub</title>
  <content>
The Tuggeranong Community Council is on a mission to re-route buses away from the town centre's main street.
Council chair Glenys Patulny said Anketell Street was a popular cafe precinct made unpleasant by constant passing buses.
While buses travel along Anketell Street en route to the interchange, there are no stops on the busy street.
"We want the buses to instead go through Cowlishaw Street and past Tuggeranong College," Ms Patulny said.
"We've discussed the prospect of re-routing the buses with Tuggeranong College and they are supportive.
"In 15 minutes sitting at a cafe on Anketell Street, we've had a bus come by just about every minute."

Town centre revitalisation

The ACT Government has committed more than $500,000 to a project designed to revitalise Tuggeranong's town centre.
Ms Patulny said re-routing the buses was a necessary first step.
The Tuggeranong Community Council first raised its request with the Government in March.
"We know that there is a lot of development happening, but one of the things we want done first is very simple," Ms Patulny said.
"We've got a lot of cafes out the front of the Hyperdome.
"And if we're trying to reinvigorate this whole area, then that would be a fantastic first step and would make a big difference to the atmosphere of the place."
Ms Patulny said the council would circulate a petition among Tuggeranong residents.
"I'd ultimately like to see this road be one-way," she said.
The council is awaiting a formal response from the ACT Government.
The Transport Minister has been contacted for comment.
