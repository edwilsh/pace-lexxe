Kakadu National Park ... a bird watcher's delight at any time.
Kakadu National Park will host one of Australia's largest gatherings of bird watchers and nature lovers during its annual Bird Week from October 1-7.
Whether it is graceful sea eagles 'fishing' on Yellow Water Billabong, or the remarkable 'Jesus Bird' seemingly walking on water, or local favourites such as the Jabiru and the tiny, but vividly beautiful, Kingfisher birds, Kakadu is one of the country's most spectacular location for lovers of exotic birds.
One of the best places to view Kakadu's immensely rich and diverse bird life is on Yellow Water Billabong, at Cooinda. Yellow Water Cruises and Kakadu Tourism will be offering visitors exceptional opportunities to get close to Kakadu's rich bird life during the special week.
Cooinda Lodge and the Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel are both offering 15 per cent discounts off normal rates during the week.
