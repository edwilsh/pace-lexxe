  <title>Square watermelon the latest craze out of Japan</title>
  <content>
Japan is known for its quirky creations, and they have delivered once again with cube-shaped watermelon.
Selling for up to AU$200 in grocery stores, the square melons are the latest craze taking off in the Land of the Rising Sun.
They measure 15cm long and are grown in custom crates to give them the unnatural shape.
But that is not the only strange shape hitting the shelves, with growers also experimenting with love heart-shaped designs.
