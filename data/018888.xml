  <title>All Sport Show - Episode 25</title>
  <content>
We have a very special All Sport Show today live track side at the Newcastle Jockey Club Spring Carnival from 3pm.
In what is shaping as the biggest day of racing for the year at the Newcastle Jockey Club we will have a heap of special guest joining us to run an eye over the races and talk all things sport.

Former Socceroos David Lowe and former Newcastle Jets Captain Matt Thompson will show off their punting expertise and discuss the season ahead for the Jets.

Will be joined by a number of Newcastle Knights boys and see how they are enjoying the off season.

Top hoop Brentan Avdulla will join us between rides, Kurt Fearnley will bring his dad Glenn on (this could be interesting!) and our good friend Jock Gollogly will be adding some racing expertise to the panel - and don't we need it!

NJC Boss Cameron Williams will also come on and give us a run down on all the fantastic redevelopment work being done at Beautiful Broadmeadow.

No doubt paralympic Champion Rheed McCracken will stick his head too!

So grab your Newcastle Herald form guide and join Kurt Fearnley, Darren Forward & me from 3pm today for 2 hours on the All Sport Show!

WHEN: Friday, Newcastle Jockey Club

TIME: 3pm
YOUR PRESENTERS: ● Brett Keeble, Herald Sport Journalist ● Darren Forward, Local Rugby League Identity ● Ivan Spyrdz
