  <title>Get set for a wild time at school show</title>
  <content>
THE Bare Necessities are being celebrated by Hume Anglican Grammar.
The prep to grade 4 students will perform Disney's The Jungle Book KIDS, playing everything from tigers to trees.
Head of learning-the arts Haylee Sommer said the show was specially adapted from the classic animated film, and featured a host of colourful characters and catchy songs.
Year 5/6 students will perform Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat after the show.
Every student at the school will have a role in one of the plays, which will be staged at the Plenty Ranges Arts and Convention Centre, South Morang, this Wednesday to Friday from 6pm.
