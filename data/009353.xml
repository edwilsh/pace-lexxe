  <title>Trump said to call White House 'real dump'</title>
  <content>
President Donald Trump has told members of his New Jersey golf club he spends so much time away from Washington because the White House is a "real dump".
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the account, which appeared in a lengthy article posted on the website golf.com.
The story on Trump's complicated love for golf also appears in Sports Illustrated magazine.
The story recounts a scene in which Trump was chatting with some club members.
Trump told the members he makes such frequent appearances at the property in Bedminster, New Jersey, because: "That White House is a real dump."
Trump has spent nearly every weekend of his presidency visiting various properties he owns and leases, including Bedminster.
