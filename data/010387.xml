  <title>One Nation breaks electoral laws</title>
  <content>
ONE Nation's Queensland branch has breached electoral laws by failing to keep proper records, the ABC reports.
The broadcaster says it has obtained documents that outline the party's breaches after an investigation by the Electoral Commission of Queensland.
It said the party had failed to disclose some of its spending, had not lodged returns on time, and had failed to notify donors of their disclosure requirements, the ABC said.
