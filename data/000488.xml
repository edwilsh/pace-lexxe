THE CITY of Casey's $125 million Bunjil place development is expected to open on October 28.
Casey Mayor Sam Aziz encouraged residents to put the last weekend in October in their diary, saying there were a number of celebrations planned.
"After many years of planning and construction, we are incredibly excited that we now have a date to welcome the first visitors to this vibrant entertainment precinct," he said.
"With such a diverse and unprecedented mix of facilities, Bunjil Place will offer enriching experiences for all visitors and you will be able to choose how you want to enjoy this remarkable new community space."
Bunjil place will include a plaza for outdoor events, an 800-seat theatre, studio space, gallery and library.
The council offices and the Narre Warren Library will open at Bunjil Place from October 30 and the City of Casey has said there will be no break in council services during the transition from the current Magid Drive Civic Centre.
Bunjil Place received $10 million from the Australian Government and $115 million from the City of Casey.
