  <title>Armed gang rob three service stations in Melbourne</title>
  <content>
A gang of armed thieves are on the run this morning after ransacking three service stations armed with bats and knives in Melbourne's north west on the weekend.
The first robbery occurred at 3am on Saturday when seven men smashed their way into a service station on the Melton Highway in Hillside.
They tried to access the cigarette cabinets but failed and instead took off with the shop attendant's car.
Thirty minutes later the same men targeted another service station in Laverton North. Armed with a knife, baseball bat and hammers the thugs stole cigarettes and a cash register just before 3.30am.
The attendant was forcced to lock himself in a back room. He was uninjured.
The last incident occurred in Rockback at 3.30am on Sunday. Six men armed with hammers stole the cash register and cigarettes before fleeing in a black SUV and a silver sedan.
Attendants and shoppers have been left traumatised by the brazen attacks, which are believed to be linked.
