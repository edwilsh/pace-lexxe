  <title>Bell Potter beats drum for tech company Xref</title>
  <content>
Human resources technology company Xref is in front of fund managers and sophisticated investors on Tuesday, seeking an equity injection with the help of Bell Potter Securities. 
The company's shares went into a trading halt as Bell Potter launched a $6 million share placement. 
The broker was seeking to place shares at 60Â¢ each, which was a 1.6 per cent discount to the last close. 
Funds raised were for marketing and co-promotional activities with "channel partners", according to terms sent to potential investors. 

Xref has an online software platform that allows employers to conduct reference checks on new hires.

The company had a $100.2 million market capitalisation at the last close, on a fully diluted basis. 
Bell Potter was seeking buds by midday on Wednesday.
