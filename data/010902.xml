  <title>Rebels upbeat despite losing pivotal players</title>
  <content>
Experienced Rebels basketballer Marcus Ch'ng believes his team can defend its title in the Men's League Championship season starting tonight, despite the loss of key personnel.
Coach Malix Laurel is on leave for personal reasons, and Travis Ellis and Jake Eyles departing for new team Essington are big losses.
Jamie Hamill will player-coach the team in Laurel's absence.
"We'll lose a bit of strikepower, but our American imports Tim Morris and Spencer Coleman are big-game players," Ch'ng said.
"They will take on more leadership, as well as myself."
Key American big man Tim Morris cannot wait for tomorrow night's blockbuster clash against Challenge season grand final opponents, Eagles.
"There's been a lot of hype and talk going on in the off-season. I've been doing a lot of workouts with Spencer and Fisto (Bizima)," he said.
Preliminary finalists Palmerston also had some key losses in the off-season, with Shaq Hohipa-Wilson and Jesse Bell going to Lightning, and Bizima moving to Essington.
Lightning coach Chris Charman said big Hohipa-Wilson and Bell had brought plenty of energy to off-season training sessions.
Essington will field a strong team in its first Championship campaign.
Reece Hamriding also joined the team from Rebels, and other big-name recruits are big man Karsten Althrop (Razzle) and three-point shooter Lachlan Shipway (Eagles). "Essington juniors now have a pathway - before, they were only able to play in juniors," assistant coach Gary Shipway said.
"They can aspire to play in the league now, and it's good for the competition. We started with three junior teams, and now we have 20 with new kids coming into the sport."
The Eagles will take on Rebels with just six players, but Joe Johnson said he was keen to return to Darwin soon, with his QBL season at the Toowoomba Mountaineers set to finish on Saturday.
TV Jets will field largely the same team which finished sixth in the Challenge season.
And American Rob Skinner has joined Ansett from the Mayne Mustangs college team in exchange for talented Darwin product Freddy Webb.
Round 1 fixtures tonight: Razzle v Essington and TV Jets v Lightning. Tomorrow night: Palmerston v Ansett and Eagles v Uni Rebels.
NT News' predictions: Rebels, Lightning, Ansett, Eagles, Essington, Palmerston, TV Jets, Razzle.
