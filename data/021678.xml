  <title>Fishermen knocked unconscious by whale</title>
  <content>
A whale has slammed into a charter boat in the Whitsundays, knocking two fishermen unconscious.
The RACQ CQ Helciopter was called to rescue four men following the incident on Saturday, off the coast of Bowen, with one man suffering a deep head laceration.
An RACQ CQ crewman said those onboard had been "thrown about the boat" by the "enormous impact" of the collision.
