  <title>Vegemite and other yeast spreads could make you happier, research finds</title>
  <content>
A new study has revealed those who consume yeast-based spreads are less stressed than those who don't dab a little on their toast each morning.
Researchers from Victoria University surveyed 520 people to see how spreads like Pro-mite, Marmite and Vegemite affected the mood of regular consumers.
Results showed that those whose diets did include the spreads had lower stress levels than those who avoided it.

"In addition, those who consumed spreads with (more) added B12 were even less anxious," Professor Vasso Apostolopoulos told 9NEWS.
This is the first time a study has looked at the relationship of yeast-based spreads, and the role they play in stress management.
"The results are very exciting," Prof. Apostolopoulos said.
Nutrition experts told 9NEWS that vitamin B-containing spreads aren't the "be all, end all" in health, and should be eaten as part of a healthy diet.

"Having any of the yeast based spreads in small quantities is fine ... but they're very salty," accredited dietitian Simone Austin advised.
Ms Austin added that it was important to consume B vitamins along with other important nutrients, like Omega-3 fats which are found foods like fish and walnuts.
