  <title>Switching main residences can help you reduce capital gains tax</title>
  <content>
You wrote recently that capital gains tax on a principal residence is forgiven if the owner dies while living in it or presumably in hospital and the property is not income producing at the time. Would this mean that if I were to move to my rental property and it becomes my principal residence and not income-producing at the time of my demise then the beneficiaries would not inherit my CGT liability? Would this also hold true for the six-year CGT exemption rule provided it was still classified as my principal residence and was not income producing?
Yes, it's all true.  You are allowed to use the six-year rule to cover the property even if the property is earning income while the owner is in palliative care. This is provided you first establish it as your main residence and it does not earn income while you are living there. Note you can only have one main residence at a time.
I am 52 years old and am a full-time carer of my mother who is 76. I live with her and am on a carer's pension. She is worried if she has a stroke or gets dementia she will have to move into a nursing home. She is concerned that I will be evicted from our unit if this happens Is this correct? We are both so worried.
There are special exemptions that can apply to the former home for aged care purposes if a "protected person" lives there. The definition of a protected person includes a carer who has been living in the home for at least two years and who is eligible for an income support payment.
Where a protected person is living in the home, the home is not included as an asset for aged care. From a pension perspective, the home may become assessable two years after the pensioner leaves it, so it is important to seek advice to understand the short- and long-term consequences of what may happen in the future.
I have a self-managed super fund (SMSF) and was interested to read your response to a question from a like person in regard to transfer of shares held by the fund to the trustees to meet the required minimum annual pension drawing by June 30, 2017. I did this for the 2015-16 tax year but was advised by my accountant that the Tax Office now requires shares to be sold and not transferred to fund the drawdown. Could you advise if the accountant's advice is correct?

Yes the accountant is correct because APRA and the Tax Office consider that a pension must be "paid" - i.e. the benefit provided in money, and as such an in specie transfer of an asset does not count.  An in specie transfer of an asset could once be used to make a lump sum benefit, and the pensioner could elect to treat the lump sum payment as a payment usually for the purposes of pension minimum.
However, from July 1, 2017, the ability to treat lump sum payments as pension payments was removed, and therefore, an in specie transfer of shares cannot be used to meet the minimum pension requirement.

I am 71 years of age, single, have no super and own my own home. Please advise if cash in the bank is treated as an asset by Centrelink and what is the maximum amount of money I can have in the bank if one is applying for an age pension.
Cash in the bank is treated as an asset for the asset test, and is given a notional deemed income for the income test. For a single home owner, the cut-off point for the assets test is $550,000, which includes possessions such as furniture and motor vehicles. The cut-off point for the income test is $1944.60 per fortnight. If you did have $500,000 of financial assets, and $49,000 of chattels, your deemed income would be only $596 a fortnight which means you would be asset tested.
