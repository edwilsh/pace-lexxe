  <title>Brisbane fog delays ferries, airport spared</title>
  <content>
Brisbane's ferries have been delayed as a fog descends on the city but the airport, under pressure from anti-terror measures, looks to have escaped the worst of it.
Forecasters said the fog was widespread over much of south-east Queensland on Monday morning but in Brisbane it was confined mostly to the south and west, away from the airport.Photo: Bianca Stone - 7 News Queensland
But it was affecting the CityCat network, with ferries in both directions delayed up to 10 minutes from Northshore Hamilton to the University of Queensland.
Translink announced the delays about 6.45am.
Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Harry Clark said the low cloud had limited visibility to about 150 metres at its thickest.
The fog was expected to burn off throughout the morning, with the temperature in Brisbane rising to 26, a degree less on the Gold and Sunshine coasts and up to 27 degrees in Ipswich.
after police arrested four men in terror raids in Sydney.
The Brisbane Airport warned travellers to arrive two hours before domestic flights and three hours before international departures, in line with recommendations across the country.
