THERE'S plenty happening on the Sunshine Coast sports scene. Here's a few things you may not know about.
MX title chance
MOTOR SPORT: The 10th and final round of the MX Nationals will be held at Coolum Beach later this month but the prized MX1 title could be claimed at the penultimate round on the Darling Downs on Sunday. "Dean Ferris, our defending champ, mathematically speaking has the opportunity to wrap up the title at Toowoomba which hasn't happened for a number of years," series promoter Kevin Williams said.
Hodgson triumphs
SAILING: James Hodgson has won the Club Marine NSW Youth Match Racing Championship which was held on Sydney Harbour. Racing with a new crew combination drawn from the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia's youth academy, the 18-year-old had to battle Sydney skipper Tom Grimes to win two-up in the best of three final. The Sunshine Coast youth team of Taylor Rogers with crew Eamon Kriz and Sarah Johnson finished in ninth place out of the 10 national teams.
Rankings change
SURFING: Keely Andrew has lost a spot on the Championship Tour standings following the seventh of 10 events. She's 12th and is outside the automatic cut-off for re-qualifying for 2017 (the top-10). Andrew was 13th at the event at the US Open of Surfing, which was won by Sage Erickson. The American beat Hawaii's Tatiana Weston-Webb in the final. Australian Tyler Wright leads the rankings.
State selection
HOCKEY: Buderim duo Alex Breytenbach, Dean Ryan and Eudlo's Angus Sinclair are in the Queensland under-18 men's squad after outstanding performances at the state championships at Toowoomba. The squad is set to be put through its paces at trials in February, when a final team will be announced for the Australian championships in April.
