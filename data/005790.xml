  <title>Mum forced to sleep in car by</title>
  <content>
A woman who claims she was driven out of her own home by squatters has revealed the damage she says they left behind.
Mum Alesha says she advertised some rooms in her home for rent, hoping it would help pay her mortgage.
However, she said she soon found herself locked out of her home by a group of people who refused to pay rent or vacate the property.
Allegedly reduced to sleeping in her car, Alesha called A Current Affair for help.
After being questioned by A Current Affair and Alesha at the house in question, the accused squatters left.
However, Alesha said she had been left with more heartache, with her house ransacked and damaged.
"They took most of the furniture away," she said.

She said the former residents had still tried to bar some doors to her, even to the point of drilling holes in the locks.
Alesha claims they also had taken a leather sofa, a dining table and chairs, two antique coffee tables and even her cocktail glasses.
She said she had no idea where the alleged squatters had gone, but she hoped sharing her story would stop them doing the same with another homeowner.
She has reported the damage and missing furniture to the police.
