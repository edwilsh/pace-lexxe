  <title>Vic recycling plant handed back after fire</title>
  <content>
More than a fortnight after a Melbourne recycling plant was engulfed by fire, emergency crews have handed the site back to operators.
Metropolitan Fire Brigade crews left the suburban Coolaroo plant on Tuesday morning and passed control back to managers SKM Recycing.
Four people were hospitalised and more than 100 homes evacuated after the plant caught fire on July 13 and continued to smoulder for days.
