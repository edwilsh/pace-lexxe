  <title>Bumbag of drugs dumped under car</title>
  <content>
Police are on the hunt for a man after a bumbag full of drugs was ditched under a car in Beresfield on Wednesday morning.
The bumbag contained what police believed was methamphetamine, five ecstacy tablets and a set of electronic scales.

The methamphetamine was stored inside three resealable bags which had a combined weight of 31 grams. 

The bumbag discovery came after police spotted a white Hyundai Excel in Yarrum Avenue about 1am.

Police pulled up behind the vehicle after it stopped in front of a house.
Two men got out of the car before the male passenger fell to the ground. 
Unknown to police at the time, the 34-year-old man allegedly placed the bumbag under the vehicle before he got up and walked into a house.
Police found the bumbag after the man left the scene.

Officers went to the home to try and arrest the man, but he was not there.
The 32-year-old driver of the vehicle was released without penalty.
Police inquiries continue into the matter.
