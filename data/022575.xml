  <title>Bus driver charged after cars vandalised with acid</title>

Police have charged a Sydney bus driver over alleged acid attacks on cars parked at a university and a shopping centre in Sydney's north-west.
The 53-year-old allegedly poured an acid-like substance on cars at Macquarie University and the Macquarie Centre between February and June.
Officers arrested the man at a home in Ryde on Friday and took him to Ryde police station where he was charged with 16 counts of malicious damage.
Examination of the cars found that the acid-like substance had caused the paint to be stripped from the affected areas.
Superintendent Stephen Egginton told reporters in Sydney on Monday the man was identified with the help of photographs taken by a victim.
"We were able to identify the offender as being a bus driver and that linked into the times of the offences across the areas where they occurred," he said.
"It's important members of the community feel they can report these matters to us, because the early indications were that there was a reluctance from some ... to come forward."
He said the substance was yet to be tested and detectives were considering all potential motives, including whether the attacks were racially motivated.
Detectives are also working to put together a potential damage bill from the crimes.
The man has been granted bail and is scheduled to appear at Burwood Local Court on August 21.
Police were alerted to the alleged vandalism earlier this year after drivers shared their experiences on a Chinese-language forum before setting up a support group on the Chinese social media platform WeChat.
The alleged incidents were reported to Macquarie University and the Macquarie Centre and police from the Ryde Local Area Command commenced an investigation.
