  <title>Police chief awarded after Ruszczyk shooting</title>
  <content>
Ousted Minneapolis police chief Janee Harteau, who remained on holidays in the aftermath of the fatal police shooting of Australia's Justine Ruszczyk, has won an award.
Ms Harteau was named the 2017 Woman Law Enforcement Executive of the Year on Thursday.
The former chief resigned after Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges announced less than a week after Ms Ruszczyk's death she had "lost confidence in the chief's ability to lead us further".
Ms Ruszczyk, a 40-year-old life coach originally from Sydney's northern beaches, called 911 just before midnight on July 15 after she thought she heard a woman near her Minneapolis home being raped.

Officer Mohamed Noor arrived in a patrol car and shot Ms Ruszczyk dead as she approached the driver's side window.
Officer Noor and his partner did not have their body or dash cameras on.
Ms Harteau continued her holiday for four days instead of immediately returning to Minneapolis after Ms Ruszczyk's death.

The former chief told reporters she was "backpacking in the mountains" and "had intermittent phone service".
She received the award at the annual conference of National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives in Kansas City.
"Chief Janee Harteau has made a real difference for the police officers and citizens of Minneapolis, and those she has touched through her various teaching, mentoring and speaking engagements," NAWLEE officials said in a statement.
