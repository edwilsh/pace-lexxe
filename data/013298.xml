  <title>Success no 'shaw thing on Himalayan odyssey</title>
  <content>
RIDING across the Himalayas in a four-stroke rickshaw is not something most people would classify as fun.
But when it was for charity, Donovan Fantasia thought he had to get on board.
"It's not often you get to do something in this day and age that no one else has done," he said.
"And it'll be fun and we get to raise money for charity while we're having fun."
Mr Fantasia will team up with fellow adventurer Alan Morgan as they trek from Shimla to Leh in India.
"The highest point we get to will be 5300m so it will be pretty cold up there," Mr Fantasia said. "I don't know if the engine will run properly. If it doesn't, I'll have to tie a rope to my waist and pull the rickshaw."
The duo have named themselves the "Bums of Anarchy", due to an expectation of contracting Delhi belly.
"We've also got sponsorship from a recycled toilet paper company," Mr Fantasia said.
The pair will compete against 10 other teams to travel the journey the fastest. They've been given seven days to make the trek.
To kickstart the fundraising for the Indigenous Literacy Foundation, an event will be held tomorrow night.
