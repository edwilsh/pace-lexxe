  <title>New Hobart flight adds weight to AFP calls</title>
  <content>
The return of direct flights between Hobart and Adelaide strengthens the case for AFP officers at Tasmania's biggest airport, the state's premier Will Hodgman says.
Jetstar announced on Monday flights between the two state capitals three times a week would start in mid-November.
It's the first time in seven years Hobart and Adelaide have been directly linked after fellow budget airline Tiger canned their service due to a lack of demand.
Flights will run on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, with 55,000 people expected to fly per year.
Mr Hodgman hailed the cutting of travel times as a win for tourism.
"It does also strengthen the case for Tasmania to have a permanent AFP presence here," he said.
AFP officers were withdrawn in late 2014 but Mr Hodgman said that arrangement would "change" if Tasmania's security risk increased.
