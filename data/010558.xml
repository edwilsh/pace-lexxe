  <title>Trump's 'greatest speech ever' claim disputed by Boy Scouts as White House goes into damage control</title>
  <content>
Washington DC: President Donald Trump looks to have made another fantastic statement about one of his speeches.

After someone from the Journal suggested Trump got a "mixed" reaction for his speech, Trump - as he often does - seemed to overcompensate.
"I got a call from the head of the Boy Scouts saying it was the greatest speech that was ever made to them, and they were very thankful," Trump said in the interview obtained by Politico. "So there was - there was no mix."Photo: AP
Except a source for the Scouts said this doesn't appear to have happened at all. "We are not aware of any call from national BSA leadership to the White House," the source said.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Wednesday tried to clear up the confusion about that phone call, and another, supposedly from the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, praising US immigration policy.

"The conversations took place," Sanders told reporters at a White House briefing. "They just simply didn't take place over a phone call. ... He had them in person."

Trump said in The Wall Street Journal interview that he had received a call after his July 24 appearance at the National Boy Scouts Jamboree in West Virginia, where his speech drew heavy criticism because it was laced with political rhetoric.
"I got a call from the head of the Boy Scouts saying it was the greatest speech that was ever made to them, and they were very thankful," Trump told The Journal.
An official with the Scouts said Wednesday that the organisation was not aware of such a phone call. Last week, Michael Surbaugh, the chief scout executive of the Boy Scouts, wrote to parents that he "regrets that politics were inserted into the Scouting program."
Sanders told reporters Wednesday that Trump was referring to in-person conversations with "multiple members of the Boy Scout leadership, following his speech there that day," who she said "congratulated him, praised him and offered quite powerful compliments following his speech."'
In a separate episode, Trump on Monday spoke of a call from Mexico after swearing in his new chief of staff, John Kelly, who previously served as Secretary of Homeland Security.
"Even the President of Mexico called me," Trump said with reporters present in the Oval Office. "Their southern border, they said very few people are coming because they know they're not going to get to our border, which is the ultimate compliment."
A statement issued later by the Mexican President's office disputed that account, saying: "President Enrique Pena Nieto has not been in recent communication via telephone with President Donald Trump."
Sanders told reporters on Wednesday that Trump was referring to an in-person conversation with the Mexican President that took place last month at the Group of 20 Summit in Hamburg.
"On Mexico, he was referencing the conversation that they had had at the G-20 Summit, where they specifically talked about the issues that he referenced," Sanders said.
She was pressed by a reporter about whether Trump had lied.
"I wouldn't say it was a lie," Sanders said. "That's a pretty bold accusation."
