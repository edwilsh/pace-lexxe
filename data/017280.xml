  <title>Homicide squad investigates body in farm</title>
  <content>
A prominent member of a small NSW farming community may have been murdered, police believe.
Police and paramedics found Matthew Dunbar, 42, dead in his home at Thunderbolts Way at Walcha at 2am on Wednesday.
Homicide squad detectives were brought in to the case late on Friday, police told AAP.
Friends paid their respects to a "caring" and "humble" Mr Dunbar online. He was well known in Walcha.
"This is so sad, Mathew was a great person, very humble and kind with a heart of gold," one friend said.
"Heaven has opened its door to a very special angel. RIP my friend Matt."
A post-mortem examination will be conducted and police will prepare a report for the coroner.
