Detective Sergeant Mark Steel said the sting had resulted in nine seizures of party drug MDMA and 10 seizures of cocaine.
"We want everyone to enjoy themselves without putting themselves at risk with illicit drugs," he said.
"Not only is it illegal, but also unsafe. You never know what you are ingesting, and how those chemicals will affect you."
Sergeant Steel warned that police would continue targeting illicit drug use in the city, and encouraged anyone with information to come forward.
A number of individuals were arrested following the drug busts and will appear in court at a later date on charges including possession and sale and supply.
Anyone with information should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
