In Her Time

BEN Smith is eyeing the Premiere Stakes at Randwick or AJ Moir Stakes at Moonee Valley as an Everest trial for In Her Time after her better-than-expected return from a short break. 
The Broadmeadow trainer had said he would take the five-year-old mare first-up into the Manikato Stakes (1200m) on October 27, despite the attraction of pushing claims earlier for a slot in the October 14 $10 million The Everest (1200m).
However, Smith said plans had changed after In Her Time's impressive development since her third in the June 24 Tattersall's Tiara.

"She's going to do a little bit of gallop work on the course proper in the morning and at this stage we're looking at the Premiere on September 30 or the Moir in Melbourne on September 29," Smith said of the two-time group 2 winner. "She's just come up so well, I think we're going to have to give her a run before the Manikato."
The change gives In Her Time the chance to make a late Everest play.
"Over the next two weeks or so, a lot of horses will be coming back, so I think they've put everything on hold to see how they go," Smith said of slot-holders yet to declare a runner.
Meanwhile, Smith had his fingers crossed for first-starter Floki at Scone in race two (1000m maiden) on Tuesday.
"The distance tomorrow might be a bit short for him but if he can transfer his trackwork and trial form to raceday, I think he'll make a nice horse."
He said Bengalla Cup winner Anecdote would next head to the Hopkins Livermore Cup (1400m) at Taree on August 18.
