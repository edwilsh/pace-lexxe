  <title>Sydney terrorism raids: What we know about those held over alleged plot to bomb a plane</title>
  <content>
Police continue to collect evidence at five properties in Sydney today as they try to piece together the details of an alleged plot to blow up a plane.
Four people were arrested in raids across Sydney on Saturday after counter-terrorism authorities became aware of plans for an alleged terrorist attack using a homemade bomb.
A senior police source has told the ABC the four being held in custody include father and son Khaled and Mahmoud Khayat, with one taken into custody at Wiley Park and the other at Lakemba.
The two other men who were arrested, Khaled and Abdul Merhi, are believed to be related, but it is unclear how.
The ABC understands police are confident they have arrested all members of the alleged terrorist cell.
"We're certainly assured we have minimised the threat," they said.
Here's what we know about those who were arrested and the locations of the raids.
Australian Federal Police (AFP) Commissioner Andrew Colvin said it was an ongoing operation.
"In recent days, law enforcement has been become aware of information that suggested some people in Sydney were planning to commit a terrorist attack using an IED [improvised explosive device]," he said.
"At this time, we don't have a great deal of information on the specific attack, the location, date or time, however, we're investigating information indicating the aviation industry was potentially a target of that attack."

What do we know about those arrested?

in Sydney's inner city and south-western suburbs.

All four men are being held at the Sydney Police Centre in Surry Hills and they can be held without charge for about a week.
During that time, police will search their homes for documents, computers and electronic devices in order to gather evidence and build a picture of the allegations against the group.
"There are four people in custody, we have not charged any of those individuals as yet, and I don't want to speculate on potential charges," Commissioner Colvin said.
"The investigation is at a very early stage of its process. We commenced searches in five premises overnight, in suburbs of Surry Hills, Lakemba, Punchbowl, and Wiley Park.
"There were two searches in Punchbowl, four of those are ongoing, and we anticipate they will be ongoing for many hours, if not days. This is the start of a very long and protracted investigation."
Police said there was the potential for further arrests.
What do we know about the locations of the raids?

ASIO as well as federal and state police officers are continuing to comb five properties and assess evidence and it is expected they will continue to do so for at least the next two or three days.

Police found materials and items that could be used to make a homemade bomb during anti-terrorism raids on a house near Goodlet Lane at Surry Hills in Sydney, the ABC has been told.
Other raids were held at Renown Avenue in Wiley Park, at Sproule Street in Lakemba, and at Victoria Road in Punchbowl.
Authorities received information about the alleged plot on Wednesday and they proceeded to beef up security at Sydney Airport on Thursday.
The NSW Joint Counter Terrorism Team decided to move ahead with raids on Saturday evening.
