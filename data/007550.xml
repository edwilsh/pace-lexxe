THE Townsville Bulletin is on a shortlist to be named daily newspaper of the year.
The News Corp Australia-owned paper, established in 1881, serves Townsville and the northern Queensland region.
It will compete against other regional finalists including the Gold Coast Bulletin and Newcastle Herald for the Pacific Area Newspaper Publishers' Association award.
Staff at the Bulletin are also on a shortlist to win prestigious media awards.
Photographer Wesley Monts is among the regional finalists in the photography section for his work Glaucus.
Mr Monts is also a regional finalist in the features and lifestyle category for his photo titled SES Rescue.
His colleague, Zak Simmonds, is a regional finalist in the news category for his work Crim Reality.
"I'm thrilled that the hard work our entire team puts in day in day out is being recognised in this way," editor Ben English said.
"We strive to publish what matters to our readers and to the entire region.
"I'm proud of every member of our newsroom. I'd put them up against any in the country."
The Townsville Print Centre, also owned by News Corp Australia, is a finalist for the Print Centre of the Year Award.
The Bulletin is also a regional finalist in the technical excellence section of the awards.
