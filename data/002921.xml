  <title>Sampson's body on the line again</title>

A SECOND season of Body Hack featuring Todd Sampson will air on Channel 10 in 2018 after receiving funding support from Screen Australia.
The documentary series, which is written and produced by Sampson, was one of 15 projects to receive a share of $4.15 million in production investment from Australia's peak film body yesterday.
While the first season of the series - in which Sampson pushes his body to the limits to better understand the human body - aired last October, Network 10 confirmed the second season would not air until 2018.
Body Hack peaked at 660,000 metro viewers last year during the episode in which Sampson trained with the French Foreign Legion.

Newly-announced Foxtel series Uncharted with Sam Neill also benefited from Screen Australia funding yesterday.
The celebrated New Zealand actor will retrace Captain James Cook's travels throughout the Pacific in the six-episode series to mark the 250th anniversary of his first voyage to Australia.
"Of particular fascination to me are those initial awkward, often funny, sometimes tragic first encounters. We are looking at Cook, but we are also looking at the before and after of Cook. We are people of the Pacific, and this is our story as well," Neill said.
Other projects to receive funding were documentaries pegged for the ABC about politician Bob Hawke and the Great Barrier Reef.
Meanwhile Beyond Entertainment will produce a theatrical documentary about Australian band Midnight Oil.
