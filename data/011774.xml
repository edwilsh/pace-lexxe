  <title>Cricket Australia and players sign peace deal to end pay war</title>
  <content>
Australian cricket's long and ugly pay dispute is finally over, with Cricket Australia and the players finally agreeing on a peace deal on Thursday afternoon.

The negotiating teams from CA and the Australian Cricketers' Association had worked long in the night throughout this week to settle their remaining differences in the drafting of a heads of agreement, as the troubled talks threatened to go off course again. They were at last able to find middle ground on Thursday. An announcement in a media conference is expected this afternoon at 4:30pm in Melbourne.
The long-awaited deal on the game's next five-year memorandum of understanding between the governing body and players arrives just in the nick of time to save this month's two-Test series between Australia and Bangladesh. It also ensures that this summer's Ashes series in Australia will go ahead, as will an Australian limited-overs tour of India in October.
Steve Smith's squad is due to assemble in Darwin for a training camp next week before taking off to the subcontinent for a series that they were refusing to play in had there not been a new MOU agreed.
The members of the Test team are among 230 players who have been out of contract and not paid since the last agreement elapsed on June 30.
