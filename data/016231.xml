  <title>Chris Hadfield wants Australia to look up</title>
  <content>
Singing astronaut Chris Hadfield thinks Australia should get more involved in the space race.
The Canadian space traveller rocketed to fame for his videoed version of David Bowie's Space Oddity filmed onboard the International Space Station.
Since its release, and Hadfield's return to earth, he's been involved in several projects; writing books, appearing on TV shows and has even released an album, all advocating for space travel.
He sees advancements into space as an inevitability, comparing space tourism to the unstoppable growth of transport and communication.
"The Wright brothers had a crazy idea and it took a while from their first flight in 1903, it was decades before there were commercial flights and they were only for the very wealthy. It was really into the 50s before the technology was good enough and more people could do it," Hadfield told AAP.
"Now of course the technology is so simple and reliable that air travel is almost common place but that took a long time and space travel, I think, will follow the same pattern."
He believes Australia is delaying the inevitable by not getting more involved in the space race, as entrepreneurs such as Richard Branson and Elon Musk get closer to getting the first space tourists into orbit.
The country has been used for decades by agencies including NASA and the European Space Agency, who have launched rockets at the Woomera Range in South Australia.
But Australia has yet to establish its own space agency.
"I think to deny it is really just to delay it, it's like asking 'should we get telephones in 1890?' or 'should we get television in 1945?' or 'should we get the internet in 1985?'," he asked.
"You can say that's a fad or a passing thing but the access to space has fundamentally affected almost every single life on the surface of the earth: our ability to understand and predict the weather, to communicate with each other, or GPS something has crept into everything," he said.
*Chris Hadfield tour dates:
August, 22 - Great Hall, BCEC, Brisbane
August 24 - State Theatre, Sydney
August 25 - Palais Theatre, Melbourne
