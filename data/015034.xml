"It's 2.40am and there are no barricades in front of me...we are on!"
After years of having to wear the Dullsville tag, a bloke with the surname Dullard put that unfortunate Perth label to rest entirely this morning...or maybe he just enhanced it.
Either way, it's well worth a watch.
The opening of the new 6km extension to Perth's Mitchell Freeway this morning attracted politicians from far and wide, including Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
But none were as delighted as Corey Dullard, who with his friend Kenneth camped out in the early hours of the morning, to be the first people on the stretch of road extending the freeway from Burns Beach Road to Hester Avenue in Clarkson.
And to make it even better, they broadcast the maiden venue on Facebook Live.
"Oh my gosh...we are on the new freeway and I can't f***king believe it," Mr Dullard said.
"We did it, we stayed up all f***king night...this has been wonderful."
Yep, we think we can safely say he's excited.
For what it's worth, the project, started by the Barnett government cost $236 million and was 80 per cent funded by the Federal Government.
It's been predicted to deliver travel times of 60 per cent less on average and to stimulate further investment in Perth's north.
Not to mention Mr Dullard.
