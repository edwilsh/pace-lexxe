  <title>AWD Hobart leaves Adelaide</title>
  <content>
The first of Australia's new air warfare destroyers has left Adelaide bound for its home port of Sydney.
The Hobart powered down the Port River on Sunday, taking just 20 minutes to reach Outer Harbor and the waters of Gulf St Vincent.
It is the first of three to be built in Adelaide which will become the most advanced warships in the Australian Navy's fleet.
The 6250-tonne destroyer was officially handed over to the government at a ceremony in June and is about to go into full service.
The second ship, the Brisbane, is due to be handed over late next year and the Sydney in 2020.
The Hobart will have a crew of 186, a top speed of 28 knots and a range of 5000 nautical miles, or more than 9000km.
It has been produced by defence shipbuilder ASC, which says its workers have delivered the navy a potent new air warfare capability.
The Hobart completed all its sea trials with flying colours earlier this year.
