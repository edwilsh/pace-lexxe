  <title>Veteran Lib calls for dual citizen revamp</title>
  <content>
Veteran Liberal Kevin Andrews has called for constitutional change to dual citizenship rules that have claimed the scalps of at least two parliamentarians.
Writing in The Australian on Thursday, the former Abbott and Howard government minister says it's time to revisit recommendations of two previous parliamentary committees that have called for section 44 of the constitution to be deleted.
Greens senators Scott Ludlam and Larissa Waters quit parliament after learning they were dual citizens, while government senator Matt Canavan was forced to resign from cabinet amid uncertainty over his Italian dual citizenship.
