  <title>Marlins bounce back</title>
  <content>
THE Cairns Marlins have booked a home date with USC Rip City in the opening week of the QBL finals.
The defending champions split their Round 15 road trip, beaten by Rockhampton on Saturday night before bouncing back and knocking over Gladstone Port City Power yesterday.
The Marlins led by as much as 17 on Saturday night at Hegvold Stadium before being overrun by the James Mitchell-led Rockets, who clinched their finals berth with the victory.
The Jamie Pearlman-coached Marlins finished the QBL season with a 11-6 record, leaving them fourth on the ladder, and will now host the Rip on Saturday night at home.
In Monday's Cairns Post, it was reported the Marlins would play Townsville away in the first week of the finals after Basketball Queensland provided incorrect information.
Townsville will instead play South West Metro Pirates in the first week of the finals.
In Gladstone yesterday, Marlins co-captain Damon Heuir landed 25 points while Kuany Kuany got better as the game went on, finishing with 20 points and eight rebounds to finish the regular season with a victory.
Heuir is unlikely to become the QBL MVP after Power import Ray Willis exploded for 37 in their loss yesterday afternoon and would have done enough to seal the individual honour for season 2017.
Meanwhile, the Dolphins crashed out of finals contention as they dropped both games in Round 15.
The Dolphins needed two victories to end their almost decade-long finals absence but could not overcome the Cyclones and Power.
After looking like certain finalists midway through 2017, the Dolphins could not salvage a win in the final six games of the season and dropped outside the top eight.
"Credit to the girls, we started very lacklustre against Gladstone but we dug in the second half and played with some pride," Dolphins coach Mark Worthington said.
