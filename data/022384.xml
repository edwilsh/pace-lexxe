  <title>Dugan 'given every hope' for Dragons' NRL game against Titans</title>

Chance: Josh Dugan could play against the Gold Coast.
JOSH Dugan will be given every chance to play against the Gold Coast on Saturday after MRI scans revealed the "best possible result".

Dragons head of athletic performance Nathan Pickworth said Dugan avoided any "syndesmosis" damage after limping off during the shock loss to South Sydney at the SCG.
Dugan was forced to watch the rest of the game from the dressing sheds, with his foot in a bucket of ice and water, as Souths surged late to win 26-24.
"(Scans) revealed he has got some damage to his lateral ligaments," Pickworth said. 
"We're fortunate that those ligaments can settle down pretty quickly.
"So we'll just see how he goes during the week and giving him every chance to play."  
Dugan has moved to the centres following Matt Dufty's stunning debut at fullback. 
He has signed to play with Cronulla this season after prolonged contract stand-off with the Dragons.
