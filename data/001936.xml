Awabakal chief executive Rob Russell at the Newcastle Post Office.

THE chief executive of the Awabakal Aboriginal Land Council will begin talks with the state government in a bid to speed up a decision on some of its outstanding land claims.

The land council is currently in the process of withdrawing its claim over land earmarked for a $5 million upgrade of Newcastle's basketball headquarters.
The Newcastle Herald reported in May that the government-funded upgrade was being held up by the claim, made by a previous Awabakal regime.
Awabakal chief executive Rob Russell said the members had voted to withdraw the claim because the land council "didn't want to get in the way" of the development.
But he said other outstanding claims - like the one over the Kind Edward Park headland - would be the subject of negotiations with the Department of Primary Industries.

Mr Russell said the government is engaging directly with the land council in an attempt to "prioritise" certain applications.
