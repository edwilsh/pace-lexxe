  <title>Road rage punch up disrupts traffic</title>
  <content>
A vicious road rage fight in Perth's south has been caught on camera.
Traffic was brought to a standstill on Armadale Road in Forrestdale this morning when two men got out of their cars and began swinging punches at each other.
Arms and legs flew and one man was pressed up against as the pair slugged it out in the middle of the road about 8.30am.
The fight only ended when the men wrestled each other to a stalemate.
Nearby residents say there have been crashes and other problems at the intersection of Armadale and Nicholson roads for years.
The men involved in this morning's fight have not been identified and it is not known if either was injured.
