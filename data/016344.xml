  <title>Man stabbed in Bunbury CBD</title>
  <content>
A VICIOUS fight that left a man with stab wounds has been captured on camera in the centre of Bunbury.
Police say three men had arranged to meet outside The Rose Hotel about 4.30pm on Thursday.
But the meeting quickly turned violent when one man stabbed another with scissors.
A concerned passerby filmed the fight, which allegedly shows one man being stabbed after he was pushed to the ground.

"They were throwing punches at each other, yelling, swearing and carrying on," one witness, who did not want to be named, said.
Police cordoned off the scene outside the pub as detectives investigated.
The 23-year-old stab victim was taken to hospital and treated for cuts to his shoulder.
Two men, a 45-year-old man and a 38-year-old, have been charged over the alleged assault and will appear in court at a later date.
