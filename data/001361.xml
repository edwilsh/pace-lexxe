  <title>Tas drug legalisation backed by ex-judge</title>
  <content>
A former Tasmanian chief magistrate has backed a report which calls on the state to decriminalise illegal drugs and increase rehabilitation funding.
Community Legal Centres Tasmania on Monday released a study advocating a health-based approach to tackle the state's "failing" war on drugs.
It's been supported by ex-judge Michael Hill, who says low-range offenders will have better prospects of rehabilitation if they are kept out of the criminal justice system.
