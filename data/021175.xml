  <title>ANU Union to relaunch in 2018 after coming to agreement with ANU</title>

The Australian National University and ANU Union have patched up their differences and come to an agreement outside the courtroom - but both parties are keeping quiet on what exactly the deal means.

The union last month took the ANU to the ACT Supreme Court after failing to come to an agreement on its new location.
"The ANU Union and the university are pleased to announce that they have come to an agreement to help move towards the relaunch [of] the ANU Union with an exciting new operation program from 2018," this week's joint statement said.
"This agreement will allow the ANU Union to continue to provide services to students.
"Businesses previously located in the Union Building including Unicycles and Vodafone have already opened in the ANU pop-up village, with the Campus Bakery and Uni Corner Cafe scheduled to open shortly."

Requests for further details, including what services the ANU Union would provide to students given , were unanswered. It is also unclear where the ANU Union will be based.
ANU Union chairman Tom Lindenmayer has previously stated the body's support for the Union Court redevelopment but argued the project should not come at the cost of the organisation.

"Obviously I can't give any details of the deal at this stage," he said.
"I would like to say though that this agreement will secure a future for the ANU Union, allowing it the opportunity to continue providing services to students."
The Union Court redevelopment - the first stage of which will cost $220 million - will add more classrooms, bars, accommodation and event spaces to the university.
The ambitious project was previously halted by The Gods Cafe and Bar, also booted from its site. The ANU and The Gods also reached an agreement outside court last month.
The university distributed a notice on Friday to let students know there would be no access to Union Court from Monday. Chifley Library will remain open throughout the project, due for completion in 2019.
Demolition work has already started on the Manning Clarke Centre, Arts Centre and Concessions Building.

The Union Court Australia Post Office stopped operating last week and will re-open in the pop-up village in about six weeks.
