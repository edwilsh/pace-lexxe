Garden Ramble Map 2015

Spring in all its glory will be nowhere better on display than at Maitland's fast approaching garden ramble.
The ever popular annual event is a time for garden enthusiasts and lovers of nature to meander through a selection of eight gardens, some of the best in the region.
The ramble offers a visual feast of colour, sights and sounds giving participants plenty of inspiration for their own gardens.
Organisers Maitland Black and White Committee is expecting the weekend ramble will again attract more than 3000 people.
Spectacular gardens at locations scattered across the city will be open on Saturday, September 16 and Sunday, September 17 from 10am to 4pm.
The Royal Horticultural Society will be at a garden in Regent Street, Maitland which is open on both days of the event.
On the Sunday of the event from 1pm, talks will be given on growing and caring for roses at the Belmore Road, Lorn garden.
Gardens will also be located throughout Morpeth, Raworth, Woodville and East Maitland. 
All money raised from the ramble will go to Vision Australia Hunter Division.
A cafe, barbecue and gift stalls are available at selected gardens.
Limited seats are available on the shuttle bus departing each day from Maitland Station at 9.45am.
Tickets are available at each garden, Maitland Tourist Information Centre, Heritage Gardens Nursery and Bolwarra Cafe. Costs are adults $35 and aged concession $25; shuttle bus and ticket $45 and concession $35 and $5 an individual garden.
The successful 2013 Maitland Garden Ramble raised $28,000. More than $1,000,000 has been raised for Vision Australia since the Maitland Black and White committee's inception.
The annual Maitland Garden Ramble is a chance for everyone to meander through some of the area's most beautiful gardens.
Maitland Black and White Committee organises this popular regional event with money raised going to Vision Australia Hunter Division.
Maitland Black and White Committee conducts the ramble as one of two big fundraisers each year. 

The ramble raises over $30,000 on average while its annual luncheon contributes about $25,000.
