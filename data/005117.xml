  <title>NSW dad in court on firearms charges</title>
  <content>
A Sydney man will remain behind bars after he allegedly pointed a handgun at his young daughter and pulled the trigger.
The 32-year-old's matter was mentioned at Burwood Local Court on Tuesday after police found footage allegedly showing him pulling the trigger and also allowing the four-year-old girl to play with the weapon.
NSW Police say the gun - a Colt .45 calibre pistol - did not discharge.
Officers seized two Colts, a .25 calibre Walther pistol and a Bentley 12-gauge shotgun from properties in Sydney's southwest as part of their investigation, NSW Police previously said in a statement.
"Police also accessed mobile phone video footage which allegedly shows the man skylarking with one of the Colt .45 handguns."
The father, who can't be named for legal reasons, did not appear in court on Tuesday and did not apply for bail.
His lawyer, Eidan Havas, outside court asked for "the community to keep an open mind before casting the stone against my client".
