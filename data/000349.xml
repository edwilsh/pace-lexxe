  <title>Australia's interest rates aren't as stimulatory as RBA thinks</title>

No rate hike: RBA

Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe says the RBA does not need to move in lockstep with other central banks.

And if markets and analysts are right, that means there's less stimulus in the economy than the Reserve Bank of Australia thinks, even before factoring in the tightening effect of a rampaging currency.
While the board will likely leave its official cash rate unchanged at a record-low 1.5 per cent on Tuesday, the release of the neutral estimate almost two weeks ago sent the Aussie dollar soaring in the belief policy makers were laying the ground to tighten.Photo: AAP
It was only after  and  used speeches to dismiss the significance of the rate's inclusion in the July minutes that the frenzy briefly eased.
The RBA estimated the neutral cash rate at 3.5 per cent: equivalent to a real rate of 1 per cent plus the 2.5 per cent midpoint of its inflation target.

But it's notable that CPI hasn't reached that midpoint since mid-2014; indeed five-year inflation swaps show 2 per cent is a more realistic average for inflation, which would provide a neutral rate of 3 per cent. The median of 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was similarly 3 per cent.

The lower neutral estimate suggests that while policy is still loose in Australia, it's not as loose as a 3.5 per cent rate would imply.Photo: Bloomberg
Meanwhile, the Aussie dollar has jumped more than 7 per cent on a trade-weighted basis since June 1.
Paul Bloxham, chief economist for Australia at HSBC Holdings, estimates a 5 per cent increase in the TWI is equivalent to a quarter-point rate increase.
Australia's headline inflation came in at a lower than expected 1.9 per cent last quarter, missing the bottom of the central bank's target, which also shows the cash rate is less stimulatory on a real basis.
Meanwhile, the spiralling currency is likely to cut the cost of imports, further curbing consumer-price growth.
And for borrowers, the record-low cash rate doesn't reflect reality.
Following the introduction of lending curbs and other measures by regulators to cool the housing market and investor lending in particular, the gap between the average mortgage rate and the official cash rate has widened to 3.5 percentage points.
