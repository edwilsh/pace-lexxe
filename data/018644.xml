  <title>Tributes for a young life taken too soon</title>
  <content>
The NT Rugby Union community is grieving the death of a star junior player who was struck down with illness while representing the Territory in Queensland.
There has been and outpouring of loving tributes for 13-year-old Thomas Snell.
The much-loved Acacia Hills teenager, son of proud parents Phillip and Amanda, was competing for the Northern Territory at the under 14 Queensland State Rugby Union championships when he took ill three weeks ago.
He was rushed to the Lady Cilento Hospital in Brisbane, where he was put on life support. Sadly, he died on July 22.
A celebration of his life was held on Tuesday at the Thorak cemetery.
Thomas's mother, Amanda, yesterday urged others to keep vigilant for signs of sepsis.
"It is a hidden killer," she said. "There was not a mark on him."
She said a foundation in Thomas' name would be set up to help promote awareness of sepsis and the dangers it posed.
Relative Yvette Clake said Thomas was a good mate to numerous friends through school and sport in the rural community and beyond.
She told on Facebook of his brave battle to survive. In a deeply moving account, she thanked the scores of people who "sent love, prayers and support over the past three weeks to help Thomas and our family through this time".
"We are deeply proud of Thomas for fighting this battle so hard, just as he did in his sporting and everyday life.
"Thomas' heart remained strong throughout the entire journey but he was unable to endure damage to his lungs and other organs.
"We are so proud of our boy for his golden heart, which astounded doctors and all those around him. Thomas' strength will live on as a legacy in our hearts forever. Thank you to those who helped him gain strength to get this far.
"We love you Thomas. Rest in peace our beautiful boy."
Ms Clake said Thomas required numerous blood transfusions to stabilise him during his three-week battle and she was particularly grateful for his friends and schoolmates, who got behind a T for Thomas campaign.
The campaign featured numerous recorded clips of his friends and supporters willing Thomas on with messages of support, creating a T with their arms. It also highlighted the importance of donating blood.
NT Rugby Union chief executive Mark Heath said Thomas' death had shocked the sporting community.
"Thomas was a truly wonderful young man," Mr Heath said.
"He was such a great kid destined for greater things.
"Thomas was a talented sportsman, not only in rugby union, but Aussie rules and others sports as well."
