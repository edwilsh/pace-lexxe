A paparazzo approached Simmons in Beverly Hills to ask if he has any advice in relation to the cancellation, prompting the 67-year-old to suggest Bieber needs to "get a life".
"You don't have anything to worry about, you're rich," Simmons said in a video released by TMZ.
"And in case you didn't notice, you're white. You've got white privilege ... there's nothing to complain about".

"He's young, he's got lots of fans," Simmons said, before attributing the tour cancellation to the "Beverly Hills Blues".
Bieber completed over 150 shows of the Purpose tour, and has assured fans the shows he did play were "unbelievable".
The singer completed the Australian leg of his tour in March this year with fans and critics complaining about his lacklustre performance.
