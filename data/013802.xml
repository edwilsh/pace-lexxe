  <title>Legal battle over Vic abortion safe zone</title>
  <content>
A Victorian pro-life activist is fighting back after being charged with harassing people outside a Melbourne abortion clinic.
Mother-of-13 Kathleen Clubb has been charged with engaging in prohibited behaviour within a safe access zone after she allegedly harassed a couple outside East Melbourne Fertility Control Clinic in August 2016.
The 51-year-old was the first person to be charged under the new law, and is challenging the legislation at the Melbourne Magistrates' Court.
Clubb is due to resume a hearing on Friday along with counsel from the Attorney-General's Office and prosecutors before Magistrate Luisa Bazzani.
Her barrister, Frederick Christopher Brohier, says the legislation is invalid because it impinges on the implied freedom of political expression.
He also says the law is being used against people with pro-life beliefs, and not those on the other side of the debate.
"We say it's discriminatory in its application because it applies to the one side of this issue," he told the court on Thursday.

Safe access zones near Victorian abortion clinics came into effect in May 2016 in accordance with legislation banning protesters from harassing people within 150 metres of such premises.
Under the law, it is an offence to communicate with people entering or leaving in a way that is "reasonably likely to cause distress or anxiety".
