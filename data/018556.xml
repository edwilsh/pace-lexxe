  <title>Little gem has Invincible spirit</title>
  <content>
COREY Brown is adamant Invincible Gem will be a force to be reckoned with in anything she contests this spring after her dominant Missile Stakes victory at Royal Randwick on Saturday.
The champion jockey, "not so fresh'' after walking the Kokoda Trail during the week, was full of praise for the mare as she claimed the scalp of multiple Group 1-winning stablemate Le Romain in the Group 2 1200m feature.
SUNDAY PREVIEW:
The four-year-old was having her first run since a brave second in the Group 1 Randwick Guineas in March but it wasn't that long ago she was tackling midweek races.
Now, she's an emerging star of the turf.
"From where she's come from to today is a big effort and she's one that will measure up in the spring,'' Brown said. "Her record speaks for itself and she has a lot more wins in her.
"Although (Le Romain) was three wide it didn't matter because we went so slow and I was always going to beat him in the run.''
The bottom line on Le Romain is, although beaten, he lost no admirers after sitting wide without cover. Invincible Gem ($6.50) raced inside her stablemate until Brown pulled her across heels on the turn and she showed a dazzling turn of foot to put 1 1/4 lengths on Le Romain ($1.95 fav) with The Monstar ($8.50) a close third.
Brown was snapped up by trainer Kris Lees to ride Invincible Gem in the Missile a few weeks ago and he had no hesitation in committing knowing he had a quick turnaround from completing the Kokoda walk to riding at Randwick.
He said it was an experience like nothing else.
"I underestimated the challenge I was up for let alone what they went through all those years ago,'' Brown said. "I struggled by the third day and I think we all went through stages where if we could have got an Uber up the mountain we would have.
"When you get to the Anzac Memorial that overlooks Kokoda it's a surreal feeling. I loved every minute of it, though it was very hard.''
Lees admits Invincible Gem has surprised him with her fast rise through the grades but had already set a high bar for her spring goal of the Group 2 Golden Pendant (1400m) on September 23.
"It's good to see these fillies come back because you never know how they are going to come back in the spring and she's in terrific order,'' he said. "She's been doing all her work with Le Romain, he's probably worked a little better, but she's a high-quality mare now.''
He was more than pleased with Le Romain's performance given the circumstances at his first run ahead of a long spring campaign.
"He was exposed the whole way, which was a chance of happening,'' Lees said. "He probably ran out of condition in the last 50m, he's in for a good preparation.''

Meanwhile, Group 1 winner Tycoon Tara has been retired after finishing down the track in the Missile.
"She has done a super job," trainer Peter Snowden said. "It all started this time last year (when Tycoon Tara came to our stable) and this was the first race we ran her in and she won, and her form really hasn't wavered since."
Tycoon Tara won more than $1.1 million in prizemoney and claimed the Group 1 Tattersall's Tiara along with five other Group races during her career.
