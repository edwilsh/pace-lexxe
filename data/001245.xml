  <title>Drunk tourists who climbed crane have sobering revelation</title>
  <content>
THE cold light of day has provided a frightening wake up call to two French tourists who drunkenly scaled a crane in Cairns.

Anthony Bonhomme, 22, and Gauthier Sentis, 26, have escaped penalty after being busted climbing the crane at the site of the Cairns Performing Arts Centre after a big night drinking on Friday.

Speaking outside court this morning the pair, who have been in Australia for about five months, said they had returned to the Sheridan St site the morning afterwards and were shocked about how high they had been.

"We could have fallen and been found dead the next morning, it was really dangerous," Bonhomme said.

"I think we not drink as much as Friday night."

The pair faced the Cairns Magistrates Court charged with trespass and unregulated high-risk activity this morning and were released without penalty by Magistrate Suzette Coates.
