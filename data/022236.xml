  <title>Can Judah Kelly save The Voice?</title>
  <content>
THE Voice winner Judah Kelly has given the TV show two years of consecutive Top 5 albums.
Kelly's album Count On Me entered the ARIA chart this week at No.3.
Last year's winner Alfie Arcuri reached No. 5 with his debut album Zenith.
Kelly's No. 3 debut actually topped last week's No. 6 debut of Triple J-approved Voice finalist Vera Blue (aka Celia Pavey).
The Voice's first two winners, Karise Eden and Harrison Craig, both entered at No. 1 with their winners' albums.
Anja Nissen's debut peaked at No. 11 and Ellie Drennan's at No. 14.

Kelly's high debut can be attributed in part to the album being sold for $10 upon release.
Vera Blue also released her new album - her first week sales were slightly more than Kelly's.
The test for Kelly will be keeping his album at the right end of the chart next week.
Album sales have been struggling all year - Kelly sold 2455 copies to reach No.3.
Kelly's future could lie in country music - his album has a country flavour and a country version of his single Count On Me was released by his record label.

The 20-year-old Queenslander will also perform at the Gympie Muster later this month.
His album is No. 1 on this week's ARIA country album chart, as well as the ARIA Australian Artist chart.
However it has dropped to No. 49 on the iTunes chart, suggesting a fall in next week's ARIA chart.
Kelly embarks on an intimate tour in September, playing boutique venues across Australia including Leadbelly in Newtown on September 3, Brass Monkey in Cronulla September 8, Bella Union in Melbourne on September 10 and Old Museum in Brisbane on September 18.
