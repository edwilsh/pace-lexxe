  <title>Sub-zero temperatures in WA's south</title>
  <content>
Perth has shivered through its coldest morning since last August, with temperatures falling below 2C in the city, while sub-zero temperatures were felt across the Wheatbelt.
Bureau of Meteorology data shows the temperature in Perth fell to 1.8C about 7.30am and -0.9C was recorded in Cunderdin just before 5.30am.
After a day of sun and clear skies, rain is predicted to return to WA's south on Thursday and continue to the weekend.
