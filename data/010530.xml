  <title>Beef family in mourning after helicopter crash</title>
  <content>
Air crash investigators have been sent to outback Queensland as a prominent family mourns the loss of a helicopter pilot killed in a mustering accident.
The pilot, Brent Acton, died when his helicopter hit powerlines and crashed to the ground about seven kilometres north-west of Cloncurry in the state's north-west about 7.15am on Wednesday.Photo: Facebook
His Robinson R22 helicopter was destroyed in the fiery crash and emergency services rushed to the scene after another pilot spotted the crash.
The pilot, a member of the prominent Acton beef family, worked for the Cloncurry Mustering Company.
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is investigating what caused the two-seater, single-engine helicopter to crash.
Two investigators, with experience in maintenance and operation, were sent to the site on Wednesday and expected to begin investigations on Thursday.

Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman Peter Gibson said it was believed Mr Acton was travelling to a job, rather than actively mustering, when he hit the power lines.
"It does happen, yes. It doesn't happen often, thankfully," Mr Gibson said.

"Mustering pilots obviously are trained for low-level flying, clearly, that's what they do.
"Part of low-level flying of course is awareness of risks such as powerlines and there is specific training you do to be able to manage those safety risks."
Mr Gibson said thousands of the R22s were in operation and were commonly used for mustering.
Tributes have been posted online as friends mourn Mr Acton's death.
"My thoughts n prayers to the Acton family n friends at this horribly sad time," one friend said.
