  <title>Burst water main in Adelaide street sends debris flying into air</title>
  <content>
A burst water main has caused chaos in Adelaide this morning, sending water and pieces of rubble 10 metres into the air and onto the roof of a house.
Crews were called to contain the "gusher" on Pamela Road in Torrens Park around 1:30am and managed to stop water from flooding nearby homes.
Pamela Road remains closed this morning.
The owner of the house that was struck by water and rubble told 9NEWS he doesn't yet know how much damage has been done to his roof.
SA Water crews have now switched the water supply back on for residents.
They've also filled in the crater caused by burst main. It will be covered in bitumen before the road will be reopened to traffic.
