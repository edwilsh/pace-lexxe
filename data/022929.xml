  <title>Brisbane bus drivers to refuse fares again</title>
  <content>
Bus drivers will again refuse to accept fares from passengers this week as part of an ongoing dispute with Brisbane City Council over pay, safety and rosters.
Rail, Tram and Bus Union spokesman Tom Brown confirmed on Monday its drivers would offer free travel all day on Wednesday and Thursday.
"Our drivers need better protection in the workplace, rosters that don't lead to driver fatigue and safety risks, and fairer pay," it said in a statement.
"We will continue our campaign until a reasonable outcome on these issues is achieved for our members."
It is the fourth week in a row the drivers will take industrial action over pay rates, rostering issues and safety concerns.
Last week drivers walked off the job for four hours on Wednesday and refused to collect fares on Friday.
The warring parties have held several meetings in recent weeks but have failed to negotiate a new enterprise agreement.
