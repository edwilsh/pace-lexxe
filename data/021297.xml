  <title>Christian Bale gets fat for movie</title>
  <content>
HE'S famed for drastically changing his body for acting roles - and Christian Bale is just about unrecognisable as he prepares for his latest acting challenge.
The Batman actor, 43, will soon take on the role of former US vice president Dick Cheney in an upcoming biopic by director Adam McKay. The super-fit star is gaining weight for the role, and looked just about unrecognisable with a new close-cropped haircut as he stepped out in LA this month:
It's unclear what part of Cheney's life the as-yet-untitled biopic will portray. The 76-year-old politician and Bale hardly share much of a natural likeness:

Bale's most famous physical transformation to date came back in 2004, when he played a man with crippling insomnia. Bale dieted for four months prior to filming, losing 28kg and bringing his total body weight down to an emaciated 54kg. After filming finished, the 6ft tall actor then had just six months to bulk up for his role in Batman Begins.
