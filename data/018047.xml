  <title>Goulding has sights fixed on representative future</title>
  <content>
RUGBY SEVENS: Claiming gold in the Youth Commonwealth Games is just the start for Rebecca Goulding, who has her sights fixed on further representative honours.
The 18-year-old is the Sunshine Coast Sports Federation Junior Sports Star of July after helping the Australian rugby sevens side to victory in the Bahamas.
Despite being a relative newcomer to the sport, Goulding proved an instrumental addition to the team, which went through the competition undefeated.
"It was probably one of the best experiences I've had so far in my sporting career," she said.
Goulding is preparing for her next challenge as she joins the University of Queensland in a newly-formed national rugby sevens competition.
The squad is yet to be finalised, but Goulding hoped to make the final cut, to play alongside and against Rio gold medallists.
She said the competition was a "pathway" into the Australian team.
THE Sunshine Coast Council development award winner is soccer player Brodie Boyce, who represented Australia at the ASEAN Football Federation U15 Championship in Thailand.
