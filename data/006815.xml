  <content>
Police are launching a fresh appeal for witnesses in the hunt for a gunman who shot a woman in the chest in Melbourne's north earlier this year.
The 52-year-old woman suffered life threatening injuries when she was shot by an unknown person through the door in Glenroy near midnight on March 2.
Police on Wednesday called for anyone who saw a dark grey 4WD or motorcycle in the area around the time of the shooting to come forward.
