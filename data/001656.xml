  <content>
Veteran football broadcaster Les Murray has died after a long illness. He was 71.

SBS chief executive Michael Ebeid described Murray as a "great Australian" who left a legacy for the country.

Devastated at the news that our dear friend & colleague Les Murray has passed away. A great Australian who really has left a great legacy.

Murray arrived in Australia as a refugee from Hungary in 1957 and developed a passion for football while growing up in Wollongong.
He became a journalist in 1971 and was the "face of soccer" at SBS for decades where he shared his enjoyment of the world game.
His contribution to the sport was remembered by many on social media on Monday.

Impossible to put into words how much Les Murray helped grow & shape football in this country. Spent many, many Sundays watching TWG. RIP.
