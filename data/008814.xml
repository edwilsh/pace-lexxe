Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk had conceded her government's decision to  at the Gold Coast's Spit will open her up to attack from some quarters.

"We've started to see a bit of that," she said.
Ms Palaszczuk pointed to a column written by federal LNP Investment Minister Steve Ciobo, published by News Corp, in which he wrote: "The Palaszczuk announcement with respect to the three-storey limit is sensible and consistent with something I said 15 years ago and still agree with."Photo: ASF Consortia
Ms Palaszczuk said Mr Ciobo claimed credit for her government's decision.
On Tuesday, Opposition Leader Tim Nicholls said the decision to abort the project would send "shock waves through the business community".

"[It sends] a message that you can consult for years in good faith with this government and then at the 11th hour, with an election around the corner, Annastacia Palaszczuk and Labor can pull up stumps," he said.

Later at the Mulgrave Hill State School, Ms Palaszczuk denied she was putting political pragmatism ahead of jobs to win seats.
"We made a decision, there will now be a master plan and of course, that does not stop development in terms of up to three storeys high," she said.
Ms Palaszczuk said her director-general was meeting on Friday with a "key investor", who wanted to talk about a more than $1 billion investment to establish new theme parks on the Gold Coast, which could create "thousands of jobs".
"So there is still keen interest in working with my government and indeed my government is very open to working with business to get jobs in Queensland," she said.
Ms Palaszczuk said expressions of interest were open to investors who wanted the available casino licence on the Gold Coast, but she did not identify which locations would be suitable.
"Well, they'll have to come forward with their ideas and expressions of interest," she said.
Ms Palaszczuk said she would have to get legal advice on whether there was any compensation payment available to ASF.
"But under the process deed, the state has the legal right at any stage to terminate," she said.
Asked if she was expecting legal action from ASF, Ms Palaszczuk said: "That's a matter for them, that's entirely a matter for them, but I know the Minister for State Development [Anthony Lynham] is speaking with them and he will speak with them at length."
Ms Palaszczuk said she was not concerned business investors may perceive Queensland as a sovereign risk as a result of the decision to dump the Spit development.
She did not specify which seats she planning to target on the Gold Coast but she was hoping to get as many Labor members as possible elected.
"I need a working majority and if we're going to get a working majority, I need to pick up seats on the Gold Coast as well, that's the reality," she said.
Ms Palaszczuk said the Spit was iconic not just to the Gold Coast or Queensland, but to the world.
She said people thanked her for the Spit decision at the small business breakfast she hosted on Wednesday morning, and she was listening to the community's views on the development.
Comment has been sought from ASF.
