  <content>
A driver has been arrested in Melbourne after witnesses reported seeing him narrowly miss children walking on a footpath.
The man of no fixed address, believed to be aged in his 40s, was driving on the wrong side of a road and then on a footpath at the Mornington Peninsula on Friday afternoon, police said.
Officers pursued the car along the Eastlink toll road toward Melbourne at speeds reported at 200km/h before they made a dramatic arrest at Huntingdale, with the man taken to hospital suffering minor injuries and three police treated at the scene.
