  <title>Rebab for kids: Children as young as 10 in drug detox</title>
  <content>
CHILDREN as young as 10 will be treated for alcohol and drug addictions under new services that include residential rehabilitation and detox for teens.

Under a $6.49 million scheme NSW Health will partner with non-government organisations to bolster alcohol and drug treatment services for 10-19-year-olds.

Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said children up to 14 with drug and alcohol addictions would undergo "intensive intervention" and family support.

"It's a very vulnerable child that's using drugs at that age," Dr Chant said.

An expert advisory panel will assess the proposals which could include an upgrade of the children's hospitals so they can treat young alcohol and drug addicts.
