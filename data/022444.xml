  <title>[SPOILERS] 9 details you might have missed on the latest 'Game of Thrones' episode</title>

Season 3, Episode 6: 'The Climb'
For most of the earlier seasons, Littlefinger's motivations were mysterious. But he laid out his cards on the third season when he told Varys that creating chaos was his mechanism of ascending the rungs of power in Westeros.

'Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder,' he told Varys. 'Many who try to climb it fail, and never get to try again -- the fall breaks them. And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm, or the gods, or love ... illusions. Only the ladder is real, the climb is all there is.'

If Bran has seen this conversation through his greensight visions, it means he probably knows about everything Littlefinger has done -- including betray his father Ned.
