  <title>Cheers! Big drinkers may live longer</title>

TERRITORIANS over 65 who drink up to three alcoholic drinks a day can look forward to a healthy retirement, according to a 30-year-study.
The findings, from the University of California, show that moderate to heavy drinkers are more likely to live to the age of 85 without dementia or other cognitive impairments than non-drinkers.
The study, which tracked more than 1000 middle class white men and women in California, builds on the recent research linking alcohol intake to longevity.
It was revealed on Thursday that Queen Elizabeth II consumes four alcoholic beverages each day.
However, the researchers warned excessive alcohol intake is known to cause alcohol-related dementia and may have other negative affects.
"This study is unique because we considered men and women's cognitive health at late age and found that alcohol consumption is not only associated with reduced mortality, but with greater chances of remaining cognitively healthy into older age," said co-lead author Dr Linda McEvoy.
Moderate drinking is defined as consuming up to one alcoholic beverage a day for adult women of any age and men aged 65 and older.
For men age over 65, that constitutes drinking up to two drinks a day.
Heavy drinking is defined as drinking up to three alcoholic beverages per day for women of any adult age and for men age 65 and older. For men under 65, that would be four drinks a day.
Drinking more than four drinks a day is classed as excessive.
Co-lead author Erin Richard said: 'This study shows that moderate drinking may be part of a healthy lifestyle to maintain cognitive fitness in ageing. However, it is not a recommendation for everyone to drink.
