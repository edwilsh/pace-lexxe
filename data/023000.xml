  <title>Lowlifes steal dead man's military medals</title>
  <content>
CALLOUS thieves have stolen military service medals and an Order of Australia medal during a house break-in in Adelaide's north.
The medals, along with car keys and jewellery, were taken from a home in Justinian St, Elizabeth Downs sometime between 5.30pm and 8.30pm on Sunday.
Entry was gained via a broken window.
Some of the medals belonged to the victim's father Maxwell Stieger, who served as a medic in the Australian Army in Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam and died in 1987.
Mr Stieger was also awarded the Order of Australia for services during the Vietnam War.
His name and service number appear on the back of the medals.
Medals belonging to the victim's husband were also stolen.
Those medals were awarded in recognition of his service in Bougainville and Afghanistan.
Police ask anyone with information about the break-in or the medals to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or report it online at .
