  <title>ICAC: Three former NSW Labor ministers could face criminal misconduct charges</title>
  <content>
The NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) has found that three former Labor MPs, Eddie Obeid Snr, Tony Kelly, and Joe Tripodi engaged in serious corrupt conduct.

Laurie Brown, chief of staff for Kelly when he was infrastructure minister was also found to have engaged in serious corrupt conduct.

The report recommends the Director of Public Prosecutions investigate charging Obeid Sr, Kelly, Brown and Tripodi with criminal misconduct in public office.

Disgraced ALP powerbroker Obeid was in December last year after being found guilty of misconduct in public office over his family's secret business dealings at Circular Quay.

It's taken three years for the ICAC's Operation Credo investigation into dealings between Australian Water Holdings Pty Ltd and Sydney Water Corporation to be released. The investigation cost former NSW premier Barry O'Farrell his job after he failed to remember being given a bottle of Grange, while federal senator Arthur Sinodinos stepped aside from his ministerial role during the investigation.

The ICAC made no findings against either man.

More to come.
