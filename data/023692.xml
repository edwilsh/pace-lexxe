  <title>Moss' Australian accent still 'woeful' in Top of the Lake sequel</title>
  <content>
American actor Elisabeth Moss is riding a career high in Australia thanks to the arrival of Top of the Lake's highly anticipated second season.

But there's just one thing local fans can't get behind: her accent.
Top of the Lake: China Girl sees Moss reprise her role as Robin Griffin, a New Zealand-born detective living in Sydney.
While the series has dazzled critics, some who attended advanced screenings in Sydney and Melbourne have said Moss's accent is just as bad - and perhaps even worse - than the first season.
In the original Top of the Lake, Detective Griffin is meant to sound as though she's from Sydney. However, Moss frequently threw in a rogue 'r' into her dialogue.
To Australian listeners, she sometimes sounded Canadian or even British.
Moss's second attempt at the Australian accent has seen social media pundits vent their frustrations, with the Golden Globe winner's drawl labelled everything from "weird" to downright "woeful".
However, Melbourne University linguistics professor John Hajek said the Australian accent is harder than most people think.
"For someone from North America, the Australian and New Zealand accent is quite unusual," he said. "It's not like the British accent, which they're more likely to have heard."
The phonetician said it's difficult for people with rhotic (r-heavy) accents to drop the 'r' in words like 'car'.
In addition, Australians have a lot of exposure to American and  Canadian accents from a young age thanks to the popularity of overseas film and television.
"It's almost easy for our actors," Dr Hajek said. "To make it big in Hollywood they have to master a North American accent. The obvious exception to that is Rebel Wilson, who doesn't use an American accent. She often shows more British features."

So lovely to be reunited with Elisabeth Moss's weird Top of the Lake accent??? Martha Shearer (@MarthaPShearer)

BBC2's "Top of the Lake: China Girl" is quality. Now Aussies know how English felt after Dick van Dyke's cockney accent in "Mary Poppins."??? ELLIS CASHMORE (@elliscashmore)

I don't remember Elizabeth Moss having this much trouble keeping in accent in the first series of top of the lake.??? harrison (@harrison__kc)

I love Elisabeth Moss. She's an outstanding actress. That being said, her attempt at an Australian accent is woeful.??? Adele Walsh (@snarkywench)

Top of the Lake: China Girl premiered at the Melbourne International Film Festival last week. The full series will be available on Foxtel from Sunday, August 20.
