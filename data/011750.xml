  <title>Asset freeze is a 'witch hunt', Clive Palmer says as he faces court</title>
  <content>
Clive Palmer says he is tempted to take another punt at Canberra as he fights a government-led "witch hunt" to freeze $200 million of his assets.

In a surprise move on Wednesday, the liquidators lodged an application to stop Mr Palmer offloading his assets during the case to retrieve those funds.
Justice John Bond described the move on Thursday as "impulsive" and noted it would have a significant impact on Mr Palmer and his companies.
However, he rejected Mr Palmer's bid to stop the application altogether after the businessman argued it would be unfair to continue without personally serving documents on his nephew Clive Mensink, who is a defendant.
Mr Mensink, who was director of QN when the company collapsed, left Australia in June 2016 and is now subject of an outstanding arrest warrant.

The court heard Mr Mensink had last been in contact via email with his secretary in February but is assumed to be in contact with his lawyer Sam Iskander.
Mr Palmer said he had actually been giving instructions to Mr Iskander on behalf of Mr Mensink and did not think his nephew knew about the court proceedings.

Justice Bond said it was likely Mr Mensink would make contact with either his lawyer, secretary or Mr Palmer while he was "swanning around the world".
Outside court, Mr Palmer touted his potential to fight for jobs, the economy and injustice.
"This is just the sort of thing that tempts you to go back into politics," Mr Palmer said.
"I'm Clive Palmer, I'm a living national treasure."
Mr Palmer also complained a Queensland newspaper had published a photo of when he was fat and lashed out at Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who he is suing for defamation, for being a bad leader.
"It is clear that the prime minister and his cabinet are pursuing a political witch hunt against me," Mr Palmer had said in a statement earlier on Thursday.
