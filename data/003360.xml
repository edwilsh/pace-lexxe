  <title>'I really, really want a medal,' says fit, fast Pearson</title>

After losing two years to a string of awful injuries, Sally Pearson is back. She is fit, strong and fast and believes that next week she can be back on the podium at the world championships.
"I'm here and I'm healthy, I'm fast, I'm fit and I'm strong ... probably just as strong as I have been when I've been at my best," Pearson said.Photo: AP
What, then, is achievable for her after two wretched years when she admitted she had doubts she might ever be back in this position again to contend with the world's best?
"I would love, deep down, I would love a medal, I really would love a medal, I know you really want me to say gold but that's what I want, I would love a medal and I think that would be a huge success, any colour, that would be a huge success and I would be very, very satisfied with a final place," she said.
In July, Pearson twice ran times that turned her onto the thought she was a contender once more. First, she ran 12.68 seconds in the Monaco Diamond League event, which was not an express time but she knew she did a few things wrong technically that she could fix. So she fixed them.
Then came the race that confirmed she was back to near her best and thus back among the world's best. She ran 12.48s in the London Diamond League, which was her quickest time since she won gold at the Olympics at the same venue. It was even quicker than when she won silver at the world championships in Moscow in 2013.

After two years out of major competition - she shattered her wrist in a fall in Rome, then had serious calf and Achilles problems as well as hamstring tears - Pearson had had doubts that this moment would come again.
Last August, as the Rio Olympics got underway, she made the decision to start coaching herself. She parted with another coach and embarked on a new plan.

At each step on her path back she has tried to tell herself not to expect much and so ease the pressure on herself. 'Hey, you've had two years of injuries, be happy to be out there,' she'd say to herself. But each time she would perform and take the next step.
Now she has got to the world championships in good shape and is fast again, and is wrestling with the idea of what she will accept from herself as a good outcome. She wants to say 'just be competitive' and knows this is the politic thing to say, but she has always hated saying insincere nonsense. But to say more than that means she is coming here to win, which she knows only loads up the expectation.
"Do I choose to be fair on myself and just say, 'Just go out there and enjoy it and have fun' or my other side is going 'You are going out there to win'?" she said.
On the flat, Pearson ran 11.25s on the Gold Coast before she left for London and figures she would be 11.1s shape now in the sprint. So her speed is there.
The effect of the London time was not only for what it did for her self-belief but what it heralded to her rivals who would have been quietly hoping the fiercely competitive world and Olympic champion was gone as a serious threat.
Since Pearson has been out injured, American Kendra Harrison has broken the world record (12.2s) but has never won a major championship. Rio Olympic gold medallist Brianna Rollins, who beat Pearson to gold in Moscow, is now serving a drug ban.
Pearson's long-term rival, American Dawn Harper, has served a three-month ban for a diuretic and will be in London.
"Sometimes sport can be a mind game ... I think maybe some people have seen that and still have it in the back of their minds that I can still be a contender," Pearson said.
"It's just a matter of what tricks does she [Harrison] have up her sleeve as well? What can she pull out and what can I pull out at the last minute? I know that I have a lot more to give. I think I do and I'm capable of doing it; it's just a matter of whether I can deliver it on the day. It will be interesting to see what she can come up with as well."
