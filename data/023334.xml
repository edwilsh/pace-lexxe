SPOILER ALERT: This is a recap. That means we'll be discussing the events of Game of Thrones' fourth episode.
Be warned, this episode was LIT. If you haven't seen it yet and don't want to know what happens, this is your cue to leave before you get well and truly burned.
Otherwise, catch up on everything you missed last week with our , and check back here later for our analysis of the latest episode.

KING'S LANDING
After six seasons of promising one thing and doing another - they are in government, after all - the Lannisters are finally paying their debts. Sherlock Holmes' brother is delighted, and with the Tyrells' gold en route to King's Landing, he is already thinking about the Iron Bank's next promising investment.
In our wondrous modern utopia, that investment would probably go to a , or a new app that puts wacky filters on your dick pics before distributing them to unsuspecting strangers. Bonergram? Pricktionary? Potential investors, please get in touch.
In Westeros, however, the most profitable venture in town is the indiscriminate murder of Cersei's enemies. Try giving that a fun name.

DRAGONSTONE
Like the rest of us, Daenerys has many, many questions about Missandei's sexy times with Grey Worm. How did he manage to, ahem, worm his way into her pants? Why did she leave the door open the whole time so the whole bloody barracks could see them? Unlike Grey Worm himself, Missandei is holding her tongue.

And hey while we're talking about sex, look who's here! Jon Snow, who - and I cannot stress this enough - is probably Daenerys's nephew, is waiting in the background, ready to shoot more smouldering glances her way. You know the spirit of George R.R. Martin lives on in this show when it serves up shameless, gratuitous, incestuous sexual tension and expects you to think it's romantic.

"Hear me out. I think we should rename him Dickon. Think of the irony!" Pic: HBOSource:Foxtel
Jon leads Daenerys into a cave full of what I can only presume is shiny dragonglass - unless you're watching a 70-inch 4k television, it pretty much looks like a black screen. "I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits," Jon says. Ramsey probably told Theon the exact same thing before lopping off his genitals.
As I said, it's too dark to really see anything, but for what it's worth, Daenerys does a good job of pretending to be impressed. "There is something else I want to show you," Jon adds, stepping closer. The tension is palpable. Daenerys prepares to use her pretend "wow I'm so impressed face" again. Then Jon whips out his ... ancient rock drawings.

"I have something else to show you." *unzips pants* Pic: HBOSource:Foxtel
The drawings appear to prove the White Walkers are real. What a happy and convenient coincidence! What we didn't see was Jon furiously drawing them himself moments earlier, signalling for Davos to buy him more time as Daenerys descended the Dragonstone steps.
Utterly convinced by Jon's childlike art, Daenerys promises to help him fight the White Walkers - if he bends the knee. Jon's track record with women in caves suggests he quite enjoys getting on his knees, so that shouldn't be too much of a problem.

"Jon ... why is there a wall painting of us having sex?" Pic: HBOSource:Foxtel
When they exit the cave, Tyrion and Varys are outside waiting to deliver bad news - the Tyrells are dead, and the Lannisters now control most of the food and money in Westeros. As a calm, collected and rational ruler, Daenerys responds to this unfortunate setback by losing her s**t and accusing her most trusted adviser of disloyalty.
Asked for his opinion, Jon tells Daenerys not to turn into a murderous psycho, which is the sort of good, solid life advice all monarchs in Westeros should probably write on their bedroom walls.

"... Starting to think Cersei isn't so crazy after all." Pic: HBOSource:Foxtel
Later, after Daenerys has left the island, Jon and an increasingly sassy Davos discuss his obvious perving.
"She has a good heart," Jon says. "A good heart? I've noticed you staring at her good heart," Davos shoots back, which is admittedly a bit rich, considering how interested he seems to be in both of Missandei's "hearts".
Their incessant boob innuendo is eventually interrupted by the arrival of Westeros's ultimate mood-killer, Theon Greyjoy. He's still alive for some reason.

"What's the point of you? You don't even have boobs." Pic: HBOSource:Foxtel
WINTERFELL
Littlefinger is trying the "I wanted to have sex with your mother so you should definitely trust me" routine on yet another Stark child. He gives Bran a welcome home gift in the form of a distinctive dagger - an assassin once tried to kill Bran with it, setting in motion the chain of events that ended with the gruesome deaths of his parents and two of his brothers. Personally, I would have preferred a fruit basket.
Littlefinger seems to think Bran will be easy to manipulate. Little does he know the young Stark is actually an omniscient tree in human form, though he appears to finally realise something is wrong when Bran repeats his "chaos is a ladder" catchphrase back to him. Somehow it sounds even creepier coming out of Bran's mouth.

"Chaos? What chaos? I don't even like chaos. No one hates chaos more than me." Pic: HBOSource:Foxtel
Visibly disturbed, Littlefinger is only too happy to leave the room when Meera Reed shows up. Remember her? She's the person who dragged Bran north of The Wall and back almost single-handed, somehow keeping him alive against impossible odds and losing her own brother in the process. They share an unbreakable bond of ...
Oh wait, no they don't, because the tree internet turned Bran into an arsehole with no real connection to other human beings. It's a bit like the real internet in that regard.

"Bran, my brother died for you!" *Read, 1:08pm* Pic: HBOSource:Foxtel
Arya shows remarkable restraint by her standards when she refrains from brutally killing a pair of idiotic guards on her way into Winterfell.
Sansa greets her long-lost sister with one of those ominous, foreshadowy-sounding lines Game of Thrones loves so much: "I hope Jon comes back soon. I remember how happy he was to see me. When he sees you, his heart will probably stop." Uh oh.
Come to think of it, did Jon's heart even restart after stopping the first time? The technicalities of being a zombie in Westeros still haven't been explained.
"Arya, Bran's home too," Sansa adds. "But he's a right little prick now."
Bran, who knows Arya's "list of names" is real and not a joke, nevertheless gives her the Valyrian steel knife because apparently he's OK with enabling his sister's murder addiction.

"If this is an intervention, you're doing it wrong." Pic: HBOSource:Foxtel
She uses the knife to show off in a sparring match with Brienne, as Littlefinger watches on and re-evaluates his life choices. He fought all those battles in his mind, and not one of them involved Arya becoming a master assassin with access to the only weapon that could give him a sufficiently ironic death.
Gee, I wonder where this is going.

"And then I'll stick the knife through Littlefinger's throat, like this. Oh, um ... spoilers?" Pic: HBOSource:Foxtel
THE GRASSY BIT BETWEEN HIGHGARDEN AND KING'S LANDING
Bronn is that guy who struts into his performance review and confidently demands a 300 per cent pay rise. In this case, he probably deserves it, considering Jaime did promise him a castle several seasons ago and there's a big, empty one right behind them.
Sadly, Bronn doesn't get his reward. Instead he gets some more unglamorous grunt work, followed by a dose of almost certain death as Daenerys ambushes the Lannister forces aboard Dracarys, with an army of My Little Pony obsessives slaughtering them in her wake.
Dickon is in mortal danger as well. I don't expect you to care; I just wanted to say the name Dickon. Hilarious.

"... I don't get it." Pic: HBOSource:Foxtel
Even after Bronn implies he's a useless cripple who belongs nowhere near the battle, Jaime refuses to flee, instead choosing to gallop around rather aimlessly gawking at the flames with a horrified look on his face.
Meanwhile, Bronn abandons his newly acquired pile of gold to casually shoot down a freaking dragon. Forget Jon, Daenerys, Tyrion, Jaime - all the main characters, in fact. Bronn, you da real MVP.

Bronn is Azor Ahai CONFIRMED. Pic: HBOSource:Foxtel
Jaime finally decides to make himself useful as Daenerys hops off Dracarys and tries to dislodge the arrow lodged in his shoulder. With Tyrion watching in horror, he charges straight at the dragon, and is only saved at the last minute by, you guessed it, MVP Bronn. Tackle of the season right there.
Things have escalated quickly for Jaime. This season started with him getting burned by Euron, and now he's getting burned by a dragon. If he survives any more attempts at immolation we'll have to .

"That would certainly explain my passion for incest." Pic: HBOSource:Foxtel
