  <title>Australian Olympic great Betty Cuthbert dies at age 79</title>
  <content>
Australia's Betty Cuthbert, a four-time Olympic gold medallist sprinter, has died aged 79.

12 MINS AGO  UPDATED 3 MINS AGO

Australian sprinting legend Betty Cuthbert has died age 79.

Cuthbert was a four-time Olympic gold medallist, winning three at the 1956 Melbourne games in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay events.

Cuthbert, who also won gold in the 400m eight years later at the Tokyo Olympics, died overnight after a long battle with multiple sclerosis.

Cuthbert was Australia's first inductee into the IAAF Hall of Fame in the inaugural year in 2012, along with Jesse Owens, Carl Lewis and others.

Her lunge at the line in the 100m at the Melbourne Olympics is captured in bronze outside the Melbourne Cricket Ground, scene of her 1956 track and field glory.

She failed to defend the titles at the 1960 Games in Rome due to injury.

But she returned to the Olympics four years later after a two-year break from the sport, winning a fourth gold medal and becoming the first athlete in the world to do so in four different events.

Cuthbert was born in Sydney in 1938.

Tributes are pouring in for Cuthbert.

Rest in peace Betty Cuthbert, forever a golden girl.
