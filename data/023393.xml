  <title>ACT government needs to come to country party for Canberra Raiders to go bush</title>
  <content>
The ball is in the ACT government's court when it comes to the Canberra Raiders taking games to the bush.

They're contracted to play all their home games there and would cop a "fair whack" if they took a game to Wagga Wagga, making it not financially viable.
The government has waived the fee in the past, which allowed the Raiders to look into taking their home game against the New Zealand Warriors in Wellington.

The NRL is set to take up to five premiership matches to the bush next season in the wake of the City-Country fixture being axed.
Raiders chief executive Don Furner said they were still open to the idea.

"We're one of the ones looking at it ... certainly we consider the Riverina region our region and we'd look to take one there," he said.

"But we'd have to talk to the NRL, we'd have to talk to the ACT government because there's a fee for us to have to take games away from here.
"So we'd have to go through all that and we haven't taken that step yet. We haven't sat down with the footy staff and spoken to them about it, or the board, but certainly we would be considering it."
Raiders great Alan Tongue backed the idea at the NSW government's announcement of $100 million for regional sporting facilities on Monday.
Tongue was recruited to the capital from Tamworth and said the investment will ensure sporting clubs continue to play integral roles in regional communities.
He said sport was an important part of regional communities and could help stop young people from slipping through the cracks.
"I think it's wonderful and it's great to see places like Tamworth and Mudgee being able to host NRL games, whether it be pre-season or competition games," Tongue said.
"It's important we acknowledge the regional supporters and the players we get from those areas, it's a great way of giving back to those communities."
NSW deputy premier John Barilaro said proposals with a minimum project value of $1 million would be considered and suggested Queanbeyan could be awarded funds.
The Raiders' spiritual home Seiffert Oval could be in line for a facelift and Barilaro was hopeful upgrading regional facilities would help make the stars of tomorrow.
"Here in Queanbeyan the council have a concept for out at Jerrabomberra of a regional sports centre, comprising of a number of different sports, hockey and football," Barilaro said.
"Right across regional NSW everywhere I go people are talking sport, there's no question sport is the fabric of our regional communities and we need to support them.
"This isn't just about improving amenities and facilities at a grass roots level, but it's also upgrading facilities to a standard that can attract state and national sporting events in regional NSW.
"You look at our region and we've had some fantastic athletes come out of here in David Campese from Queanbeyan, Laurie Daley from out in the regions and Brad Haddin."
The $100 million comes from the Regional Sports Infrastructure Fund and falls under the $1.3 billion Regional Growth Fund announced in the 2017-18 NSW state budget.
