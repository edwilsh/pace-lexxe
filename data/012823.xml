  <title>Al-Qaeda releases kidnapped S.African man</title>
  <content>
South African man Stephen McGowan, who was kidnapped by al-Qaeda from the Mali tourist town of Timbuktu in 2011, has been released and is back home, Foreign Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane says.
McGowan, who had been touring Mali on motorbikes with a German, a Swede and a Dutch national, was undergoing medical tests but had no major injuries, Nkoana-Mashabane told a news conference on Thursday.
No ransom was paid, she said.
"We would like to warmly welcome him back home and wish him good health, good fortune in his life as a free man. It is with sadness though, that his dear mother... passed on in May 2017 without seeing her son back home," she said.
Swede Johan Gustafsson, who was kidnapped alongside McGowan from a Timbuktu restaurant, was freed in June.
The kidnappers had demanded $US5 million ($A6.3 million) for his release but the government rejected it, Swedish radio reported.
Their German friend was killed in the initial kidnapping, while Sjaak Rijke of the Netherlands was freed in 2015 in a raid by French special forces.
Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb have been responsible for dozens of kidnappings of Westerners and scores of attacks on security forces across West Africa.
