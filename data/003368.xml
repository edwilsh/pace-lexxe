  <title>Fiji women uplifted by bra drive</title>
  <content>
Until recently fitness classes for females run by the Gymnastics Federation of Fiji hadn't been going too well, with women from remote villages reluctant to turn up because, quite literally, of a lack of support.
That was when Australian volunteer Lani Kai Peters stepped in and organised a bra drive back in Brisbane.
Out of that more than 200 bras were donated, and she says the result has been uplifting for the local women, and for class attendance.
