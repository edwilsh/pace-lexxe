"Rental expectation around $280/wk is expected. This is way cheaper than the price of a block of land, and offers the new owner a rental income to cover the utility bills."
Among improvements made by the current owner were fresh carpets and a new kitchen.
Another two bed unit in Zillmere at was priced at $259,900. Agent Matt Phillips of Image Property Aspley did not expect it to remain on market for too long at that price.
He was marketing it as having a large balcony as well as extra storage space and a large lock up garage - "a must see".
