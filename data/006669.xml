  <title>Memories of some great musical times</title>
  <content>
WHAT do I remember of the Sunshine Coast entertainment scene? Well, how did the saying go ... if you could remember the '70s, you weren't there.
So as we moved into the '80s, we had an emerging live music scene ... jazz singer Lyn Gillett at the Smugglers Cove, downstairs in Mooloolaba Esplanade, some great Sunday afternoons at Ronnie Coxhell's upstairs at the Avocado Gardens, I think it was called, in the main street of Buderim.
Some really big bands came through Stewart's at Alexandra Headland ... the Galaxy Room. Midnight Oil would have to have been the stand-out.
Vince Jones would bring his band up for the Jack Newton Celebrity Golf Classic. I got to sit with them one night when it was held at Tewantin-Noosa Golf Club.
Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke was a guest that year.
I also remember Vince in concert at Fraser's Nightclub at Hyatt Coolum. Ronnie Scott's jazz band came out from London and played there as well.
James Morrison has been a regular visitor and I saw Tommy Emmanuel play at the Galaxy and at Nambour Civic Centre.
Yet I first saw him play guitar as a 17-year-old ... he was touring the Northern Territory with Buddy Williams. The concert was in the open at Wave Hill, 500 miles west of Katherine.
Graeme Connors was always a favourite at Nambour yet the one-man show John Williamson put on was spellbinding. There were times you could hear a pin drop in the hall.
That was something I learned while in the Territory. It was during a Slim Dusty concert, again at Wave Hill and Slim's wife Joy McKean told me how the quieter the audience in the bush, the more they liked you, what you were singing about.
It even took them a while to get used to that ... and they toured Australia for so many years.
The early days of the Country Music Muster at Gympie - Gary Shearston, Ted Egan ... great singer-songwriters who captured the spirit of the outback. Sitting with him around the campfire backstage while he told yarns and played the beer carton.
I remember the formative meeting of the Maleny Folk Festival, now the Woodford Folk Festival. It was held in the lounge room of Bill Hauritz's home at Nambour. Those first festivals were held at the Maleny Showgrounds. Some of the acts were Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band featuring Tim Conway, Kev Carmody singing From Little Things Big Things Grow, and , which he wrote with Paul Kelly about the story of Vincent Lingiari who began the Aboriginal land rights movement when the Gurindji people walked off Wave Hill Station in the 1960s and set up their community at Dagu Ragu, Wattie Creek.
Archie Roach with his plaintiff song Took The Children Away.
One of the greatest nights I remember was Mick Conway and brother Jim, who went on to play in the Backsliders, doing a night of song, juggling and fire-eating at the Eumundi Teahouse in the early '80s. Their father Jim Conway was a Noosa Shire councillor, so they would often visit.
We would go out to Eumundi for music at either of the two pubs in town: Joe's Waterhole or the Imperial. We would go to Kin Kin Hotel of a Sunday or to the Verrierdale Hall to hear Barry Charles, Andy Tainsh and their friends play. They were the salad days of Noosa.
Barry and Andy had a lot to do with the creation of live music on the Coast. They drove up from Melbourne in a car and stayed. They formed The Rockets and could be found in a number of Hastings St venues.
Barry was one of the few solo musicians who could stop an audience ... and make them listen, whether it be of a Saturday afternoon in the public bar of the Royal Mail Hotel in Tewantin or of a night at the Villa Noosa Hotel in Noosaville. A great blend of the blues and the laid-back tropical lifestyle.
Harmonica player Doc Span was another performer who brought a Chicago-style blues to the Coast.
Other venues were the Reef Hotel at Noosa Heads, Mariachis Nightclub in the Junction which was to evolve as the Rolling Rock in Hastings St. The bush dances at Yandina, Kin Kin and Cooran halls ... a thoroughly enjoyable night out for the entire family. Just bring a squeeze box, bass and fiddle and a sense of fun.
The surf clubs were also great venues for live music.
We had the Sit-Down Comedy Club at Fridays in Mooloolaba.
Thursday night was blues night at the Woombye Hotel, with some great touring acts. But one of the best was Lil' Fi and the Delta Kings ... was that the name of the band? Blind Dog Donnie, I think, was on guitar.
Home-grown talent? The Outlaws, Hat Fitz and his group. Can't remember their name ... maybe Hatz Fitz and the Hatz Fit.
The Beach Chalet at Sunrise Beach was a great bastion for emerging acts, especially Monday nights with what grew out of hospitality nights at Gastons in Sunshine Beach ... a night where anyone in the hospitality industry would go on their night off.
Noosa Jazz Festival has been a great innovation. We also had Jazz On The Rocks: a free concert each Easter next to the jetty restaurant at Boreen Point. There was even a night with Kenny Ball and the Jazzmen at the Royal Mail Hotel.
Cold Chisel at Surfair. Split Enz, Spy v Spy, John Butler at The Shed at Aussie World. Back in the '80s, we had the Noosa Rock Concerts at the Aussie Rules Ground. I think INXS played there one year ... but then my memory might be deceiving me.
Mojos, the coffee shop across the road from the Galaxy at Alexandra Headland, had all sorts of musicians dropping by late at night.
Then there was the old service station on the corner of Ocean St and Horton Pde and the petrol pump attendant would look in surprise at who they were serving in the CW Kombi or similar can the morning after a big concert.
Seeing John Butler Trio at The Shed at Palmview a few years back with my daughter - a great concert and at the same time you realised it was the start of another chapter in your life. The appreciation of music had been handed down.
I just wish I still had the tickets to that Beatles concert in Melbourne's Festival Hall during the 1960s to hand down to her.
Then there was the time we shook hands with the Big O, Roy Orbison back stage when he was part of a double bill with the Rolling Stones. A memory I can share with her.
The privilege of seeing Pavarotti sing in Brisbane, that was a legacy she will always have.
