  <title>CLP turns to youth to help shattered party rebuild in Northern Territory</title>
  <content>
When Territorians, having had enough of years of dysfunction, handed the Country Liberals Party their worst-ever election defeat in August last year, 30 year-old law student and former Defence Force member Daniel Banks saw opportunity in the chaos and joined the party the following day.
The CLP, which had dominated the NT's political landscape since self-government was attained in 1978, scraped in with just two seats in the 25-seat Legislative Assembly after winning the 2012 election with 16 seats.
"I felt that after 27 years of government, this Territory trusted the CLP, and over four years they managed to lose that," Mr Banks says.
"I thought it was a really good opportunity to rebuild that trust and I wanted to be a part of that."
Mr Banks, who is the president of the CLP's youth wing, says that over the past year the membership of the Young Country Liberals has doubled to 51.
"The youth of the Territory need a voice at the table," he says.
The Country Liberals have been looking to boost youth members as part of their attempts to rebuild from their devastating election loss.
The two surviving members of Parliament are struggling to be heard above a crowd of independents which almost triple their number.
'It won't be easy'

The CLP is trying to rebuild and rebrand itself and regain a foothold in Territory politics.
It won't be easy, says new part director, 28-year-old Brad Vermeer.
"It's a challenge, but the Country Liberals governed the NT for 27 years continuously, and that's a legacy worth protecting, and obviously that's a legacy we need to rebuild," he says.
As part of the attempt to re-establish the once-dominant party's profile, Mr Vermeer and Mr Banks are heading to Katherine, a former CLP stronghold.
But in Katherine, even loyal party supporters Royelene and Darryl Hill were disappointed by .
"It needs to be more about their job and what they're doing for the people and not themselves," Royelene Hill says.

But some in the party still seem to be struggling to digest the strong message delivered by voters last election, and in recent weeks internal divisions have risen to the surface.
One of the party's most high-profile female members, .
Her allegation was followed by an ugly social media row between former and current party members.
The party's former leader, Terry Mills, who is in parliament as an independent, has already written the Country Liberals' obituary.
"I think the prospects for the CLP are in fact quite bleak ... they haven't been able to resolve internal problems," Mr Mills says.
But Country Liberals leader Garry Higgins says a review of the election loss by federal Coalition figures Brian Loughnane and Scott Mitchell will be discussed by the party's Central Council in September and will provide members with a unifying goal.
"They've sort of got to sit back and go, 'well, we lost, and division was something that caused us to lose and we've got to move forward'," Mr Higgins says.
He supports the review's preliminary recommendation the party needs to increase its membership.
'Let's hope it just gets back to the good old Territory'

In Katherine, some of the party's newest youth recruits have come along to a Politics in the Pub event hosted by the Young Country Liberals.
"It suits my ideas within the political structure," new Young Country Liberals member Ryan Martin from Darwin says.
"It's something I'm interested in learning more about and making a difference in the party, and seeing if there are any ideas I can bring forward to make a difference in the community."
But only a few young people turn up to the event.
Long-term party members privately question if the Country Liberals are attracting enough people who will stick around for the long-term and provide the stability the party desperately needs.
Senior party members expect CLP president Shane Stone, a former chief minister who returned last year to help rebuild, will not seek another year in the role.
But Mr Vermeer says he is committed to staying on as director to fight the 2020 NT election.

As well as finding new members, the CLP also needs a defined policy platform.
The guest speaker at Politics in the Pub is the NT's Young Achiever of the Year, Mark Munnich, a community legal educator with the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency.
He is an unexpected choice for a party that has been calling for a youth curfew.
The Hills say the party they joined more than 30 years ago had a clear sales pitch: developing the Territory and resisting southern influence.
"Let's hope it just gets back to the good old Territory it used to be way back in the 70s," Royelene Hill says.
"No!" jokes her husband Darryl.
The Country Liberals will have to decide if the party's best days are behind it or still lie ahead.
