Corriere della Sera reports the alleged captor told the woman she could be freed upon payment of 50,000 euros (about $A74,245).
The report says investigators also are exploring the possibility the woman was abducted so she could be auctioned off online.

The paper says she was released on July 17 because her alleged abductor discovered she had a young child and considered her unsuitable for sex trafficking.

The London Telegraph reported the model was held captive while her kidnappers sought to "auction" her via the internet.
Police said the model was sent by her agent in the UK to Milan for a photo shoot on July 10 and kidnapped by a man who posed as a photographer the following day.
When the model arrived at the fake studio near the city's central railway station a day later, she was anaesthetised with the drug ketamine which was injected into her arm before she was undressed and photographed.
