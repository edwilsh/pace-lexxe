  <title>Indigenous community takes alcohol policy into its own hands, using elders as bouncers at club</title>
  <content>
Fred Ryan isn't a typical bouncer: at 76 years old, he's an amputee and is deaf in one ear.
But he's also one of the most senior and respected elders of the Beswick community, near Katherine, and for four nights a week he's the community social club's sentry.
"The club's been open for a long, long time ... when we're at the gate we give them a breath analysis and if they go over we tell them they've had enough and go home," he said.
"The club's running really well."
He says he is committed to monitoring the club because it's helping to reduce problem drinking in Beswick.
"We've come a long way to get all of these [alcohol] problems fixed," he said.
Beswick leaders are hailing the social club as a success in reducing alcohol-related crime in their community, as well as the broader region.
Not your ordinary pub

The club doesn't run like an ordinary pub: punters are breath-tested before they enter, and if they blow over the 0.05 blood alcohol limit, they're not allowed in.
Only mid-strength drinks are sold and there's a limit of up to six per customer per day.
"If people drink here and cause trouble then they get banned for a couple of months," said Peter Lindsay, a board member with the club.
"The problem that we're always going to face is people going out there and having drinks.

"We're trying to keep them here where it's safe and try and teach them how to drink in moderation."
The club also temporarily bans people convicted of crimes, including domestic violence.
"If they have problems with their wife, we tell them to go home," Mr Ryan said.
He said there's been fewer fights as a result of the club's policy.
"If they drink in the club and they go home and bash up their wife we have to bar them out," he said.
Alcohol is 'a problem everywhere'

In the Northern Territory, Aboriginal people are 10 times more likely to die from an alcohol-attributed cause than the national rate.
The NT Government is reviewing its alcohol bans and restrictions in Aboriginal communities, and a number of submissions have called for more social clubs in Aboriginal communities to reduce alcohol-related harm if residents are supportive of them.

The ABC recently revealed .
"Alcohol is going to be a problem, it's a problem everywhere, it's a problem if you can't control the young ones these days who don't know how to drink in moderation," Mr Lindsay said.
"These kids are going to go out there and waste all of their money on alcohol and then the trouble starts from there."
Beswick is more than 100 kilometres from the regional hub town of Katherine, and Mr Lindsay said a ban on alcohol in the community wouldn't work, so the club was monitoring drinking on home turf.
"The negative part is that they go into town and if they can't get it there they go elsewhere, they go further out," Mr Lindsay said.
"But if you've got a club and manage it properly and get the whole community involved, especially if someone's going to run amok, they can bar them out of here.
"It keeps people from that community in their community."
