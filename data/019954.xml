  <title>Top End trip worth it for NSW trainer</title>
  <content>
IT'S long way back to Warren in country NSW - about an hour west of Dubbo - and the trip back home will be even more pleasurable for trainer Merv Rumble.
His five-year-old gelding Olivares (Stephen Ridler) gave the leaders a massive start before swamping his rivals in the shadows of the post to take out the Sitzler Maiden Plate (1200m) at Fannie Bay on Saturday.
A second, two thirds and a fourth when he made his debut in Darwin 12 months ago sealed his ticket to the Top End for this year's Carnival.
Olivares had four starts back in the NSW bush without breaking his duck and in April he was sent to Alice Springs where Rumble resided many years ago.
A third over 1400m on April 15 followed by a 10th over 1600m on May 1 (Alice Springs Cup) at Pioneer Park saw Olivares head back to Warren.
Recovering from a back injury, Olivares made his comeback at Fannie Bay on July 19 where he finished fifth behind Dick Leech's Cullinan over 1600m.
He was mile back on that particular day and that subsequently ruined his chances.
Olivares ($4.80) wasn't as far back on Saturday despite making a poor start, but he did give the leaders a decent start.
Garry Lefoe Jnr's Baggins (Raymond Vigar), Kevin Lamprecht's Cleese (Felicia Bergstrand) and Neil Dyer's Remodify (Jarrod Todd) streeted clear in the early stages - the pace was frightening.
Baggins ($2.70 fav) and Cleese ($9.50) still held sway at the turn, but Remodify ($3.10) had had enough as the backmarkers started to bridge the gap.
Baggins buckled, but Cleese wouldn't go away before Olivares literally came from the clouds with a withering burst down the outside to seal victory.
Will Savage's $26 outsider Contact Front (Barry Huppatz) from Alice Springs looked for gaps along the rails and made ground quickly.
In the closing stages it looked like Contact Front would get the cash - that's until Olivares arrived on the scene to seal victory by half a length.
Cleese held on for a narrow third from the fast finishing Bush Chook (Paul Shiers), a $16 hope from the Garry Lefoe Jnr stable.
"He has struggled this preparation and the back injury he suffered in Alice Springs didn't help," Rumble said.
"It took a while to get him up and it took a while before he finally delivered.
"Olivares needs to settle because he can really finish strongly, but he was perhaps a little too far back today."
Ridler, who made it five winners for the Cup Carnival, had his doubts that victory was possible on Saturday.
"We were a long way back and it took him a while to get going," he said.
"He does have a powerful finish and that was clearly evident today.
"It was a great win considering he went from 1600m back to 1200m.
"It does take him a while to wind up and Merv should run him over 2000m when he gets back home."
