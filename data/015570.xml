  <title>Dad convicted of taking his son's ADHD drugs</title>
  <content>
A DALBY man pleaded guilty to a string of drug-related offences in the Dalby Magistrates Court on Tuesday, including taking his own son's ADHD medication.

Colin Malcolm Kirstenfeldt pleaded guilty to five charges including possessing dangerous drugs, possessing utensils, and failing to properly dispose of a needle or syringe.

The charges stemmed from a search warrant that was executed by Dalby Police at the man's residence on July 5.

During the search the police found 2.2 grams of cannabis, water pipes, a grinder, plastic bowl, scissors and a bong.

Police also found a syringe that was used to inject methamphetamine.

Arguably the most worrying find during the search warrant was the drug Adderall, used to treat ADHD.

Kirstenfeldt admitted to taking the drug because he wanted to see how it affected his son, who suffered from the condition.

Kirstenfeldt was convicted and fined a total of $1250 for all charges.
