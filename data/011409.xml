  <title>Unions fined over 2011 Queensland strikes</title>
  <content>
Two unions whose officers encouraged hundreds of workers to unlawfully strike for three days on major Queensland government construction projects have been fined a total of $430,000.
The CFMEU was fined $300,000 and the CEPU was ordered to pay a pecuniary penalty of $130,000 over the May 2011 strikes at worksites including the $800 million Lady Cilento Children's Hospital and the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre extension.
The unions had rallied workers to strike against as part of their campaign against sham contracting, but had admitted before Thursday's decision that the actions were unlawful.
