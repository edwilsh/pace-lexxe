A CHEEKY golden retriever has caused its owner all sorts of embarrassment by playing dead and refusing to budge in front of a large crowd on the Gold Coast.
Video shows the disobedient dog refusing to follow his owner while out on a walk.

The dog, clearly not wanting to move, flops onto the ground and won't budge.
For almost a minute, the owner tries to tug the canine along on the lead.
At one point, the visibly frustrated pet owner stretches out the animal's floppy front leg in an attempt to make him move.

The crowd milling around are seen smiling, laughing and pulling out their phones to capture the beachside stand-off.
