  <title>$10,000 for road safety</title>
  <content>
PCYCs, community groups, and school P&Cs can now get up to $10,000 in council funding for local road safety initiatives as part of a new grant from Moreton Bay Regional Council (MBRC).
Mayor Allan Sutherland said applications for council's new road safety grants were open to community organisations to help develop and expand road safety projects.
Councillor (Div 3) Adam Hain said the Caboolture Action for a Multicultural Society (CAMS) was helping police develop a new multilingual road safety book, which would translate local road rules into different languages for adults and seniors from different cultural backgrounds.
"CAMS is one of the many community groups working to deliver road safety initiatives in our area," Cr Hain said.
"From PCYCs to school P&Cs, I encourage all local community groups with an idea or initiative that they believe could help improve road safety on our local roads, to apply for council's road safety grants program before September 29."
