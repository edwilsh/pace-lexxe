Two other people were taken to Royal Melbourne Hospital and one to The Alfred.
All four were in a stable condition.
The collision happened near the intersection with Spencer Street, opposite Southern Cross station on Wednesday afternoon.
An 86 tram rear-ended a 96 tram.

Ambulance Victoria say they assessed about 15 people with six being treated for minor injuries.
Hanqi Liu was on the tram when it crashed and was shocked when a toddler was knocked to the ground.
"Her face bounced into the ground and her nose started bleeding," Ms Liu said.
"The mother said call an ambulance, a lot of people bumped themselves in the face.
"I don't know what happened, it's on a tram, it's supposed to be safe."
The 96 and 86 trams are being diverted, with the section of Bourke Street, between Spencer and King, having been closed by police.
