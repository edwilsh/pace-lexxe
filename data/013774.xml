  <title>Former Ipswich mayor Paul Pisasale hit with two new charges</title>
  <content>
The Crime Corruption Commission (CCC) has charged former Ipswich mayor Paul Pisasale with two counts of attempting to pervert the course of justice. 
The CCC confirmed last night it had served a notice to appear in court to the 65-year-old former Ipswich mayor's legal representative.
The charges follow revelations Sunday that Mr Pisasale's former driver Stephen Potts had told the CCC of having allegedly dropped his client at brothels and illegal massage parlours an average of two to three times a week, while using the mayoral vehicle. 
The latest charges against Mr Pisasale stem from allegations he rang Mr Potts telling him to recant his claims in exchange for a job, .
Mr Pisasale - once the most popular politician in the country - has already been charged with three other offences, including extortion. 

He resigned from his post as mayor of Ispwich on June 6, citing ill health.
His home had been raided by the CCC the day before.
