The one-time world record holder died after a long battle with multiple sclerosis.
Cuthbert was a four-time Olympic gold medallist, winning three at the 1956 Melbourne games in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay events.
Cuthbert, who also won gold in the 400m eight years later at the Tokyo Olympics, was a torch bearer at the opening ceremony for the Sydney Olympic Games.
