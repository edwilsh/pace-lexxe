  <title>Child porn accused to be sentenced in Vic</title>
  <content>
A convicted sex offender who had more than 70,000 child porn pictures and film clips is expected to be sentenced in Melbourne.
Andrew David Henderson, 45, pleaded guilty to possessing, accessing and promoting his collection of child sex abuse images.
Henderson also admitted to unlawfully joining a church as a volunteer.
Authorities found 73,755 child sex abuse images and video files on devices seized from his home in late 2015.
In June 2016, while he was on bail for the child pornography charges, he used a phone with access to the internet, breaching his bail conditions.
He had also joined the iHeart Church near Queen Victoria Market as a volunteer, in another breach of his conditions.
Henderson is due to be sentenced in the Victorian County Court on Thursday.
