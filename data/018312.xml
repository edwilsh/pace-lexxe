The new drawings popped up on the edge of Bethlehem, the Palestinian city where the barrier largely consists of a wall of towering slabs of concrete.
In one scene, Mr Trump is shown hugging and kissing a real Israeli army watchtower built into the wall, as his left arm reaches around the tower - and little pink hearts flutter from Mr Trump's mouth.

Several US-led Israeli-Palestinian attempts to negotiate the terms of a Palestinian state on these lands have failed.
Mr Trump said early on in his term that he would try to broker a deal, but has not offered a way forward.
