  <title>One dead, one critical in separate crashes</title>
  <content>
THE Forensic Crash Unit is investigating a fatal crash on the Sunshine Coast.

Just before 10am yesterday a motorcycle was travelling east on Peachester Road,  reports.

A four wheel drive travelling in the opposite direction was turning right onto Storrs Road when the two vehicles collided, killing the 61-year-old male motorcyclist.

The driver of the four wheel drive was not physically injured during the crash.

Police are now appealing for any witnesses or people who may have seen the red bike travelling on Peachester Rd prior to this incident to contact them.

Further north, a man is in a critical condition after a serious crash at Emu Park, south of Yeppoon.

Emergency services were called to the incident on Pattison St about 6.20am after a vehicle collided with a tree.

Paramedics have confirmed one man was in a critical condition, but was yet to be taken to hospital.

A woman was also inside the vehicle at the time of the crash.

The Forensic Crash Unit is expected to investigate the crash.
