Is this the ultimate survivor mistake?

QUEENSLAND lime farmer Mark oeTarzan" Herlaar, has become a fan favourite on Australian Survivor for one reason " his honesty.

Herlaar, 52, who lives just outside Toowoomba said he could never be different to what he is like in everyday life, and that is a good, honest person.

"What I wanted to do is show people who I was," he said.

"I didn't go in there to try and be someone else.

"I just thought, be yourself, just has I was on my audition tape, and that's what I did.

"I was really happy with it.

"I could happy I could be in an environment where I could be me."

Herlaar, who has two children and is a grandfather, said being on Australian Survivor was only a positive experience, despite all the back stabbing and blind sides, which has happened from the beginning of this series.

"It has been a dream come true," he said.

"I had a blast."

Herlaar revealed that he got the name Tarzan on the very first day of Australian Survivor filming in Samoa.

"There was a bit of banter between the whole tribe, and young Pete looks over at me and says straight up, he looks like Tarzan," he said.

"It just stuck.

"Jonathan asked if I minded being called that and I didn't, because there was another Mark.

"It felt like an honour, going into the jungle and being called Tarzan to be honest."

Australian Survivor is on Sunday and Monday on Channel 10 at 7.30pm.
