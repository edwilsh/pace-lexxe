  <title>Flames tear 'through the roof' at Melbourne factory</title>
  <content>
A cabinet-making business in Moorabbin in Melbourne's south-east has been engulfed by flames overnight.
About 30 firefighters smashed their way into the Nelson Street factory just after 9.30pm after a number of calls from the public to 000.
"The fire was quickly growing at the front, it was through the roof at the stage [when firefighters arrived]," Metropolitan Fire Brigade Commander Ron Young told the TODAY Show.
"It took about 45 minutes to bring under control."
The exact cause of the ferocious blaze is still under investigation and is unclear whether it is suspicious.
No injuries were reported.
A community smoke warning was issued for the area to the west of Chesterville Road, with residents told to avoid the area. Nelson Street was also closed off overnight.
