  <title>SA man jailed over ill-treating dog</title>
  <content>
A South Australian man has been jailed for a month after whipping a neighbour's dog and feeding her sausages filled with lead filings and glass.
Peter Kelliher appeared in Mt Barker Magistrates Court on Friday where he was given a three-month sentence, with one month to be served immediately and two months suspended, the RSPCA says.
Kelliher had pleaded guilty to two counts of ill-treating an animal, one count of causing serious harm and 12 attempted ill-treatment charges for hitting the dog and for leaving sausages filled with lead filings and glass in his neighbour's yard for their dog Mia to eat.
