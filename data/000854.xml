  <title>Late night TV writers are 'bored' by Donald Trump</title>
  <content>
Staff writers on satirical TV programs including The Daily Show and Full Frontal with Samantha Bee have lashed out at the effect Trump's administration has had on their job satisfaction.
"For people in our job, it can get really boring," Daily Show writer Hallie Haglund explained during a Television Critics Press Association panel over the weekend, the Hollywood Reporter.

Late-night hosts go off on Trump's transgender military ban

President Donald Trump kicked off his Wednesday by tweeting his intention to ban transgender people from serving in the military - about 15 hours later, the late-night hosts had thoughts.

"During Obama, we'd have a week where we didn't use a clip of the president. We'd be talking about what else was going on in the world.
"We recently had an act where we did not say Trump's name once. I cannot remember the last time that happened. It's as frustrating as it is boring," she said.  Photo: CBS
Fellow writer Ashley Nicole Black, who works on Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, lamented the fact such satire rarely reached beyond an already agreeable audience.  
"People only watch certain outlets and watch certain commercials," she said.

"We're not going to advertise for Full Frontal on Fox News. The real problem with our country now is that our media diets are so bifurcated."

Stephen Colbert, who took over David Letterman's slot with CBS's The Late Show in 2015, saw his ratings spike just after Trump's inauguration.
The show's focus on Trump takedowns - which  - have kept it in front of perennial slot-leader The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon ever since.  
On Friday, Colbert announced he'd created a new animated show that pokes fun at Trump set to premiere on Showtime later this year.
