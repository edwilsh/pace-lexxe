  <title>Killer SA driver admits he must be jailed</title>
  <content>
A drugged and disqualified driver who was speeding when he ran down a man in Adelaide has apologised for his actions and admits he must go to jail.
Dylan Michael Lanc-Quin read his apology to the District Court on Monday, telling the relatives of his victim there was no excuse for his actions.
Lanc-Quin pleaded guilty to causing the death of Harley Chester in February last year and to fleeing the scene.
