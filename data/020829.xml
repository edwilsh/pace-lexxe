  <title>All Blacks bugging charge case in court</title>
  <content>
An All Blacks security guard is expected to appear in court on Monday accused of making up claims he found a bugging device in the New Zealand rugby team's Sydney hotel last year.
Adrian Gard has pleaded not guilty to one count of making a false representation resulting in a police investigation.
Police alleged Gard lied to officers when he said he found the illegal bug "secreted in a chair situated in the All Blacks' meeting room" at the InterContinental in Double Bay in August.
Gard's case is listed to be heard as a special fixture before a magistrate at the Downing Centre Local Court.
Gard has more than 30 years' experience in the security industry and has worked for leading public figures including former US President Bill Clinton, Oprah Winfrey and golfer Tiger Woods.
He's been involved with the All Blacks' security for 10 years.
