  <title>Walking Dead stars to tour Australia for zombie fest</title>
  <content>
Walking Dead fave Daryl (Norman Reedus, left) will be a guest at the first local Walker Stalker convention.

Fans of The Walking Dead, start practising your lurch.
Stars of the hit TV series will be visiting Australia for the first ever local leg of Walker Stalker, the world's biggest zombie convention.
Cast members Norman Reedus (Daryl), Michael Cudlitz (Abraham), Alanna Masterton (Tara), Ross Marquand (Aaron) and Katelyn Nacon (Enid) are the first big names announced as part of the popular fan festival, landing in Sydney and Melbourne in February 2018.
Walker Stalker - a zombie, horror and sci-fi convention - originally launched in the US in 2013; it now draws over 200,000 fans annually. 
The festival, which in recent years has expanded to the UK and Germany, will include Q&A panels with the show's stars, as well as a themed compound set up by the show's local network, FX.
Fans will also get the chance to live out their own Rick fantasies (and/or avoid the bloody fate of forever favourite Glenn) and outrun zombies in an escape room scenario.
he Walking Dead, the eighth season of which is set to premiere in October, remains the most watched show on television, with over 17 million US viewers tuning into last season's controversial opener.
The series was forced to temporarily halt production last month following the on-set death of stuntman John Bernecker.
"It was a freak accident that happened on set and it's something that we're still dealing with, but it hasn't affected [season eight] storylines in any way," creator Robert Kirkman said at a TCA panel discussion on Saturday.  
Walker Stalker takes place at the Sydney Showgrounds on February 3 and 4, and Melbourne Showgrounds on February 10 and 11, with tickets on sale from August 10.
