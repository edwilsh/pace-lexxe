  <title>Pair argued about meth before death: court</title>
  <content>
A Perth couple argued about the quality of methamphetamine they had taken before the woman was found dead with ligature marks around her neck, a court has heard.
Damien Couzens is on trial in the Supreme Court of WA, charged with murdering his on-and-off partner of 10 years Jody Websdale at her Midland unit in March last year.
Before she was found unresponsive in the courtyard, she had taken meth and other drugs, while he had shot up meth and drunk alcohol, the court heard during opening submissions on Wednesday.
