  <title>Could Taberner be the next Liam Jones?</title>
  <content>
THE West Australian's chief football writer Mark Duffield has a radical solution to Fremantle's ruck situation.
With Aaron Sandilands out for the season and youngster Sean Darcy in need of a rest, Duffield has got a left-field replacement in mind.
Matt Taberner has been carving it up in the WAFL as a forward, but hasn't been able to force his way back into the senior side.
The 199cm talent has done some pinch-hitting in the ruck, with 78 hit-outs to his name this season to go with 33 majors.
"I'd be tempted to play Matt Taberner as the ruckman," Duffield told The Wash Up podcast.
"I tend to think that Jon Griffin will probably still be at Fremantle next year... but throw in Matt Taberner and say 'you're going to be the number one ruckman this week, Sunshine'."

Duffield likened the potential move to swingman Liam Jones' career-saving switch down back for Carlton this season.
Jones has played eight consecutive matches since his return to AFL ranks as a defender in the "great list exploration exercise" of 2017.
"He was a few weeks away from the football scrapheap and someone thought 'let's see how he goes down the other end'," Duffield said.
