  <title>Malcolm Turnbull calls emergency Liberal Party meeting to debate same-sex marriage</title>
  <content>
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has called an emergency meeting of the Liberal Party to debate same-sex marriage, as the government grapples with options including a legally dubious postal vote "plebiscite".
Liberal MPs have been summoned to Canberra on Monday afternoon for the special meeting, with a group of moderates expected to push for the party to dump the plebiscite policy altogether and adopt a free vote.

It's a delaying tactic: Shorten

As talk turns to whether the government will hold a postal plebiscite on same sex marriage, Bill Shorten says the PM is only considering it because of the "right wing dinosaurs" of the Liberal Party.

Fairfax Media understands Mr Turnbull will take a "hands-off" position in the meeting, neither advocating a change of policy or the status quo, and will conduct a ballot if necessary.
The decision to debate the issue in the Liberal Party room, rather than in a joint meeting with Nationals MPs who are more conservative, will anger the junior Coalition partner and Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, who wanted a combined party discussion.

MPs will also discuss the option of a voluntary postal vote on same-sex marriage, as opposed to the compulsory plebiscite, which was rejected by the Senate.
While some MPs including Immigration Minister Peter Dutton have argued a postal vote could be commissioned without legislation, financial and legal experts have now warned that is unlikely.

A leading authority on the federal budget, former deputy finance secretary Stephen Bartos, joined constitutional experts who have suggested the Turnbull government would almost certainly face a challenge in the courts if it commissioned a voluntary postal vote without legislation.

Mr Bartos pointed to section 83 of the constitution, which prevents the government spending money unless appropriated by a law. The High Court examined the section in a 2014 challenge to the school chaplains program by father Ron Williams, ruling the Commonwealth could not rely on its executive powers to fund the program if it were possible to appropriate it separately.Photo: Richard Wainwright
"In other words, it couldn't just assume that it could spend [the money]," Mr Bartos said.
While there were other ways the government could seek to fund a $40 million postal vote, these were legally murky. One potential option would be through existing appropriations under which departments perform market research. The postal vote "could be dolled up as market research on views about same-sex marriage", Mr Bartos said, but "it's probably borderline".
"It would almost certainly be challenged under the same principles as the Williams case," he said. "It's conceivable, but it's a grey area."
Mr Bartos said the budget's contingency reserve could not be used for measures such as a postal plebiscite. The government may seek to use the little-known and rarely-used "Advance to the Finance Minister", Mr Bartos said, but this would be "really out in terms of the rules".
"That's for urgent and unforeseen events, and it would be incredibly doubtful that you could argue that a postal plebiscite was urgent and unforeseen," he said. 
The AFM was last used in 2015-16 when the Australian Electoral Commission asked for $101 million to implement Senate voting reforms. It was not used in the preceding two years, nor in 2016-17.
Constitutional expert George Williams has also warned a postal vote "could explode in the government's face" if not underpinned by legislation. Trying to fund it through a grant to the AEC was "a fraught course of action because that mechanism is not built for a plebiscite of this kind," he said.
