  <title>Cricket pay deal: Here's what you need to know</title>

It's been the biggest pay dispute cricket has seen in decades.
But today, Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA) have called a truce.
Here's what you need to know about their memorandum of understanding.

Key point: cricket deal

It includes a five-year renewed memorandum of understanding worth about $500 million
It's one agreement for all male and female players
It's a revenue-sharing model which includes men, women, playing both international and domestic cricket

What are the key components of the deal?

It's an updated revenue-sharing model.
The previous memorandum of understanding ended on July 1, which left 230 of the 300 players both out of contract and without pay.
Now, players will get to share up to 30 per cent of agreed revenue, which is made up of 27.5 per cent of forecast revenue streams and a 2.5 per cent performance pool.
Previously male players had been sharing in up to 26 per cent of Australian Cricket Revenue, which represents about 80 per cent of Cricket Australia's total revenue.
It will see a male international cricketer's base salary increase from $270,000 to $278,100 in the first year.
That will rise by 15.9 per cent in the last year of the agreement in 2021-2022 to $313,004.
The whole deal is worth about $500 million over the next five years.
It's good news for women's sport

The deal is going to see the biggest pay rise in the history of women's sport in Australia, according to ACA chief Alistair Nicholson.
Female player payments will increase from $7.5 million to $55.2 million.
For international women's cricketers that will see the base rate go from $40,000 to $72,076 in the first year.
That's a whopping 80.2 per cent increase.
That will go up again 119 per cent in its final year to $87,609.
It's also good news for grassroots cricket

Cricket Australia had argued it wanted to change the revenue system so it could give more money to grassroots cricket - something it said was "sorely" needed.
And it's been a big winner in the deal, set to receive a $25 million boost.
Players still have to vote on it

ACA chief Alistair Nicholson said it was now in the player's hands.
"Players will now consider this recommendation into this agreement and we recommend that it will be supported," he said.
"We will conduct a player vote in the next 24 hours to follow past precedent, but we expect that to come back positive."
And they will receive back pay once the deal is signed.
What did Cricket Australia say?

Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland said relationships within the game have been tested and it had been a "turn-off for fans".
"Change ... is never easy but sometimes it's necessary and, as custodian of the game, Cricket Australia is responsible to seek change wherever it's needed rather than just putting issues into the too hard basket," he told a press conference this afternoon.
"This process hasn't been easy and history will judge whether it was all worth it in the end.
"... Neither side has got everything we wanted out of these negotiations but they shouldn't be approached with a winner-takes-all mindset.
"Enduring outcomes depend on the needs of both parties being recognised in the negotiations and in the outcome.
"And in that spirit I think we have reached a good compromise, one we can both live with and one that will be good for the game and good for Australia's cricketers."
What did the Cricketers' Association say?

Mr Nicholson said it was going to take time to heal the strained relations.
"But that's something we'll now work through together for the good of the game," he said.
