EXACTLY 32 years after he first signed up, Inspector Bruce McGregor will join hundreds of other police officers in a reflective mood this morning.
The Lake Macquarie duty officer has had several mates never return home from work, and will help  honour them with the second ''Wall to Wall'' ride of remembrance from the police wall of remembrance at The Domain to the national police memorial in Canberra.
Among the hundreds of motorcycling cops in the convoy will be five of Australia's state commissioners, including NSW's top cop Andrew Scipione.
Inspector McGregor met up with more than 30 of his Queensland counterparts at Heatherbrae yesterday.
In his thoughts will be several old mates, including his former boss, Senior Sergeant Ray Cook, who was killed when he was hit by a lump of firewood as he rode his police bike up the F3 Freeway at Calga in 1998.
The Queenslanders are honouring Senior Constable Damian Leeding and Sergeant Dan Stiller.
