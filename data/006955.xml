Police are looking for a man following a police pursuit in Windale on Tuesday, which ended when the driver fled the scene.
About 8.20pm officers were patrolling South Street when they tried to pull over a Toyota utility to breath-test the driver.

At the intersection of James and Munro Streets, the male driver got out of the car and fled on foot.
