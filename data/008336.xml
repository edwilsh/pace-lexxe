Education Week celebrations at Warrawong Intensive English Centre

The ''tight knit family'' that makes up the Warrawong Intensive English Centre (WIEC) took the time on Wednesday to celebrate past achievements and set future goals.
And as in previous years, the 38th annual WIEC Open Day and Graduation Ceremony was held to coincide with Education Week.
Located in Warrawong High School, WIEC is the only Intensive English Centre outside the Sydney Metropolitan area.
Head teacher Ruth Cooke said past and present students were on hand to see 90 students receive their graduation certificates.

''Our students reflect the multicultural school that is Warrawong,'' she said.

''We have refugees from such places as Syria, Iraq, Burma, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo. We also have non-refugee students from Thailand and Vietnam.
''The one thing that unites all is their desire to learn English. Here is the first place they come for school. They feel welcome as there is other students in the same situation as them.
''It really is like a little family. We enjoy seeing the students learn English and gain some confidence in their own abilities.''
Mrs Cooke said while many WIEC students are refugees, there are also quite a few newly-arrived migrants and international students.
''Our students come from a range of cultural and language backgrounds and many form friendships that last beyond their time with us,'' she said.
Mrs Cooke added many former students, such as Opera singer Ayse Goknur Shanal, have gone on to bigger and better things in life.

Goknur Shanal sang Amazing Grace during Wednesday's event.

''She was fantastic,'' Mrs Cooke said.

''Xinghan Feng, another of our former students, who plays the clarinet, also entertained our students.''
