A SECOND man armed with scissors at Sydney's Central train station has been arrested a week after police shot dead an ice addict who attacked a railway florist with scissors and a broken bottle.
NSW Police confirmed that at 8.30am on Wednesday a man armed with a pair of scissors entered a shop at Central.
The shop was located in the Henry Deane Plaza at the Broadway end of the Central Station tunnel.
After the man entered the shop allegedly armed with the scissors he closed the shop door, NSW Police Media told news.com.au.
A staff member managed to contact police and officers attended the shop where the man was arrested without incident.
Police officers descended on Central station a week after the fatal incident on Wednesday evening of last week.

Florist Emmanuel Theoharis, whose shop is located on Eddy Avenue, was attacked by a man wielding up to four pairs of scissors and a broken bottle.
Danukul Mokmool entered Mr Theoharis's shop at 6.20pm and put his arm around the elderly shop owner's throat, saying "don't move, call the police".
Mokmool, who had two pairs of scissors in his belt and two in his hand pushed the broken bottle into Mr Theoharis's throat, inflicting a 5cm-long wound.

Alerted to an armed robbery in progress, police arrived on the scene and confronted Mokmool.

Officers told the assailant to put down his weapon and when Mokmool refused, they shot him dead.
Graphic video posted on social media filmed by an eyewitness shows two police officers with their guns drawn and aimed at a man inside a florist before someone yells "down".
The man appears to run from the florist towards police before four shots are fired at him.
"F***, f***," an onlooker can be heard screaming.
The man can then be seen lying lifeless on the ground as police come to his aid.
"Everybody move away," someone can be heard saying before the video ends.
Following the latest incident, a man was taken to Day Street police station on Wednesday for questioning.
