  <title>NSW teen charged over police pursuit</title>
  <content>
A teenager has been charged after a police pursuit in Sydney's west.
Officers had noticed a Subaru parked on the wrong side of the road in Fairfield about 1.30pm on Saturday but when they approached it, the car accelerated away.
Police pursued the car down a number of streets before it crossed to the wrong side of the road and crashed into another vehicle before speeding away again.
However, when the Subaru again crossed to the wrong side of the road, the officers ended the pursuit.
The Subaru was spotted a short time later by a police patrol and four males were arrested.
The 17-year-old driver faces a number of charges including reckless driving and was refused bail to appear in a children's court on Sunday.
