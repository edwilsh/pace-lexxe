The Brogan St home, which sits on a 1210sq m block, sold for $730,000.

A FANNIE BAY home has sold at 10 per cent over its reserve price according to One Real Estate selling agent Karl Secondis.
The four-bedroom, one-bathroom elevated home on Brogan St sits on a substantial 1210sq m block that's residential zoned.
The property was only on the market for four weeks before it sold at auction and Mr Secondis said the interest was strong considering the current state of the property market. He said the property sold for $730,000 after bidding started at $600,000.
"We had about 30 people attend with six to eight buyers keen on the property and one man bidding over the phone," Mr Secondis said. "I think the competitive interest allowed the property to sell at a price that was at the higher end of where I thought it would go."
The owners plan to rent the home.
