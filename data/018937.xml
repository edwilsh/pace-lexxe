  <title>Every EPL club's transfer business rated</title>
  <content>
IT has been another busy off-season for Premier league clubs with a total outlay on new players already beyond $1.5bn - with almost a month left before the window slams shut.
Below we review who has spent wisely and who still has business to do.
Arsenal

IN:
Sead Kolasinac (Schalke 04 - released), Alexandre Lacazette (Lyon - $75m)
OUT:
Wojciech Szczesny (Juventus - $16.5m), Kaylen Hinds (Wolfsburg - $3.3m), Marc Bola (Bristol Rovers - loan), Chris Willock (Benfica - undisclosed), Takuma Asano (Stutgart - loan), Dan Crowley (Willem II - undisclosed), (Emiliano Martinez - Getafe - loan), Stefan O'Connor (released), Glen Kamara (released)
THE perennial calls for Arsene Wenger to spend big to freshen up the squad have only partially been met by a record outlay on Alexandre Lacazette. The Frenchman brings quality and the promise of goals, but the side needs more impetus and presence in central midfield as a priority.
Sead Kolasnic is a tough operator and an upgrade on Kieran Gibbs at left back. Should Thomas Lemar - an attacking midfielder of great promise - arrive from what's left of Monaco's Champions League semi-finalist squad, that would constitute par trading or better for a side hampered in the market not just by Wenger's cautiousness but also a lack of Champions League football to offer. Resisting approaches for Alexis Sanchez, even if at the cost of losing him for nothing next summer, may prove Arsenal's best bit of business this summer.
BUSINESS RATING: 6/10
Bournemouth

IN:
Asmir Begovic (Chelsea - $16.5m), Jermain Defoe (Sunderland - free), Connor Mahoney (Blackburn - free), Nathan Ake (Chelsea - $33m)
OUT:
Mark Travers (Weymouth - loan), Ryan Allsop (Blackpool - loan), Lewis Grabban (Sunderland - loan), Sam Sturridge (Yeovil Town - loan), Ben Whitfield (Port Vale - loan)
A BLEND of shopping for the here and now and looking to the future continues to burnish Bournemouth's standing as an established Premier League club, as they continue to prove small teams with good management and ambition can play their way up the ladder. Asmir Begovic is too good a goalkeeper to be sat on Chelsea's bench and will improve Eddie Howe's side, while Jermain Defoe proved last season that age has not yet diminished his eye for goal. His partnership with Joshua King is an exciting prospect or Cherries fans.
In Nathan Ake the South Coast club know what they are getting - a classy, ball playing defender with his best years ahead of him - after a successful loan spell last term. Connor Mahoney is an England age group representative who will spend at least a season with the Under-23s but has an air of expectation around him. After breaking the top 10 last season, Bournemouth looked well placed to stay there.
BUSINESS RATING: 8/10
Brighton

IN:
Matthew Ryan (Valencia - $8.7m), Pascal Gross (Ingolstadt - $4.3m), Josh Kerr (Celtic - undisclosed), Mathias Normann (Bobo-Glimt - $2.1m), Izzy Brown (Chelsea - loan), Steven Alzate (Leyton Orient - undisclosed)
OUT:
Elvis Manu (released), Rob Hunt (Oldham Athletic - undisclosed), Christian Walton (Wigan - loan), Jordan Maguire-Drew (Lincoln City - loan), Oliver Norwood (Fulham - loan), Tyler Forbes (Accrington - loan), Tom Dallison (Accrington - loan)
WHILE Matthew Ryan is mature beyond his years, having played in Spain and Belgium as well as at the World Cup for Australia, he, like the rest of Brighton's new recruits have a conspicuous absence of Premier League experience, something that the club probably need in their debut season at this level. Pascal Gross is a tidy midfielder and Izzy Brown is talented if not yet the finished attacking article.
The team that won promotion has been together for several seasons knocking on the door and that may be a strength, but nothing in their summer business suggests anything other than a fight for 17th is on the cards.
BUSINESS RATING: 3/10
Burnley

IN:
Jack Cork (Swansea - $13m), Jonathan Walters (Stoke City - $4.9m), Charlie Taylor (Leeds United - undisclosed), Phil Bardsley (Stoke City - $3.3m)
OUT:
Michael Keane (Everton - $41m), Tendayi Darikwa ($1.6m - Nottingham Forest), Chris Long (Northampton Town - loan), Alex Whitmore (Bury - loan), Joey Barton (released), Michael Knightly (released), Christian Hill (released), Taofiq Olmowewe (released), George Boyd (released), Paul Robinson (released), George Green (released)
AFTER last summer's big transfer punt - the big money signing of Belgian international Steven Defour - didn't pay instant dividends, Sean Dyche has gone back-to-basics this year. Jack Cork knows the Burnley way having spent two spells on loan at Turf Moor, while Jonathan Walters and Phil Bardsley will bring honest toil to a side that has long made a virtue of just that.
Charlie Taylor will provide some much needed energy and pace from fullback but everything this off-season suggests the approach of being first and foremost hard to beat will not be deviated from. After winning plaudits for a fearsome home record, Burnley nonetheless flirted with relegation, and the loss of the imperious Michael Keane from an overworked defence, despite the value of the sale, may leave them vulnerable.
TRANSFER RATING: 4/10
Chelsea

IN:
Alvaro Morata (Real Madrid - $95m), Tiemoue Bakayoko (Monaco - $65m), Antonio Rudiger ($47.5m), Willy Caballero (Manchester City - free), Ethan Ampadu (Exeter City - free)
OUT:
Nemanja Matic (Manchester United - $66m), Nathan Ake (Bournemouth - $33m), Juan Cuadrado (Juventus - $28.5m), Asmir Begovic (Bournemouth - $16.5m), John Kerry (Aston Villa - released), Christian Atsu (Newcastle United - $10m), Bertrand Traore (Lyon - $14.5m), Nathaniel Chalobah (Watford - $8.2m), Ruben Loftus-Cheek (Crystal Palace - loan), Kurt Zouma (Stoke City - loan), Izzy Brown (Brighton - loan), Michael Hector (Hull City - loan), Victorien Angban (Waasland-Beveren - loan), Mario Pasalic (Spartak Moscow - loan)
ONE of Sir Alex Ferguson's mantras was that great teams must improve from positions of strength. Antonio Conte is aware of this and has lobbied for funds, yet so far $200m (most of which has been recouped in sales) has been spent only on bolstering positions where others have left. All three are arguably upgrades, however: Alvaro Morata has more guile and intelligence than Diego Costa; Tiemoue Bakayoko has a better engine than the ageing Nemanja Matic (and was a vital cog in the purring machine that was Monaco last season with big match experience beyond his 22 years); Antonio Rudiger is more highly rated than the departing centre-back Nathan Ake.
The balance of the reigning champions' squad is intact and winning is a habit. However, standing still is going backwards at this level and you fancy a couple more fresh faces at least - another striker and cover at wing back as a priority - will be needed to maintain their supremacy in the face of rejuvenated challenges to their crown, especially, from the two Manchester sides.
BUSINESS RATING: 6/10
Crystal Palace

IN:
Jairo Riedewald (Ajax - $13m), Ruben Loftus-Cheek (Chelsea - loan)
OUT:
Steve Mandanda (Marseille - $3m), Fraizer Campbell (released), Luke Croll (released), Zeki Fryers (released)
PALACE will be hoping that their best piece of recruitment has come in the form of the manager. Frank de Boer brings a wealth of top level playing and coaching experience and a contacts book fit to bursting. That has yet to result in a major influx of players - save for Jairo Riedewald, a 20-year-old ball playing defender whom de Boer gave his debut at Ajax as a teenager - but the expectation is that it will before the end of August.
Without further additions there may be some considerable friction in the Dutchman converting Sam Allardyce's effective direct team in to a possession-based side as the Dutchman is likely to want. Last season's record signing Christian Benteke will be better for a season at the club, while the loan of Ruben Loftus-Cheek will bring bite to the midfield and Wilfred Saha committing his future to the club means they have weapons already within the squad.
BUSINESS RATING: 3/10
Everton

IN:
Jordan Pickford (Sunderland - $41m), Michael Keane (Burnley - $41m), Davy Klaassen (Ajax - $39m), Henry Onyekuru (Eupen - $11.5m), Sandro Ramirez (Malaga - $8.7m), Wayne Rooney (Manchester United - undisclosed), Cuco Martina (Southampton - free transfer), Josh Bowler (QPR - undisclosed), Boris Mathis (Metz - undisclosed), Nathangelo Markelo (FC Volendam - undisclosed)
OUT:
Romelu Lukaku (Manchester United - $123m), Gerard Deulofeu (Barcelona - $16.5), Tom Cleverley (Watford - $13m), Courtney Duffus (Oldham Athletic - undisclosed), Aiden McGeady (released), Anton Donkor (Wolfsburg - loan), Joe Williams (Barnsley - loan), Henry Onyekuru (Anderlecht - loan), Russell Griffiths (released), Kieran Dowell (Nottingham Forrest - loan), Antonee Robinson (Bolton - loan)
AFTER years of scratching around and doing late deals in the transfer window, Everton have been the most proactive, ambitious and, on the face of it, successful traders of this off season. The intention of Ronald Koeman has been backed by Farhad Moshiri's cheque book - even if the sale of Romelu Lukaku has all but squared the ledger for now. The team has been overhauled with quality, especially in signing one of the best young goalkeepers in the country in Jordan Pickford, Ajax's exceptional captain Davy Klassen and Michael Keane, one of the most highly regarded centre backs in the Premier League last season.
There was even room for sentiment in bringing Wayne Rooney home. Ross Barkly's all-but-confirmed departure is unlikely to cause any significant upheaval, especially if the more reliable Guilfy Sigardsson can be signed from Swansea. A more established centre forward to make up for the loss of Lukaku's goals is probably still needed if the promise is to turn in to a genuine bid for a top four finish, though Sandro Ramirez has many admirers in that position. The only danger appears to be the issue of gelling a renovated side together quickly, but with business done early Koeman has his new look side for virtually a full pre-season.
BUSINESS RATING: 9/10
Huddersfield Town

IN:
Aaron Mooy (Manchester City - $13m), Steve Mounie (Montpellier - $19m), Tom Ince (Derby County - $13m), Laurent Depoitre (FC Porto - $7.2m), Scott Malone (Fulham - $5.8m), Mathias Jorgensen (FC Copenhagen - $3.3m), Jonas Lossal (Mainz 05 - loan), Kasey Palmer (Chelsea - loan), Danny Williams (Reading - free transfer)
OUT:
Tareiq Holmes-Dennis (Portsmouth - loan), Rekeil Pyke (Port Vale - loan), Kack Payne (Oxford United - loan), Fraser Horsfall (Gateshead - loan), Jordy Hiwula (Fleetwood Town - loan)
A BUSY transfer window hints at either an intent not to simply make up the numbers in Huddersfield's first, unlikely, appearance at the top level in four decades or the pragmatic structuring of a squad perfectly equipped to push for the Championship title the season after this one. The truth probably lies somewhere in between.
In Scott Malone, Tom Ince, Danny Williams, Aaron Mooy - the pivot of the team last season whose return was vital for continuity - and the renewed loan signing of Kasey Palmer, manager David Wagner has brought to the club half of a contestable team of the season from last year's second tier.
However, strikers Steve Mounie and Laurent Depoitre, and elegant defender Mathias Jorgensen, all have European experience. Mounie is strong both in the air and on the ground and could be one of the surprise packages of the division
Wagner's team play a high energy, pressing and possession based game and would not be served by changing that even against better teams. Last season's defence was the rock upon which promotion was gained - this window has seen goal scoring options increased. And, more specifically, reserves in every position now in place to offer competition for places and cover for what will be a fight for survival from day one.
BUSINESS RATING: 7/10
Leicester City

IN:
Kelechi Iheanacho (Manchester City - $41m), Harry Maguire (Hull City - $28m), Vincent Iborra (Sevilla - $20m), Eldin Jakupovic (Hull City - $3.3m), Sam Hughes (Chester City - undisclosed)
OUT:
Ron-Robert Zieler (Stuttgart - $4.1m), Bartosz Kapustka (Freiburg - loan), Callum Elder (Wigan Athletic - loan), Marcin Wasilewski (released)
AS LEICESTER try to forge an identity beyond that of one season wonders - but what a season of wonder it was - their transfer dealings have been characterised by a solid pragmatism that should serve them well. Landing the signature of the impressive Hull centre-back Harry Maguire when he had been linked with a move to Tottenham was a victory. Adding the raw talent up top of Kelechi Iheanacho should re-energise a forward line that appeared to have lost its dynamism last season, Jamie Vardy failing to reproduce, consistently, his title winning form.
Vincent Iborra seems well suited to the demands of the Premier League, the tough tackling midfielder impressing the Leicester staff when the sides met in the Champions League last season. Both signings should bring a robustness to the side that had developed a soft centre with age catching up with Robert Huth and Wes Morgan and the N'Golo Kante shaped hole not adequately filled last season. Should they succeed in fending off an aggressive approach for Riyad Mahrez from Roma, they should spend next season looking up again rather than over their shoulders.
BUSINESS RATING: 7/10
Liverpool

IN:
Mohamed Salah (Roma - $61m), Andrew Robertson (Hull City - $13m), Dominic Solanke (Chelsea - released)
OUT:
Lucas Leiva (Lazio - $8.2m), Kevin Stewart (Hull City - $8.9m), Andre Wisdom (Derby County - $3.3m), Alex Manninger (released), Madgar Gomes (released), Ryan Fulton (Hamilton - undisclosed), Connor Randall (Hearts - loan), Adam Phillips (released)
AS WITH Arsenal, one record signing does not a successful summer window make. Yet. Mo Salah is a versatile forward who can play on the right or through the middle and adds to Jurgen Klopp's already well stocked options in the attacking third of the pitch, especially with the capture of England age group striker Dominic Solanke from Chelsea.
It is at the other end where serious work still needs to be done beyond the necessary signing of a left back, Andrew Robertson having impressed even during Hull City's relegation last term, which will free up James Milner to bring his Swiss Army knife versatility to other areas of the pitch. Virgil Van Dyke was supposed to be one part of the answer to Liverpool's questionable defensive robustness - and still might be - but the inelegant way the approach for him to Southampton was conducted has comprised that and Klopp may need to look elsewhere before the end of August. It has been a frustrating window for the German, with RB Leipzig playing hard ball over Naby Keita, a player who would fill a much needed defensive role in Liverpool's midfield, and the Van Dyke drama. Should either or both of those deals go through - and Philippe Countinho be kept from Barcelona's grasp - all big ifs - a genuine if still brittle title challenge could be on. If not, Liverpool may again impress at times but lack the strength to break a 28 year championship drought.
BUSINESS RATING: 5/10
Manchester City

IN:
Benjamin Mendy (Monaco - $85.5m), Bernardo Silva (Monaco - $72m), Kyle Walker (Tottenham - $82m), Ederson (Benfica - $57m), Danilo (Real Madrid - $43.5m), Douglas Luiz (Vasco da Gama - $16.4m)
OUT:
Kelechi Iheanacho (Leicester City - $41m), Aaron Mooy (Huddersfield Town - $13m), Enes Unal (Villarreal - $19.7m), Nolito (Sevilla - $13m), Fernando (Galatasary - $9m), Aleksander Kolarov (Roma - $7.4m), Oliver Ntcham (Celtic - $6.5m), Ruben Sobrino (Alaves - $3m), Bacary Sagna (released), Bruno Zuculini (Verona - undisclosed), Willy Caballero (Chelsea - free transfer), Jesus Navas (released), Pablo Zabaleta (released), Gael Clichy (released), Angus Gunn (Norwich City - loan), Anthony Caceres (Al-Wasl - loan), James Horsfield (NAC Breda - undisclosed), Alexi Garcia (Girona - loan), Rodney Kongolo (Doncaster Rovers - loan)
THAT Pep Guardiola has now spent more on his defence in the year he has been at Manchester City than Bosnia spent on theirs (the country's army, that is, not payments to footballers), says everything about his priorities this transfer window. Over $200m on full backs alone really ought to have an impact. Benjamin Mendy and Kyle Walker were sensational going forward for Monaco and Spurs respectively last season. Even in his defenders Guardiola sees attack as the first instinct.
The Catalan's search for his perfect goalkeeper has seen him spend big, again, this time on Ederson from Benfica. After ditching Joe Hart as his first act at the club and a failed punt on Claudio Bravo, Guardiola's judgment will be questioned should his latest no. 1 fail to impress. Bernardo Silva was another reason Monaco reached the Champions League semi-finals last term and brings extra support to the front end of the team already performing well enough in that department. City have a galaxy of stars from back to front now and a Galctico of a manager. They are justified favourites for the title as a result.
BUSINESS RATING: 8/10
Manchester United

IN:
Romelu Lukaku (Everton - $123m), Nemanja Matic (Chelsea $66m), Victor Lindelof (Benfica - $51m)
OUT:
Adnan Januzaj (Real Sociedad - $16m), Wayne Rooney (Everton - undisclosed), Sam Johnstone (Aston Villa - loan), Dean Henderson (Shrewsbury Town - loan), Sam Johnstone (Aston Villa - loan), Devonte Redmond (Scunthorpe United - loan), Josh Harrop (released)
WHILE his title rivals have been doing football's version of a trolley dash around Europe's boutique clubs, Jose Mourinho has had a less frenetic - if not much less expensive - time of it at Old Trafford. Romelu Lukaka came at a premium but for the lavish outlay has both youth and experience on his side, and a proven track record of goal scoring in the Premier League. Victor Lindelof is the type of no nonsense centre back favoured by the Portuguese.
The two players should slot easily in to each end of the pitch without disruption. As should Nemanja Matic, a spine possibly returned to a side who seemed to lose theirs in the post-Ferguson era. More will be expected - or demanded - of last season's big money signing, Paul Pogba. The departure of Wayne Rooney should see one element of the circus leave town, at the same time as making this feel entirely like a Mournho team. United were hard to beat last season but not always easy on the eye. Mourinho has always won the title in his second season at a club. The tweaks to the side this summer and another pre-season to get his dogmatic ideals across ought to make United challengers rather than also-rans once again.
TRANSFER RATING: 7/10
Newcastle United

IN:
Jacob Murphy (Norwich City - $19.7m), Florian Lejeune (Eibar - $14.3m), Christian Atsu (Chelsea - $9.9m), Javier Manquillo (Atletico Madrid - $7.4m), Josef Varney (Everton - released), Stefan O'Connor (Arsenal - released), Mikel Merino (Borussia Dortmund - loan)
OUT:
Daryl Murphy (Nottingham Forest - $3.3m), Kevin Mbabu (Young boys - $870,000), Florian Thauvin (Marseille - undisclosed), Yoan Gouffran (released), Sammy Ameobi (released), Vurnon Anita (Leeds united - free transfer), Matz Sels (Anderlecht - loan), Sean Longstaff (Blackpool - loan), Adam Armstrong (Bolton - loan), Ivan Toney (Wigan Athletic - loan)
OF THE three promoted teams, Newcastle carry greatest expectancy to prosper, and a better chance of effective rejuvenation of the team for the higher purpose. The pull of Rafa Bentiez and a habitually sold out St James' Park the primary reasons for both. However, Newcastle's recruitment has been more towards the underwhelming side, whether through missed targets or any reluctance from the mistrusted Mike Ashley to release funds.
Florian Lejeune adds depth to the defence while Christian Atsu's loan move was made permanent. England Under-21 wide man Jacob Murphy looks a talent, though is new to the Premier League after leaving Championship side Norwich. Bentiez's reputation appears to have been key to the most interesting of their signings, Spanish Under 21 international Javier Manquillo, a potential steal at $7.4m should the right back fulfil his massive potential. An increase to the head count and some Premier League experience might be vital for Newcastle between now and the end of August, if Ashley and Bentiez can work together to produce it.
BUSINESS RATING: 6/10
Southampton

IN:
Jan Bednarek (Lech Poznan - $9.4m)
OUT:
Jay Rodriguez (West Brom - $19.7m), Jason McCarthy (Barnsley - undisclosed), Martin Caceres (released), Cuco Martina (Everton - free transfer), Harry Lewis (Dundee United - loan), Ryan Seager (MK Dons - loan), Lloyd Isgrove (released), Harrison Reed (Norwich City - loan)
ANOTHER transfer window, another period of upheaval and uncertainty at St Marys. The club's much vaunted structural stability and progressiveness, married to a productive youth academy, has so far kept them competing at the right end of the league despite a number of high profile departures from the playing squad and regular managerial changes. Mauricio Pellegrino arrives with a solid reputation built as an assistant to Rafa Benitez at Valencia and Inter Milan and, more recently, guiding Alaves to the top flight in Spain and consolidating there last season.
The only new arrival so far has been Polish international defender Jan Bednarek. Jay Rodriguez has left though Saints have adequate cover up front in the form of Manolo Gabbiadini, Charlie Austin and Shane Long. Much will depend on if they can hold on to Virgil Van Dyke. That seems unlikely after the player went on strike. More recruits are needed for Southampton not to go backwards, especially if the Dutch defender takes the well-worn path form the South Coast to Anfield.
BUSINESS RATING: 2/10
Stoke City

IN:
Kurt Zouma (Chelsea - loan), Darren Fletcher (West Brom - free transfer), Tre Pemberton (Blackburn Rovers - undisclosed), Josh Tymon (Hull City - undisclosed)
OUT:
Marko Arnautovic (West Ham United - $33m), Jonathan Walters (Burnley - $4.9m), Glenn Whelan (Aston Villa - $2.1m), Phil Bardsley (Burnley - $3.3m), Shay Given (released), Joel Taylor (released), Daniel Bachmann (released), Ryan Sweeney (Bristol Rovers - loan), Dominic Telford (Bristol Rovers - loan)
DARREN Fletcher should provide some much needed leadership in the Stoke midfield and Kurt Zouma will have a point to prove after being overlooked at Chelsea, but neither acquisition inspires great excitement. Josh Tymon is a future talent at left back but there is concern over where the goals will come from this season.
Marko Arnautovic was hot and cold last campaign but when on his game provided a spark, while Jonathan Walters was a reliable workhorse up top that may be more missed than some imagine. Pace, youth and quality are needed to be injected in to a side that has plateaued in recent seasons despite lavish investment. Without it, a first relegation battle in many seasons may be on the cards.
BUSINESS RATING: 3/10
Swansea City

IN:
Roque Mesa (Las Palmas - $18m), Modou Barrow (Reading - $2.5m), Cian Harries (Coventry City - $800,000), Marc Walsh (Finn Harps - undisclosed), Erwin Mulder (Heerenveen - released), Tammy Abraham (Chelsea - loan)
OUT:
Jack Cork (Burnley - $13m), Marvin Emnes (released), Alex Samuel (Stevenage - undisclosed), Bafetimbi Gomis (Galatasaray - undisclosed), Jordi Amat (Real Betis - loan), Connor Roberts (Middlesbrough - loan), Josh Vickers (released), Tom Holland (released), Keston Davies (Yeovil Town - loan)
SWANSEA'S transfer dealings - in terms of players coming in at least - have not hit the headlines, but look to have strengthened a side that desperately needed it after flirting with relegation last term. Tammy Abraham, one of Chelsea's legion of on loan players, is a genuine goal threat for a side that looked toothless last season, while Roque Mesa is a classic Swansea ball playing midfielder of the tika-taka school.
The defence needs strengthening across the line and expect Paul Clement to conduct more business once the Gylfi Sigurdsson windfall drops. Losing a player of his quality would be a blow but the figures being banded about for a sale mean the manager will have no excuses for failing to improve the team should he be allowed to immediately reinvest.
BUSINESS RATING: 6/10
Tottenham Hotspur

IN:
None
OUT:
Kyle Walker (Manchester City - $82), Nabil Bentaleb (Schalke 04 - $27.6m), Clinton N'Jie (Marseille - $10m), Federico Fazio (Roma - $4.6m), Luke McGee (Portsmouth - undisclosed), Connor Ogilvie (Gillingham - loan), Josh Onomah (Aston Villa - loan)
CHAIRMAN Daniel Levy is renowned for doing tough business and reducing or increasing transfer fees in his favour until the last possible moment. He has been vocal, too, in criticising the 'unsustainable' spending of Premier League clubs. There is perhaps some validity to that, but as even his manager has recently stated, that is the reality and Spurs need to invest to maintain another title challenge, having not signed a single player yet while bringing in $125m in receipts.
That surely won't be the case come the end of the window. Kieran Tripper is a ready-made replacement for Kyle Walker, though Mauricio Pochettino rotated his full backs last season, such is the demand his style places on them, and Spurs have been linked with PSG's Serge Aurier. Expect some late business at the club.
BUSINESS RATING: 0/10
Watford

IN:
Tom Cleverley (Everton - $13m), Will Hughes (Derby County - $13m), Nathaniel Chalobah (Chelsea - $8.2m), Kiko Femenia (Alaves - free transfer), Daniel Bachmann (Stoke City - released)
OUT:
Sven Kums (Anderlecht - $9.4m), Mario Suarez (Guizhou - $8.2m), Steven Berghuis (Feyenoord - $8.2m), Obbi Oulare (Royal Antwerp - loan), Dennon Lewis (Crawley Town - loan), Rene Gilmartin (released)
A ROTTEN second half of last season needed a response, and in hiring the former Hull City manager Marco Silva they ought to have bought themselves a shot at organisation and tactical intelligence absent last term. A revolving door international player recruitment policy in recent seasons has created an air of transiency to the squad but making the loan move for Tom Cleverly permanent and the capture of promising England Under-21 international Will Hughes looks like a move designed to bring some local solidity to the side.
The defensively minded Nathaniel Chalobah will bring legs to the centre of the pitch and optimism is high for an improved showing. Though it should be noted that, for all his impressive impact at Hull last season, Silva could not prevent their relegation. Survival will be success.
BUSINESS RATING: 5/10
West Bromwich Albion

IN:
Jay Rodriquez (Southampton - $19.7m), Ben Pierce (free agent), Yuning Zhang (Vitesse Arnhem - undisclosed), Ahmed Hegazi (Al Ahly - loan)
OUT:
Darren Fletcher (Stoke City - free transfer), Sebastien Pocognoli (Standard Liege - free transfer), Jack Fitzwater (Forest Green Rovers - loan), Yuning Zhang (Werder Bremen - loan)
THE CHINESE money now behind the club hasn't fed through yet to big money transfers at the Hawthorns. Jay Rodriquez may bring the goals the side so desperately need, though was hardly electric during his difficult time at Southampton.
The loss of Darren Fletcher may hamper on-field organisation and structure and a new centre-back, holding midfielder and ideally another striker need to be brought in before the window closes or a slog of a season lies ahead for a club that over performed in securing mid-table respectability last time out.
BUSINESS RATING: 2/10
West Ham United

IN:
Marko Arnautovic (Stoke City - $33m), Javier Hernandez (Bayer Leverkusen - $26.4m), Pablo Zabaleta (Manchester City - free transfer), Joe Hart (Manchester City - loan)
OUT:
Ashley Fletcher (Middlesbrough - $10.7m), Enner Valencia (Tigres - $8.2m), Darren Randolph (Middlesbrough - $8.2m), Havard Nordtveit (Hoffenheim - $3m), George Dobson (Sparta Rotterdam - undisclosed), Reece Oxford (Borussia Monchengladbach - loan), Alvaro Arbeloa (released), Sam Westley (released), Raphael Spiegel (released), Kyle Knoyle (released)
HAMMERS manager Slaven Bilic has plumped for the tried and tested and made a notable move to bring leaders in to the team with personality, something sorely missing last term as the club lurched from one drama to the next in their first difficult season in the Olympic Stadium. Joe Hart may be unfancied by Pep Guardiola but he's still England's no. 1, while Javier Hernandez and Pablo Zabaleta, like Hart, have Premier League winners medals in their cabinets.
Hernandez is an energetic and reliable goal scorer and though Zabaleta may at times be done for pace, his physical presence and positional sense means he is a tidy free addition. Marko Arnautovic may excite the fans more, capable as he is of the truly exceptional, though the others will bring the solidity that should ensure a comfortable top half finish.
