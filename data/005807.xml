  <content>
FIRE has damaged  two-storey house at Golden Bay, near Mandurah, this afternoon.
A Department of Fire and Emergency Services spokesperson said the blaze started inside the garage just before 4.30pm.
Fire crews from Rockingham, Mandurah, Singleton and Secret Harbour tried to save the second storey of the Yanrey Street home as flames quickly spread through the roof.

The fire was brought under control by 5.10pm with firefighters then entering the house to salvage what they could.
It's believed the cause of the fire is accidental.
A DFES spokesperson said no one was home at the time.
