  <title>North Melbourne star Ben Brown carted off after tackle from Collingwood ruckman Brodie Grundy</title>

Star North Melbourne forward Ben Brown was carted off Etihad Stadium on Saturday night after his head sickeningly slammed into the ground after a tackle from Collingwood ruckman Brodie Grundy.
In circumstances reminiscent to those at the same venue a week ago when Geelong superstar Patrick Dangerfield was suspended for a tackle that concussed Carlton's Matthew Kreuzer, Grundy pinned Brown's arms as Brown - among the leaders in the Coleman medal race - tried to dispose of the ball. Brown got rid of the ball as he was being taken to ground, but was not released by Grundy. The Roo's head thudded into the Docklands turf, and he looked to be knocked out as soon as he hit the ground.Photo: AAP
North medicos showed extreme caution in removing Brown from the ground, taking more than five minutes before he was taken off.
