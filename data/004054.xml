  <title>US home invader frightened away by girl's scream</title>
  <content>
A US home invader has fled a Chicago property empty handed after a girl screamed for help.

Home security video taken from inside the Illinois house on July 23 showed a man kick open the front door and cautiously step inside.

A 16-year-old girl who was home alone at the time locked herself in a bedroom and called her mother - who was at work.

Her mother logged into the security camera via an app on her phone.

"My heart dropped. My body started shaking," the mother told WGN-TV.

Mount Prospect Police said the girl heard a man knocking on the door. When she didn't answer the intruder forced his way into the property.

The girl told police she screamed when the man came up the stairs and tried to open the locked bedroom door.
