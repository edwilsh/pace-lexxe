  <title>Watch 5000 Jedi Completely Wipe Out 25,000 Soldiers And The Horses They're Riding</title>
  <content>
Video: Jedi were supposed to be the peaceful protectors of the galaxy, only resorting to fighting when needed, or whenever a conversation at a bar got too heated. But thanks to a PC game called Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator, we can finally watch the Jedi become the galaxy's biggest bullies.

We last saw the Jedi wipe out some , whom, I guess, called in the cavalry as they gave up the Force ghost:

That's not to say this massive cavalry army of 25,000 soldiers on horseback wasn't up to no good. There's probably a good reason these 5000 Jedi cut through all of them like a hot lightsaber through butter, even though they were outnumbered five to one. But having to watch so many horses die in the slaughter is a little heartbreaking. Hopefully they don't smell as bad as 25,000 dead Tauntauns would.
