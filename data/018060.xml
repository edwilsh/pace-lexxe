  <title>Melbourne council to build emissions-free rubbish trucks by 2020</title>
  <content>
Australia's diesel-fuelled garbage truck fleet could be about to begin turning emissions-free, as a council in Melbourne's inner north is adapting its trucks to hydrogen fuel.
The Moreland City Council said it believed other local governments would follow in its footsteps.
"This is about changing the fuel source of heavy vehicles for councils," Victorian Environment Minister Lily D'Ambrosio said.
"There would be councils right across the country that will be looking very closely, very eagerly, for the rollout of this project,"
Trucks to run on alternative energy

As part of the $9 million project, Australia's first commercial-scale hydrogen refuelling station will be built in the local area.
It will run on grid-supplied wind power and locally-produced solar power.
When operating, the Moreland Council predicted the truck fleet would involve similar staff and maintenance levels to the current diesel-powered fleet.
"The cost will be equivalent to the cost of running the trucks that we currently run," Moreland Mayor Helen Davidson said.
Under the plan, 12 of the council's 18 trucks will be zero-emissions by early 2020.
The Victorian Government estimated the project would create 15 jobs as people built the prototype, and potentially more than 100 indirect positions in fuel cell component manufacturing.
"There will be a dramatic reduction in noise," Hydrogen Utility's Attilio Pigneri said.
He predicted the trucks would be about 70 per cent less noisy compared with current models.
"Residents will look forward to the day when they won't be woken up by noisy trucks collecting their rubbish," he said.
