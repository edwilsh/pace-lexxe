  <title>Sydney's Haymarket HQ will host Alibaba's global startup contest</title>
  <content>
Chinese conglomerate Alibaba has announced it's bringing its global startup contest to Sydney tech hub Haymarket HQ next month.

The cloud computing arm of the tech giant, Alibaba Cloud, has established an Australia & New Zealand arm of its international  Cloud competition, with the local winner to compete in the global final in Shanghai.

As well as the expenses to cover the Shanghai trip in November, the winning venture will receive $US50,000 in credit for cloud computing resources, "preferential access" to Alibaba Group's early stage startup investment programmes and free access to Haymarket HQ.

Haymarket HQ, located in Chinatown in inner city Sydney, is a co-working, collaboration and mentoring facility designed for startups specifically targetting the Asian market,  by Banna Property Group's Brad Chan.

"We see a growing trend in the ANZ region of start-ups looking to engage with Asian markets," said Haymarket HQ general manager Duco van Breemen.

"By partnering with Alibaba Cloud, one of the largest cloud providers in the Asia Pacific region and globally, we are helping start-ups across the region explore new opportunities."

The ANZ contest of  Cloud will be held on September 22, with entries accepted until August 31.
