  <title>Million-dollar ice haul found in Rockhampton after police follow car into drive-through</title>
  <content>
About $1 million worth of ice has been found concealed under a car's floor panel after its owners pulled into a fast food drive-through for an early morning meal.
After receiving a tip-off, officers followed the car into the Rockhampton McDonalds to uncover the five kilograms of the drug about 4:00am.
Two Brisbane men, in their 30s, have been charged and are due to appear in the Rockhampton Magistrates Court on Wednesday.
Detective Senior Sergeant Luke Peachy said the haul, worth about $1 million wholesale, is the most significant ever made in the region.
"It's huge," he said.
"It's the largest amount of drug I've seen in Rockhampton or in fact, any other place I've worked in regional Queensland.
"The amount of drug is very, very significant and we're very please to have gotten this off the street before it hits the street."
