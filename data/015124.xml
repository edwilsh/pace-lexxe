  <title>Basketball Australia launch new singlets as Matthew Dellavedova looks to 2018</title>
  <content>
Basketball Australia launched its new singlets on Friday and Matthew Dellavedova confirmed he would look forward to wearing them in next year's FIBA World Cup qualifiers.

The new deal will see Boomers and Opals gear widely available at sports retailers and with the FIBA World Cup in China in 2019, having the Chinese-based PEAK as a sponsor could open new doors for BA.
Dellavedova and his fellow overseas-based Boomers were given this winter off by coach Andrej Lemanis as they prepare for a busy three years leading up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
The Milwaukee Bucks guard confirmed he had a coffee in Brisbane with Lemanis recently to hear what the coach had planned.

The Boomers are still playing this winter with an NBL-based side which begins their FIBA Asia Cup campaign in Lebanon against Japan on Tuesday night.
Dellavedova said he was rested and "hitting the weight room hard" during his break.
"I'm definitely looking forward to pulling on the green and gold next year," Dellavedova said.
"It will be tough watching the qualifiers as I'm sure it is for all the other boys.
"Hopefully I will play in the June/July window and we were talking about the August/September window but that is getting close to [NBA] training camp.
"If they can get it really early in the September window and some home games hopefully we can work something out."
The Boomers now play in Asia under FIBA's new qualifying format which has four quarterly windows each made up of two games with the new format starting this November.
NBA players will not be released in season so the NBL-based players will play in many of the qualifiers especially in November and February.
The new men's singlets have a rounded neck and higher shoulders with Dellavedova comparing the look to "old school" Boomers singlets from his childhood.
The womens singlets have a V-shaped neck and slimmer shoulders.
The Boomers will debut the new singlets at the Asia Cup starting on Tuesday when the Boomers face Japan at 11pm.
