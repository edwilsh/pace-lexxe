  <title>Barca bombshell! Club CONFIRMS Neymar wants to go</title>
  <content>
BARCELONA says Neymar plans to leave the club amid rumours of a blockbuster move to Paris Saint-Germain.
The club says the Brazil striker told his teammates Wednesday "that he had the intention of leaving the club and seeking his future elsewhere, and the coach has given him permission to leave training."
PSG is rumoured to be ready to pay his release clause of 222 million euros ($327 million).
That would dwarf the 105 million euros (then $166 million) that Manchester United paid for France midfielder Paul Pogba last year.
Barcelona says Neymar left the training ground 30 minutes after arriving on Wednesday.

BREAKING:  give Neymar permission to miss training this morning. More on Sky Sports News.

Neymar hasn't trained with Barcelona today. Deal close with PSG but still not yet signed.

Neymar didn't train today + told team mates he's off to PSG. Key players were fed up with situation and wanted him to say it to the group.
