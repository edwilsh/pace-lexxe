A former corporate executive has been arrested in Sydney's east and charged with defrauding a company of $4.5 million.
Police allege the 63-year-old man, a former director of a company, made 621 unauthorised transactions totalling $4,479,753 from the firm's account to a number of credit cards as well as unauthorised cash withdrawals.
The alleged frauds took place between October 2012 and September 2015.
Detectives established Strike Force Tawny in September 2015 to investigate the transactions.
Detectives arrested the man at a residence in Double Bay at 11.30 on Friday morning.
He was taken to Waverley Police Station and charged with four counts of dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception.
He was given conditional bail to appear at Waverley Local Court on 5 September 2017.
