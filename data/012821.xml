  <title>Axed spin doctor cashes back in</title>

THE State Government has re-employed a top bureaucrat just a year after he was effectively sacked with a golden handshake.
Paul Flanagan has been employed in a highly paid position as the chief of staff to Tourism Minister, Leon Bignell.
A State Government spokeswoman said Mr Flanagan had "the significant skills, knowledge and experience required to undertake the role."
Opposition spokesman Rob Lucas said the appointment was one of the worst cases of "jobs for the boys" he's seen.
"This appointment is another example of (Premier) Jay Weatherill saying, 'stuff you' to the taxpayer, we'll do as we like", he said.
Mr Flanagan was paid out about $250,000 after losing his position as a spin doctor in the Department of Premier and Cabinet.
The spokeswoman said he had paid back the balance of his payout.
