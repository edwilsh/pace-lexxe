"The Australian Defence Force has commenced its support to US-led recovery operations following the MV-22 Osprey incident in Shoalwater Bay on Saturday," the statement said.

"Royal Australian Navy survey ship HMAS Melville arrived to Shoalwater Bay overnight. Shortly after commencing survey operations in the area, the submerged aircraft was located."
Navy divers are now working with the crew of HMAS Melville at the wreckage site, using remotely operated underwater vehicles.
The government would offer further support as required, the statement said.
