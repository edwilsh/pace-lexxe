  <title>NAPLAN results prompt SA Government to spend $67.5 million on public education</title>
  <content>
The South Australian Government has conceded more must be done to lift NAPLAN results, after the latest scores revealed South Australia is the worst performing mainland state across most categories.
The Education Minister Susan Close has announced $67.5 million will be spent over four years to boost results in the state's struggling public primary schools.
, show South Australia is the worst performing mainland state in 16 out of 20 categories.
Average numeracy scores improved, but average writing scores were down by almost 2.5 per cent.
Education Minister Susan Close said there was "no doubt" the state needed to improve its performance.
"There are some good signs in the data... but it's not enough," she said.
"Improvements do cost money [and] we have a $70 million injection over the next four years for our public primary schools, for more teachers and better strategies.
"We'll take NAPLAN data and other school data and identify public primary school students who need assistance, and they'll get it."
Shadow Education Minister John Gardner said the results put South Australia well below the national average.
"It's hardly conceivable but on a number of measures South Australia's results have gone backwards - even on last year's poor results," he said.
"Labor's 15 years of restructures, scandals and uncertainty... has left our education system at the back of the class once again.
"The Weatherill Government has failed our children."
Nationally, reading and numeracy scores have improved since 2008 but writing scores have declined since 2011.
Queensland and Western Australia have shown the most improvement since 2008.
