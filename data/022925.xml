  <title>Brisbane bus drivers to refuse fares again</title>
  <content>
Bus drivers will again refuse to accept fares from passengers this week as part of an ongoing dispute with Brisbane City Council over pay, safety and rosters.
The Rail, Tram and Bus Union on Monday confirmed its drivers would offer free travel all day on Wednesday and Thursday.
It will be the fourth week in a row that drivers have taken industrial action, as the council and union fails to come together over a new enterprise agreement.
