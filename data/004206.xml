A man in a wheelchair has died after falling off a cliff at a beach in Sydney's east.
Paramedics were called to Steel Point Steps at Vaucluse about 10.40am on Tuesday following reports an elderly man had fallen about 10 metres.
The man died at the scene and the circumstances surrounding the fall are not yet known, a NSW Police spokesman said.
Television footage showed a number of police and paramedics on the beach, surrounding a body covered by a white blanket.
The man is believed to be aged in his 70s, a NSW Ambulance spokesman said.
