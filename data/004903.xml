YESTERDAY marked the start of National Missing Persons Week, which this year focuses on the high number of youths reported missing annually.
On average, 100 people are reported missing in Queensland every week and while many are found, there are still families waiting for news of their loved ones.
Nine people from the Sunshine Coast region are currently listed as missing on the Queensland Police Service website with some not heard from in decades.
If you have information for police, contact Policelink on 131 444 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
