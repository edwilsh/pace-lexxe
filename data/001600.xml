  <title>The burning questions following Danger's ban</title>
  <content>
THE suspension offered to Patrick Dangerfield for a dangerous tackle on Matthew Kreuzer has thrown the race for the 2017 Brownlow Medal into chaos.
The Geelong superstar, who is the reigning winner of the award and a raging favourite to go back-to-back, was offered a one-week ban for rough conduct by the MRP following an incident on Saturday night.
Dangerfield pinned Kreuzer's arms in a tackle during Geelong's victory over Carlton, with the Blues ruckman suffering a mild concussion as his head was dumped into the turf.
The ban leaves Dangerfield's Brownlow chances up in smoke - and blows the race for footy's most prestigious individual honour wide open.
Richmond midfielder Dustin Martin is the new favourite, while Hawthorn recruit Tom Mitchell and Essendon youngster Zach Merrett are close behind.
But what does this mean for Dangerfield?
We answer the five burning questions following his unfortunate and untimely suspension.
LISTEN TO THE ROUND 19 REVIEW FOX FOOTY PODCAST BELOW, OR
DID HE DESERVE TO BE SUSPENDED?
UNDER the MRP's interpretation of a 'dangerous tackle', then yes he did.
The MRP rules suggest a dangerous tackle is one that puts an opposition player in a 'vulnerable position (i.e. arms pinned) with little opportunity to protect himself'. Dangerfield pinned Kreuzer's arm in the initial tackle, with one arm freeing itself as his head hit the turf.
The MRP also determines a dangerous tackle as one where an opponent is 'slung, driven or rotated into the ground with excessive force'.
Given this was a driving tackle with enough force to leave Kreuzer with a concussion, it also fits that bracket.
Once deemed a dangerous tackle, the MRP ruled the act as careless conduct, with medium impact to a high area of the body.
That constitutes a two-week ban, which can be reduced to one match with an early guilty plea. It's hard to argue with that.
WHAT HAPPENS NOW?
THE first question has to be: will the Cats appeal Dangerfield's suspension?
If they believe they can successfully counter the verdict - that this was a 'dangerous tackle' - then the reigning Brownlow Medallist could be cleared altogether.
But that call comes with a big risk.
If the Cats' appeal was unsuccessful, Dangerfield would lose the benefit of an early guilty plea - meaning a two-week suspension, instead of one.
That would see the superstar miss both the Round 20 clash with Sydney and the Round 21 crunch game against the Tigers.
So are the Cats willing to take the risk?
If Dangerfield accepts his suspension, or a potential appeal fails, we could have a very awkward Brownlow Medal night. Normally, suspended players aren't obliged to show up.
However, as a previous winner, Dangerfield will. And should he poll more votes than whoever finished in second place, as the reigning winner he will have to present the award to someone who finished with fewer votes than he did.
That will no doubt be an uncomfortable experience for the Cats superstar. But it could be even more awkward for the player who wins the Brownlow.

AFL: Patrick Dangerfield is not worried about any repurcussions regarding his 'head slam' tackle against the Blues.

Danger not concerned
WAS HE GOING TO WIN ANYWAY?
AT this stage, it's more than likely.
Dangerfield won the 2016 Brownlow Medal with a record 35 votes and, so far this season, has improved in almost every key statistical category.
He's averaging 30.1 disposals, but has gone forward more and has kicked 35 goals from 18 games, which is already a career high.
He's averaging more tackles (5.7), clearances (7.2) and contested possessions (17.6) than last year, while his Champion Data ranking points have also lifted from 131.8 per game last year to 134.1 per game this season.
By our count, Dangerfield can expect to poll in around 13 of 18 games so far this season, with the overwhelming majority of those likely to be three-vote games. That will put him in prime position on Brownlow night.

IS IT DUSTY'S TO LOSE?
IT is now.
Martin has long been the second favourite to Dangerfield and - unless the Geelong star successfully appeals his suspension - will now take his place as the man many expect to claim the award.
The Richmond star finished with 25 votes last season, 10 off Dangerfield's pace, but has improved significantly this year.
He's averaging 30.1 disposals per game and has kicked 24 goals from 18 matches.
He's ranked in the top 10 in the competition for disposals, goal assists, contested possessions, clearances and metres gained.
We expect him to poll in around 13 of 18 games, which would almost certainly be enough.
WHAT HAS THIS DONE TO THE ODDS?
SOME crazy stuff.
Dangerfield was last week a $2 favourite with Crownbet, while Martin was close behind at $2.05.
However, following Dangerfield's suspension, Martin has firmed to very shot odds of $1.20 odds..
Mitchell has firmed from $10 to $6, making him the second favourite, while the rest of the field has remained similar. Merrett remains third favourite with Crownbet, but his odds have steadied at $13.
