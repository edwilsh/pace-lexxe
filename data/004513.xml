  <title>Brumbies duo leaving to take up overseas deals</title>
  <content>
RUGBY UNION: The Brumbies have lost two experienced players, with Argentine international Tomas Cubelli and openside flanker Chris Alcock both confirming they are leaving to pursue opportunities overseas.

Scrum-half Cubelli is set to return home to play for the Jaguares, while Alcock will join Japanese club Kamaishi Seawaves.

"I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the Brumbies and have nothing but good things to say about my time in Canberra," Alcock, 29, said.

"Playing at GIO Stadium in front of our loyal supporters was great fun and I believe that the Brumbies have a great young group that can achieve huge things in the future.

"I head to Japan for a new adventure in my life and am looking forward to the challenge ahead.

"Thank you all for your support during my time at the club."

The pain of Alcock's departure will be eased by the return of David Pocock, who has been on sabbatical this year.

Cubelli's time with the Brumbies was marred by a knee injury, although he made a successful return in the final weeks of the season.

"I had a very enjoyable two seasons at the Brumbies and thank everyone connected with the club for their support during my time here," Cubelli said.

"The Brumbies are a very special organisation and I feel privileged to have been able to play for such a great team.

"I have made many friends in Canberra and Australia and am looking forward to hopefully playing in front of many of them in the Rugby Championship match in September."
