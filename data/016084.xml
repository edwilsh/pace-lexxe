  <title>The 10 most important things in the world right now</title>
  <content>
Hello! Here's what you need to know on Friday.

1. .

9. . PSG wants to activate the Brazilian's €222 million (£198.5 million) buyout clause, but Spanish football officials blocked the transfer - and now the French are threatening legal action.
