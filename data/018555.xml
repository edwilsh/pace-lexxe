Weirdest beliefs of Hollywood stars

Singer Kesha says she has sex with ghosts. "I've got a song called 'Supernatural', that song was about having sex with a ghost," she told Ryan Seacrest. "I lived in this flop house at Rural Canyon and there was this weird energy that lived there, and it used to keep me [up] at night and wake me up. And it progressed into this dark, sexual spirit."

"I am a god," West sings on his new album. "I wrote 'I Am a God'... Cause it's like, 'Yo! Nobody can tell me where I can and can't go'," he told W Magazine. "Man, I'm the number living and breathing rock star. I am Axl Rose; I am Jim Morrison; I am Jimi Hendrix." Tell us how you really feel, Kanye.
