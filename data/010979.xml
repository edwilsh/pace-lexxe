  <title>Sadistic thugs steal scooter keys, force old man to hobble through Rosebud</title>
  <content>
Two sadistic thugs robbed an elderly man riding a mobility scooter in Rosebud - before taking the scooter's keys and forcing the man to hobble to safety.
The 69-year-old man was using his mobility scooter to walk his dog along the chilly Rosebud foreshore about 6.15 Wednesday morning when the pair struck.Photo: ACT Policing
They confronted him near the rear of a local bowling club and demanded his wallet.
The elderly victim told them he was not carrying a wallet, so the offenders pulled him from his scooter and stole his jacket, watch, mobile phone and ring.
As a last insult, they grabbed the scooter's keys and told the old man to walk away, police said.
He eventually made it to a shopping strip nearby and called police, who are now appealing for anyone who might have seen the crime to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
