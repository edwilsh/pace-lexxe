A man is due to appear in court in London charged with raping a 14-year-old girl who was attacked twice in the same night.
Khurram Rahi, 27, is accused of assaulting the teenager in a secluded part of Witton station, near Aston Villa's football ground late last Tuesday.
Afterwards, the girl walked out of the station and flagged down a passing vehicle to ask for help, but was raped a second time after getting into the car with another man.
Rah will appear at Birmingham Magistrates' Court today, British Transport Police said.Detectives are still searching for a suspect in connection with the second attack.
Detective Chief Inspector Tony Fitzpatrick said: "The second assault happened at approximately 2am close to Witton station. The victim flagged down a vehicle for help, a man then raped her."
