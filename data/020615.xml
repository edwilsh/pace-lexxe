  <title>Lion to pounce on more awards glory</title>
  <content>
LION is set to pounce again at the AACTA Awards in December.
Already feted with Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations - and at the Australian box office, where it is the fifth highest grossing local film of all time - the true story of Saroo Brierley's journey from India to Tasmania is now among the 35 films in the running for nominations at the 2017 Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Awards.
AFI/AACTA CEO Damian Trewhella told News Corp Australia that the "very comprehensive" film list - which also includes Dance Academy: The Movie, Jasper Jones, Red Dog: True Blue, Jungle and The LEGO Batman Movie - sweeps up practically every Australian feature released this year, whether via cinema release, local or international festival showing or streaming deal.

This is the result of new eligibility criteria which Trewhella called an "open door policy".
"In the last decade or so, technology has really democratised filmmaking, so there's a whole exciting volume of Australian film coming through. And as this explosion has happened, we have only been able to take a slice of that - due to various resource constraints - until this year," Trewhella said.
In the past, films with a significant cinema release went straight into AACTA contention, while smaller, less visible projects had to first go through a "preselection jury" to make the cut.
"But of course what's happened is the number of people who miss out through preselection has been growing each year and those people have been lobbying harder each year for us to include more films. But we just weren't in a position to accommodate," Trewhella explained.
Films on the 2017 list that may not have made the cut in previous years include David Wenham's debut directorial effort Ellipsis, thus far only shown at the Sydney and Melbourne Film Festivals, and Teresa Palmer thriller 2:22, which had a limited cinema plus VOD release in the US.
The change also comes after last year's AACTA Awards red carpet was crashed by protesters dubbing the event a "sausage party" due to the lack of nominated films driven by female creatives.
"It revealed the strength of passion that people have for the gender issue," Trewhella said of the protest. "They are trying to create necessary change. We think the issue is of great importance.
"We have worked with all of industry, including Screen Australia, to find a way that we could incorporate more films into the program. That has really helped us on inclusivity, on diversity, and it does a lot for new voices and female voices."
This year's batch of eligible films represents a 74 per cent increase in female filmmakers competing across all crafts.
In comparison to 2016, female directors in contention for nominations in 2017 have risen from two to eight, producers from 19 to 35, writers from two to 14, editors from two to seven, sound from eight to 12, composers from four to eight and production designers from seven to 11.
There is also a multicultural mix to the films in competition, including Muslim rom-com Ali's Wedding, Indian story strands and actors in Lion and The Colour Of Darkness, seven languages spoken in One Less God and the filmed in Italy The Space Between Us.
AACTA has also revealed the films nominated for Best Feature Length Documentary at this year's Awards.
Whiteley, the story of Australian artist Brett Whiteley, will vie with Casting JonBenet, David Stratton: A Cinematic Life, Deep Water: The Real Story and indigenous coming of age portrait Zach's Ceremony for the gong.
James Bogle, writer-director of Whiteley, said his team was "delighted" to be nominated.
"There have been many positives in the telling of Brett's story in his own words - this is just the delicious icing on the cake."
Casting JonBenet writer-director Kitty Green said: "I'm incredibly proud of our Australian crew whose passion and dedication helped bring this unique production to life."
All 35 feature films, the Best Documentary nominees and eight short films will screen as part of AACTA's Festival of Australian Film in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney starting later this month.
The screenings are for AFI members, but anyone can join up via
The AACTA Awards nominations will be announced in late October.
