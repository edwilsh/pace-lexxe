  <title>Eels coach puts hold on Parra chatter</title>
  <content>
RUGBY LEAGUE: Parramatta could move into the top four with a win over the Bulldogs on Thursday night but coach Brad Arthur is not ready to discuss finals just yet.
"When we've got enough wins to ensure we're in the finals, I'm happy to talk about it," Arthur said on Wednesday.
"But at the moment we haven't."
The Eels have not played finals football for eight seasons and an impressive 28-14 win over Brisbane last week might have given hope to fans that that drought might be broken this year.
But Arthur said there was still a long way to go before they could plan for the playoffs.
"Finals are the furthest thing from my mind at the moment because we're not guaranteed a finals spot," he said.
"What's really important is that we don't let ourselves down after what we did last weekend.
"We're coming up against a very committed Bulldogs team. They're very good defensively and they'll be tough and playing for their coach."
