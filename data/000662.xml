  <title>Tourists busted climbing crane</title>
  <content>
TWO French tourists will appear in a Cairns court this morning after they were busted allegedly scaling a crane at a construction site while drunk.
City Safe camera operators saw the pair in action about 3am on Saturday and called police who attended the scene at the under-construction Cairns Performing Arts Centre on Sheridan St.
The pair, aged 22 and 26, had reached the boom by the time officers arrived and were asked to descend which they did.
It is alleged the pair had jumped the security fence before making the climb.
They were interviewed by a French-speaking Cairns police officer and charged with one count each of trespass and unregulated high-risk activity.
They are scheduled to appear in Cairns Magistrates Court later this morning.
