  <title>Live NRL 2017 scores: Newcastle Knights v New Zealand Warriors, Gold Coast Titans v Brisbane Broncos, Cronulla Sharks v Canberra Raiders</title>
  <content>
BRISBANE are making light work of life without hooker Andrew McCullough, the Broncos galloping to a 16-0 halftime lead against neighbours Gold Coast.
And Ben Hunt, wearing the number nine but playing off the bench tonight, plucks the ball from dummy-half in the north-eastern corner and throws a dummy before carrying Kane Elgey over the line with him. Jordan Kahu converts. Brisbane 16-0.

Anthony Don tries to get the ball down and opposite Corey Oates picks it up and streaks away. We could have had a double video ref there - grounding at both ends being checked! Alas no as Oates is pulled down. We got back to play the ball where Oates was pulled down. Brisbane 10-0.
Tonga centre Tautau Moga gets a hand free in the tackle at the northern end - actually, both hands judging by the replay - and releases Corey Oates who dots down in the north-western corner for another Broncos try. A near miss by Jordan Kahu. Brisbane 10-0.

Thanks to all the  fans who once again turned out in support..
Im doing fine, just waiting on scans.
HOW GOODS A WIN!
‚ù§üíô

Oates finishes it off but what about the pass from Moga!

Kiwis half Kodi Nikorima throws the king-sized dummy in the north-eastern corner and beats Joe Greenwood before touching down for the opening try of the match. Too quick. The Titans had a try disallowed earlier but it was never actually going to be a try. Jordan Kahu converts. Brisbane 6-0.

Absorb pressure at one end.
Strike at the other! üëè

Kick-off at CBUS Super Stadium. Gold Coast have the ball and they're carting it out of the northern end. Gold Coast 0 Brisbane 0. 

Big  takes a shot from dummy-half.
"I thought we were a lot better than last week - we had some individuals last week who weren't where we needed them to be," said coach Nathan Brown, who added 'we definitely don't want to get the spoon'.
"I'll be death-riding the Tigers."
Brown said he was unsure of the seriousness of fullback Nathan Ross. "We're not sure if it's bone ... he does have some sort of issue," Brown said.
"To see everythign they are practising slowly start to work - and slowly start to work consistently.....
"The second half, they (Warriors) came out really well. When they scord, it was 'game on' again. I thought we controlled them quite well."
On Liam Fitzgibbon, he said: "We'd like to keep Fitzy. We've got an offer in to keep him."WARRIORS coach Stephen Kearney sensationally accused his players of not trying hard enough, lacking effort sand conviction in the big loss to Newcastle, promising consequences as soon as Sunday morning.
The Aucklanders were never really in the race against a Novocastrian side that won consecutive games for the first time since 2015 and Kearney's post game assessment of his players' commitment was the most brutal of any coach in just as long.
"There were some guys out there trying very hard and there were some guys out there that weren't," Kearney said after the 26-10 defeat at McDonald Jones Stadium.
"There were some individuals whose effort was questionable and you can't have that.
"We were our own worst enemies. I don't think we played with enough conviction.
"Sometimes when they've had some habits that are not real good ones, it's tough.
"The idea is that we get some players in there who know that. If I thought wholesale changes would change things out there, I'd have made those changes.
"There are a few scars there that have been there for quite some time. If there are guys who can't get that done, we'll have to get some in who can.
"There are things that have let slip in the last while. That's what happens when you take your eyes off the ball. We'll be addressing that tomorrow."
NEWCASTLE have won back-to-back games for the first time since 2015, cruising to a comfortable home win over the Warriors.

Following last week's win over St George Illawarra, the last-placed Knights took an early 12-0 lead and were never headed against the perennial under-achievers from the City Of Sails.

On negative for the Knights was an injury to fullback Nathan Ross, who walked off despite a reported back fracture.

COMMENT: The win last week against St George Illawarra may prove the most pivotal in the Knights' recent history.

Hear from Brock Lamb following the  win in .

Josh King finds himself in the clear when Sione Matautia puts him through. Brock Lamb is backing up in mid-field and dives over between the posts. The Knights are home. The crowd goes wild. Trent Hodkinson converts from just to the left of the posts. Newcastle 26-10.

Lamb scores and the  fans go wild! üëè

The Bunker gives the thumbs up to a Nathaniel Roache try - no knock-on from Roger Tuivasa-Sheck - and Issac Luke bangs it over from the touchline. Newcastle 20-10.

Vision of the  Try Decision in the 65th minute of .

Chanel Matautia has tripped Mason Lino while tangled up in another tackle. He's on report but stays on the field. I think he got off lightly. Newcastle 20-4.
Brock Lamb pokes his nose through the defence some 25 metres out and passes to Lachlan Fitzgibbon. It looked about as forward as the previous Warriors pass that was called back. Four tries this year for Fitzgibbon. Trent Hodkinson from 19 metres in from touch. He misses. Newcastle 20-4.

Fitzgibbon in space, the  extend their lead! 20-4 with 20 minutes to go.

David Fusitua is over again but it's called back for a forward pass from Roger Tuivasa-Sheck. It looks to have been a very harsh call. Play on if you ask #stupidsaturday Meanwhile there are reports of a back fracture for Nathan Ross. Newcastle 16-4.

All the best

Knights fullback Nathan Ross is down after copping a knock to the nerve. He's in extreme pain and surely must go off. Trainer Tony Ayoub is doing his best to comfort the Ross Dog. He doesn't look like he'll be back today. Newcastle 16-4.

49' Ouch. Break in play as Nathan Ross is down after an accidental knee in the back

Second half underway now. Warriors with first use of the ball, running towards the south. Newcastle 16-4.

It's time for the 2nd Half!

TWO Mitch Barnett tries have helped Newcastle to a commanding halftime lead over the Warriors, whom they appear to be slowly wearing down at McDonald Jones Stadium.

Lock Mitch Barnett scored two tries in the opening 10 minutes to set up a 10-0 lead, with winger David Fusitua pegging them back slightly before two Trent Hodkinson penalty goals just short of the break widened the margin. A win would be the Knights' third of the year.
COMMENT: Last week's win over St George Illawarra may prove to be a belated turning point for the Novocastrian.

Hear from Dane Gagai at HT of .

Knights up after the first 40 in Newcastle
üì∏

And another goal from Hodkinson from not too far out. The Knights edge a little further ahead. Death by a thousand cuts for the Warriors. Newcastle 16-4.
Newcastle pressuring the Warriors line and the Aucklanders are just holding on. Another penalty for delaying tactics in the ruck. Hodkinson with the goal shot from just to the left of the posts Newcastle 14-4.

32 | Action-packed set there! We get possession, credit to Daniel Saifiti for the chase on Tuivasa-Sheck  ...
