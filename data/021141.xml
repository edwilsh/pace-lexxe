  <title>Eleven churchgoers shot dead as local feud turns into bloodbath</title>

Nigeria:  - Gunmen killed 11 people and wounded 18 others in a church in south-eastern Nigeria on Sunday in an attack arising from a feud between members of the local community, officials said.
However, police believe that a man the gunmen were hunting for was not present in the church and so escaped the attack.Photo: Supplied
The attackers struck the church in Ozubulu early in the morning, said Garba Umar, head of police in Anambra state.
They were believed to have been trying to kill a local man, who was not identified by the authorities.

"The gunmen came thinking that their target was in the church but incidentally he was not," Umar said, adding that the violence may be linked to drug-trafficking.
No arrests have been made, he said.

Nigeria's south-east is predominantly Christian and the attack is a rare act of violence at a church.

"We are not going to relent until we bring those that perpetrated this heinous crime to book," he said.

Ethnically-charged violence is common throughout the central states and militancy is a constant threat in the oil-rich south-east.
