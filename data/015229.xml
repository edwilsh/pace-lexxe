  <title>De Vanna: 'Six goals ... was a dedication to Les'</title>
  <content>
MATILDAS record-breaker Lisa De Vanna has revealed fallen Australian soccer legend Les Murray was an inspiration behind their 6-1 rout of Brazil.
The Australian women's soccer team claimed a first trophy in seven years by winning the Tournament of Nations in Carson, USA.
And they did so with black armbands on their sleeve for Murray.
The universally-popular broadcaster died on Monday after a battle with illness.
He will be honoured by the New South Wales government with a state funeral, but on Friday (AEST), the Matildas paid a stunning tribute of their own.
De Vanna -- who scored two first-half goals in the win -- said the Matildas ran out with Murray in their hearts after a pre-match rallying call from coach Alen Stajcic.
"Today was emotional,' De Vanna told AAP.

Football: Re-live all six goals scored by the Matildas in their Cup Of Nations match against Brazil.

"Staj usually puts different things in team meetings and today it was all about Les.
"You could tell in Staj's voice how much he and (fellow SBS commentator) Johnny Warren meant to him and the game.
"For obviously Polks (Clare Polkinghorne) and Lydia (Williams) who are senior players, we obviously knew all about his legacy and what this man fought for.
"Just like we are fighting to be the best team, to be recognised and to lift the game and the women's game in Australia.

Football: Caitlin Foord has scored for the Matildas on the counter attack to give them a 2-1 lead over Brazil.

"Les was a pioneer. Staj laid out how he was like us women, fighting to show what we can do. And for Australia.
"A lot of the girls took that advice onto the field and it showed.
"To go out and score six goals, it was a bit of a dedication to Les."
De Vanna -- who overtook Kate Gill to become the Matildas all-time leading goalscorer with her brace -- helped lead celebrations.

Football: Katrina Gorry has scored the fourth goal for Australia against Brazil.

"Everyone's so happy," she said.
On a personal note, she said she was overflowing with pride to have become the country's leading goalscorer.
"Everyone knows how much playing for my country means to me," she said. "Scoring those two goals was everything because I've given so much to the game. "To have something like this to look back on is fantastic."

Congratulations to  - inaugural Tournament of Nations champions! 6-1 against Brazil, what a triumph
