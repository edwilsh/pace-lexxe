The move to legalise gay marriage in Australia is gaining momentum and likely to happen before the end of the year, with another government MP signalling he is willing to cross the floor to support change, and a Liberal senator warning failure to recognise marriage equality would be "political suicide." 
On Monday, the federal Liberal MP for Brisbane Trevor Evans said he supported a free vote. His comments are being interpreted by supporters of gay marriage as a coded signal that he would be willing to cross the floor to help bring on a vote and force the issue to be dealt with by Parliament. 
Mr Evans - who is openly gay - told News Corp the Coalition should dump its policy to hold a plebiscite on the issue given it has been rejected by Labor and the Greens in the Senate.
"I think the quickest and most likely course now is to allow politicians to have a free vote ... and I support that," he said.
"I am talking with colleagues, quite a number of colleagues, about different options that sit in front of us at the moment."
Liberal senator Dean Smith, who is also openly gay, is drafting a bill to legalise same-sex marriage. Writing for the Australian Financial Review, he urged his colleagues to vote in Parliament by Christmas.
"The government should not feel obligated to commit political suicide by handing its opponents a massive political cudgel by allowing the question of marriage equality to remain unresolved and fester over the next two years," he wrote.

"Far too much time and energy has already been consumed by this debate. It is time to resolve the matter, in Parliament, as our constitution provides.
"Australian voters are perplexed about why so much time and energy is being expended on an issue where the community attitude is now crystal clear and why the government would continue to harm itself by delaying a free vote."
In a separate piece for The Australian, Senator Smith cites former prime minister Tony Abbott - an opponent of change - as saying the 2015 pledge to hold a plebiscite would be the last binding vote on the Coalition party room. 
With the plebiscite blocked by the Senate, supporters now argue they are free to vote according to their conscience if a private members' bill is put to the Parliament instead. 
An absolute majority of 76 is required to bring on a vote in the House of Representatives. That means the Labor Party would need four Liberal MPs to cross the floor to succeed in interrupting the scheduled business of Parliament to bring forward the private members' bill. 
Liberal MPs Mr Evans, Warren Entsch, Tim Wilson and Trent Zimmerman are all likely candidates to cross the floor. The government does not hold a majority in the Senate. 

The push to force a free vote would cause a major dispute within the Coalition party room and potentially threaten Malcolm Turnbull's prime ministership. Mr Turnbull supports gay marriage and a free vote but agreed to continue the policy to hold a plebiscite as part of his deal to take over the prime ministership from Mr Abbott.
