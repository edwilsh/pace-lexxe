  <title>NextDC dials up data centres bid</title>
  <content>
Data storage operator NextDC has sweetened its offer for Asia Pacific Data Centres, hoping a knockout bid will end a rival proposal from property fund manager 360 Capital.
The tussle for control of the boutique facilities fund took another turn on Monday when its sole tenant, NextDC, lifted its existing cash offer - at $1.85¢ per share - to $1.87¢
As well, NextDC, led by Craig Scroggie, has dropped its previous acceptance threshold of just above 50 per cent, making its latest offer unconditional.
The latest offer values APDC at a little above $215 million. It closed 4¢ higher at $1.88 on Monday.

"We believe that we are the logical owner of the APDC data centres in the current circumstances," NextDC chief executive Mr Scroggie said.

"Consistent with our strategy since 2015, we intend to own a greater proportion of the properties we operate".
The bidding war for APDC began in earnest last week, when  That came just one day after the property trust received a rival buyout proposal from 360 Capital.
The battle for control  for several weeks after 360 Capital, led by Tony Pitt, and take over running the fund.
Mr Pitt then , flagging a $1.80 proposal to buy out investors in the trust last week as well.

360 Capitalbut its request for a board seat was quickly turned down and Mr Pitt began campaigning to dump the management.
Mr Pitt has said he is committed to doing due diligence after the APDC granted access, and reaffirmed that position on Monday.
"We note the NextDC price is not expressed to be final and therefore NextDC is capable of increasing the offer price," 360 Capital said in a company statement..
"The assets within the Asia Pacific Data Centres portfolio are very strategic and are attractive not only to NextDC, but also other global data centre operators and data centre investors.

On its side, the APDC board urged investors to "take no action" given the NextDC offer remains open for a month and there is a "potential although no certainty" a superior offer could emerge.
