  <title>Glorious sunshine as we start August</title>
  <content>
WARMER weather is in sight with Melbourne experiencing some glorious sunshine as it welcomed the month of August.
The mostly sunny day yesterday, which reached a top of 15C, had Melburnians out and about catching the warm rays. Today is predicted to reach a top of 16C despite light winds and a few clouds. The remainder of the week is also looking brighter with average temperatures of about 15C but showers forecast for the weekend.
Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Dean Stewart said August was expected to be a drier month than usual. "There is an increased chance of below average rainfall across the state for August," he said.
