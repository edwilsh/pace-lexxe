Conor McGregor's challenge
1:04

Conor McGregor may be one of the hardest punchers in the UFC and MMA but switching to boxing to fight the undefeated Floyd 'Money' Mayweather will present the biggest challenge of his career, with the two sports being more different than meets the eye.

CONOR McGregor has opened up on the controversial sparring session with Paulie Malignaggi and insisted the former boxer "got his ass whooped".
A photo was shared on social media platforms that showed Malignaggi on the canvas during the training camp, with McGregor standing over him.
But Malignaggi insisted it was as a result of a push, and hit out at McGregor's camp for "painting a picture that wasn't true".
He then quit the camp and sent out a statement criticising how the whole event was managed.
But speaking on Showtime's All Access, McGregor was adamant there was only one aggressor when the two sparred.
The Notorious said: "He stayed in there - you've got to give him respect for that.
"But that was it - he came, he got his a** whooped and that was it."
McGregor went on to explain why he brought former welterweight world champ Malignaggi in for the training sessions.
He added: "I was just watching this guy speak, like 'who the f*** is he?'.

"I looked at his stance, looked at his approach. There are some similarities to Floyd.
"I don't really give a f*ck if there were similarities or not.

"He was speaking a hell of a game. I said, 'bring this boy in here and let's fight!'"
Malignaggi at first was very complimentary of the Irish MMA star turned boxer, saying that the UFC lightweight champion had good power.
But after one too many photos of the sparring sessions were leaked online, Malignaggi feels enough is enough and he has demanded that McGregor releases the sparring session video.
Writing on Twitter, the retired Brooklyn boxer said: "Its not nice to paint a picture that isn't true.
"This was a pushdown in sparring, post the whole video rounds 1 through 12 unedited".
"I came to help this camp out, not to be exploited, now your gonna get the truth though. Post full unedited video from Tuesday night.
