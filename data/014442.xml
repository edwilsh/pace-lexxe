  <content>
The Apocalypse's cancellation will have to wait, as Pacific Rim Uprising gets delayed. The live action Lion King may be close to finding its Scar. Who is the Barb of Stranger Things season two? Plus, Samuel L. Jackson on Glass, another new look at Deadpool 2's Domino, and a bevy of new Game of Thrones pictures. Spoilers get!

Captain Marvel

A wild new report from  claims that, , much of Carol Danvers' original origin story will make it into the new movie.

The site alleges that not only will Carol start out as Ms. Marvel, complete with a version of her original comic book costume, she will also still get her powers from the explosion of a Kree device called the Psyche-Magnetron. Perhaps most perplexing of all, the site also states that Mar-Vell - the Kree warrior who was both the original Captain Marvel and Carol's love interest - will indeed appear in the film. For now, take all this with a heavy pinch of salt.

The Lion King

Be prepared! Chiwetel Ejiofor is in talks to play Scar in a live-action remake of The Lion King. []

Christopher Robin

reports that Hayley Atwell has joined the cast as Christopher Robin's currently unnamed wife.

Han Solo

Howard (Ron, not Clint) also shared this set pic of a new R2 unit on Twitter.

Billion Brick Race

The Book of Life's Jorge Gutierrez has been tapped to direct a new Lego movie. Details are currently scarce beyond the title, but judging by it, expect a race - and hijinks to ensue from it, naturally. []

Blood Fest

Spider-Man: Homecoming's Jacob Batalon will star in an upcoming meta-horror/comedy about a group of teenage genre fans thrown into various supernatural predicaments at a haunted film festival. []

Ant-Man & The Wasp

has uncovered a new casting call searching for "Asian-looking school kids".

Deadpool 2

Zazie Beetz has shared another new image of her take on Domino:

In related news, director David Leitch discussed how he plans to depict Domino's unique mutant ability to manipulate probability in a conversation with .

Lastly, the infamous  has set pics of Deadpool tethered to a parachute.

Glass

Speaking with , Samuel L. Jackson revealed filming on the Unbreakable/Split follow-up begins next month:

Pacific Rim: Uprising

The sequel has been pushed back one month. It now reaches theatres March 23rd instead of February. []

It

Another new TV spot still refuses to let Pennywise speak.

My Little Pony: The Movie

Here's a sneak peek at one of the film's musical numbers.

Ascendant

The final chapter in the Divergent saga is set to become a TV series at Starz, according to .

Stranger Things

Shawn Levy revealed at San Diego Comic Con that Sean Astin's character, Bob, is "the Barb" of season two.

Please look forward to all future seasons of Stranger Things having their own Barb. []

The Flash

Speaking at the TCA 2017 summer press tour, CW president Mark Pedowitz mercifully confirmed the series is done with Speedster villains, at least for the forseeable future:

Thank god. []

Game of Thrones

Images from this week's episode, "Spoils of War" seem to depict the long-awaited meeting between Jon Snow and Theon Greyjoy. Just as with the Daenerys/Jon pics from last week, the two are never in the frame together, but the locations appear the same. Head over to  to see the rest.
