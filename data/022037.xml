  <title>Vic company fined over truckie's death</title>
  <content>
A Victorian towing company has been fined $275,000 for safety breaches that led to a truck driver's death.
The truck driver died in hospital after he was struck by a van while loading a crane onto a truck in August 2015.
JMAL Group Pty Ltd, of Sunshine North, was fined $275,000 and convicted of failing to provide a safe system of work after WorkSafe found there were no measures in place to warn motorists of the crane being loaded onto the trailer.
