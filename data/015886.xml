  <title>Coffee company seeks to return more profit to PNG growers</title>
  <content>
Coffee is big business for Papua New Guinea, but one man thinks growers should be sharing in more of the retail profits of their product.
Pana Wiya grew up farming coffee in the highlands but now lives in Sydney, where he's set up the business Village Coffee in the hope he can return more money to fellow farmers.
Coffee growers can expect to earn between two to five percent of the retail price of their coffee, but Mr Wiya says it should be more like 35 percent.
He's importing coffee directly from PNG farmers via co-operatives, then roasting it and selling it to customers online.
By reducing profit margins and cutting out the middlemen of marketing firms and distributors, Mr Wiya believes he could make the country's coffee farming more sustainable and secure while keeping retail prices competitive.
But he says he needs government funding from either PNG or Australia to be able to make that happen.
