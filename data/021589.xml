  <title>Gold Coast records second highest sale this week in Queensland - realestate.com.au</title>
  <content>
A SOVEREIGN Islands mansion sold under the hammer on the weekend for a cool $2.181 million.
It was the second highest sale in Queensland this week according to CoreLogic.
The property at was on the market with sales agent Jeff Sturgess of Amir Mian Prestige Property Agents.
"We had good strong bidding with three registered bidders," Mr Sturgess said.
"The auction started at $1.95 million and we had some strong bids through to $2.18 million and then finished it off.
"The buyer has originally come up from South Australia."
The five-bedroom house is on a 875sq m block with 18m of water frontage.
A cinema, bar, Bali hut and pool are among the property's feature.
There is also a 10m pontoon fitted with electricity and water.
Mr Sturgess said there was plenty of buyer interest in properties on the Sovereign Islands.
"Land prices certainly have increased and I think that's starting to have a positive impact on established homes here as well."
