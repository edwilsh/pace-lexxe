Topics: B.O. the mother of (some) invention

INVENTORS WANTED: The Anti-Sweat Suit, Tea-Jiggler and Proper-Chopper are part of a CSIRO recruitment campaign.

exit

IF you, like Topics, reckon the "Anti-Sweat Suit" (pictured) sounds like a great idea and are already wondering how to order one for that certain someone in the office or your mid-week indoor cricket team, but discreetly, you're probably not the target audience for the CSIRO's undergraduate vacation scholarship drive.
The point is, they want people to invent something better. The Do Better campaign also spawned a "Tea-Jiggler" on the end of a robotic arm (genius!) and a knife and board contraption called "The Proper-Chopper" (seriously, how is that not already a thing?).
The posters are being put up around the University of Newcastle to lure our brightest young minds to the csiro.au/dobetter website, where they'll find "better" inventions like gluten-free beer (sigh, how will we convey to our grandchildren the gluten wars?), the lab on a glove (surely no match for pizza in a cone) and energy efficient buildings (yeah, OK).
Applications for the scholarship close on Monday. If you're not sure whether to apply remember, Thomas Edison whipped up the phonograph, the light bulb, the battery and the motion picture. You'll probably only have to come up with one.
CHRONICLES OF LJUBO: PART 2
NOW where were we? Former Jets free spirit Ljubo Milicevic had just revealed his game day preparation of getting a tattoo in Japan (Topics, August 2) and... ah yes: chapter two, the mystery Melbourne night out.
"[Adelaide United defender] Taylor [Regan] threw this collection at me," notes Ljubo of some photos on Instagram.
"[Former Jets] Kew Jaliens and Emile [Heskey] said 'Reegs, we wanna have a night out in Melbourne, what should we do ya reckon?'"
Regan, reportedly: "I'll get my mate Ljubo to organise something for yas, enjoy the night".
The next morning, the bleary-eyed Dutchman and Englishman: "Your mate Ljubo is a f---ing lunatic".
So what happened that night? The mind boggles.
BRIAN DINES ON BREAD AND BUTTER
AFTER a string of union attack ads against Hunter One Nation Senator Brian Burston, it's reassuring to see the "gentleman of One Nation" get back to basics on social media.
On Wednesday afternoon, Senator Burston posted a meme on his Facebook page of a praying man silhouetted across minarets. And we quote [all sic]:
"Labors Ed Husic is Muslim. Labors Ann Aly is Muslim. Labors Jihad Dib is Muslim. Labors Sam Dastyari is Muslim. Greens Mehreen Faruqi is Muslim. 
There were no Muslims in govt at the start of 2010! Awake yet?"
Put the whistle down, Senator - Topics gets your drift! Those are five new public sector jobs, is what he's saying, from an under-represented demographic. 
Always fighting for the little guy.
MYSTERY IN THE MUD

CLEAR AS MUD: The mystery car beside the lake at Speers Point on Tuesday.
TOPICS doesn't want to alarm anyone, or pretend we know anything, but this whole, entire car (pictured) was at Speers Point on Tuesday after taking an apparent dip in Lake Macquarie.
If you know how it got there, or what happened next, please yell out. Car wash attendants, we're talking to you here.
MISSING MURRAY'S MAYHEM

VOICE OF THE GRID: Murray Walker salutes the Australian Grand Prix crowd in 2001.
TO the pantheon of sports broadcasters who we'll probably never replicate (Topics, August 2), Lake Macquarie Labor councillor Barney Langford makes a strong case for the former voice of Formula One, Murray Walker.
Muz is now 93 and we haven't heard him call a Grand Prix since 2001, if you can believe that.
"Unless I'm very much mistaken... I AM very much mistaken!" 

Indeed, Muz. We've all felt like that.
