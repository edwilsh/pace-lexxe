  <title>Victoria bids for $5 billion contract to build high-tech military vehicles to create 2,000 jobs</title>
  <content>
The Victorian Government says it hopes to create 2,000 jobs by teaming up with a major defence manufacturer to bid for a $5 billion contract to build high-tech military vehicles in Melbourne.
Defence giant BAE Systems hopes to build 225 vehicles at the former Holden site at Fishermans Bend, in inner Melbourne, if it wins the contract.
The Federal Government is expected to decide early next year whether the tender goes to BAE, or the German-owned Rheinmetall Defence, which would build the armed vehicles in Queensland.
Victoria's Industry and Employment Minister Wade Noonan said the contract could help those who have lost their jobs in the car manufacturing sector.
"Victoria does have a long and proud history of manufacturing," he said.
"There are thousands of workers who have dedicated their careers to building, or have built cars for the Australian industry, and these workers could now play a really critical role in building a new generation of armoured vehicles to protect Australian troops.
"This puts Victoria firmly in the race to be the home of military vehicle building."
Mr Noonan said the Government would develop the site at Fishermans Bend to make way for an assembly plant if BAE Systems won the contract.
Other Victorian parts manufacturing businesses also stood to gain, he said.
"We see this as a really terrific opportunity to create an ecosystem of international companies who really are forward-looking in terms of what  they can create," he said.
"The close proximity to both the CBD and the port makes Fishermans Bend a very attractive proposition.
"And with supply chain businesses, the value of this project will be carried across Victoria from Geelong to Moorabbin where many of those supply chain companies operate."
Mr Noonan confirmed the Government had financially backed BAE's bid for the multi-billion dollar contract, but would not release a figure, citing commercial confidentiality.
The bids need to be submitted to the Federal Government by August 11.
