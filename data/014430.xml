  <title>Truck explodes next to Brisbane M1 at Loganholme, shaking homes nearby</title>
  <content>
A truck carrying chemicals has exploded and burst into flames near the M1 at Loganholme, south of Brisbane, with police declaring an emergency situation covering a 1-kilometre radius of the crash site.
Police said the tanker was on Bryants Road near the southbound exit of the motorway, opposite the Logan Hyperdome.
Authorities are advising nearby businesses to evacuate and emergency crews are at the scene.
Paramedics are yet to confirm any injuries.
The Logan Hyperdome remains open, but the Officeworks building on Bryants Road beside the M1 has been evacuated. 
Residents have told the ABC they heard at least half a dozen explosions.

ABC reporter Francis Tapim, who lives nearby, said he felt the explosion.
"I got up and there was about five or six explosions that literally just shook my house, my little brick house," he said.
"No-one is getting through [on the M1] and I feel sorry for the people who are stuck behind this accident at the moment because they can't get off the freeway - they're going to be there for hours.
"It was a bad explosion - I was sleeping at home.
"These explosions are so loud that it shook my house, it rocked the house and I thought 'hang on, that can't be a jackhammer'."
Police said the southbound lanes of the M1 are closed, with traffic being diverted off at the Bryant Road exit.
The northbound lanes may also be required for emergency services, so drivers can expect delays.
Police said people in the immediate vicinity should to stay indoors, and anyone with breathing difficulties to keep medication of breathing aids with them.
More to come.
