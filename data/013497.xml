  <title>'Wear blue to honour Justine's life'</title>
  <content>
THE family of Justine Ruszczyk Damond has released details of the public memorial service scheduled for Friday, August 11th at 6:00pm (local time) at the Lake Harriet Band Shell in Minneapolis.
Damond, who moved to Minneapolis in 2015 to be with her fiance, was killed just before midnight on July 15 by police officer Mohamed Noor.
The incident is still shrouded in mystery because the investigating agency, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, has released few details and it was not captured on camera.
The event will include remarks from her fiance Don Damond, her father John Ruszczyk and other friends and family of the 40-year-old life coach.
The memorial service will also include music by Minnesota pianist Steven C. Anderson and a multimedia presentation celebrating Damond's life.
Mourners are asked to honour Damond by wearing blue, one of her signature colours, and will also have an opportunity to write a special message about how her life touched the world.
Family spokesman Tom Hyderthat her fiance wanted the picturesque outdoor location, believing it would be a fitting venue.
Damond was born in 1977 and grew up in Sydney's North Beaches. As a spiritual healer and meditation coach, Damond focused her life on healing others.
She planned to wed her fiance in August 2017.
