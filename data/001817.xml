ILLAWARRA young-gun Jai Field came up big  not once, but twice, in a crucial win for the Steelers on Saturday.
The defending Intrust Super Premiership champions risked dropping out of the finals equation had they lost the match to Newcastle, who overcame a 24-6 halftime deficit to lead by six late in the clash.
Field managed to convert Jordan Pereira's 75th minute from out wide to level up at 32-all before also landing the match-winning penalty goal on fulltime. 

"It was definitely a really gutsy win," Field said.

"The stats didn't really show our way at all, we finished 60-40 per cent [possession] down.

"We made over a hundred more tackles than them so for us to stay in it and still be there at the end to have a shot at that goal was really good.

"To kick that winning goal was awesome. It was a relief more than anything. It keeps us up in the eight and we've got a few players coming back after the bye so hopefully we can kick on now.
