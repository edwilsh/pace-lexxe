  <title>Northern Beaches Council spends $320k on new 'identity' including logo and website</title>

Northern Beaches Council logo rolled out on trucks.
A  NEW "identity" created for Northern Beaches Council, which included a logo and a new website, has cost taxpayers $320,000.
The "identity" launched last week saw $46,980 put towards a new logo and another $273,000 spent on consultation with more than 2000 residents on its design.

The council's chief executive officer Mark Ferguson said the development of a new website was also part of the total costs.

The costs so far do not include the rollout of the logo on to council-owned assets, which will be taken from this year's budget.
The new "identity" was revealed at last week's council meeting to positive feedback from the public gallery.
The project, a requirement set out by the State Government as part of the merger project, has been criticised as a waste of money by some.

Former Manly councillor Hugh Burns said the funds could have been used elsewhere.
"They are fairly high costs relating directly to amalgamation," Mr Burns said.
"It is money down the drain that could have been spent on community projects, we could have an arts centre, more sculptures, roads repaired, $300,000 is an awful lot of money."

It was paid for as part of the $10 million merger bonus from the State Government.

The costs were defended by Mr Ferguson who said the creation of a new identity was an important process for staff and the community.
"This investment has allowed us to work in partnership with the community to create something that truly reflects the spirit of the community, inspires future success for the council and paves the way for a great customer experience, " he said.
"We didn't have an identity as a new council," he said.
"It was necessary to have something that was a reflection of the Northern Beaches Council looking to the future and having it based on a strong level of community participation."

He also pointed out the costs involved in the design of the logo on the council's more than 150 sites and -services.
A presentation delivered at the last council meeting described it as "a diverse collection of flora and fauna and man-made elements synonymous with the northern beaches combined ... to create an iconic water cres logo".
The logo includes a humpback whale, Norfolk pine, pelican, sailing and weedy seadragon.

It was a product of multiple community consultation sessions and feedback from former councillors across Manly, Warringah and Pittwater.
"We need to have one consistent brand for the northern beaches council at the moment you have a range of different identities that exist form the three former councils," Mr Ferguson said.
He argued the new identity was important for council staff to take pride in their workplace.
