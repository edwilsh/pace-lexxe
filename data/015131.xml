  <title>Traffic banking after two-car motorway smash</title>
  <content>
BREAKING: One lane is closed and traffic is banking up behind two badly damaged vehicles after a Sunshine Mwy smash.
Witnesses at the scene said the black Subaru Liberty had a flat tyre and pulled over on the side of the motorway, just north of the Maroochydore interchange.
As the driver waited for assistance, a white Hyundai i30 approached on the motorway, lost control and slammed into the Subaru.
The i30 continued for about another 30m down the motorway, knocking down the barrier before it came to a stop.
The right hand lane of the motorway is closed, with traffic controllers on scene to direct motorists.
Ambulance crews are also on scene, and confirmed nobody was injured in the crash.
