Cessnock Hospital

Police were called to Cessnock Hospital on Monday night after reports of a bomb threat.
Officers were forced to inspect the hospital grounds after a phone call was made by a woman who "made comments amounting to a bomb threat" about 7.30pm.

Under operational protocols, staff called police who attended and cleared the premises of any threat. 

The incident came after staff received a call from someone on the same phone number minutes earlier demanding details about a patient.
The request was refused due to confidentiality reasons. The staff member told police the caller became "irate and abusive" before she hung up.

Police inquires continue into the matter.
