  <title>Donald Trump's lawyer vows full cooperation as Robert Mueller convenes grand jury in Russia probe</title>
  <content>
The investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election has taken a serious step - special counsel Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington.

Key points:

Grand jury will consider charges and give Mr Mueller powerful new investigative tools
White House lawyer says "no reason" to think Donald Trump is under investigation
US senators take steps to stop Mr Trump from firing Mr Mueller

Grand jury subpoenas have been issued in connection with a , two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
White House special counsel Ty Cobb, who is in charge of managing matters related to the Russia investigation, said he was not aware that Mr Mueller had started using the grand jury, but vowed full cooperation.
"The White House favours anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly," he said.
Mr Cobb added that there was "no reason" to believe President Donald Trump was under investigation.
What does a grand jury actually do?

It's a group of ordinary citizens who, working behind closed doors, considers evidence and potential criminal wrongdoing that a prosecutor is investigating.
They then decide whether charges should be brought.
It means that the probe has gone beyond investigating what might have happened, to potentially charging people with crimes, .
It also gives Mr Mueller some expansive new tools to pursue evidence he might not have otherwise been able to get.
That includes issuing subpoenas and compelling witnesses to testify.
It also just got harder for Trump to fire Mr Mueller

US senators have introduced two bipartisan bills aimed at protecting him.
The similar measures emerged hours before the Senate was planning to begin a summer recess, when some senators have said they fear Mr Trump might remove Mr Mueller.
Senators have warned Mr Trump not to dismiss Mr Mueller, and they were hoping the bills' release would communicate clear congressional opposition to such a move.
One of the plans plan would let any special counsel for the Department of Justice challenge his or her removal in court. A three-judge panel would review the dismissal within 14 days of the challenge.
The measure would apply retroactively to this past May 17 - the day Mr Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein to investigate allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible ties between Russia and Mr Trump's presidential campaign.
The other legislation would prevent the firing of any special counsel unless the dismissal was first reviewed by a panel of three federal judges.
But Trump could 'take some abrupt action'

Democratic Senator Chris Coons said Mr Muller enjoyed wide support from both parties.
He said the bills reflected "our level of concern that the president may take some abrupt action in coming months" against the special counsel and the investigation.
Russia has loomed large over the first six months of the Trump presidency, with US congressional panels also investigating the Russian election interference that intelligence agencies believe was meant to tilt the vote in Mr Trump's favour.
Moscow denies any meddling and Mr Trump denies any collusion by his campaign, while regularly denouncing the investigations as political witch hunts.
