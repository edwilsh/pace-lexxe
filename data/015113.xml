FURTHER HONOUR: Kezie Apps has been named in the Jillaroos Merit Team
HELENSBURGH pair Kezie Apps and Sam Bremner have capped a second straight interstate crown for NSW with selection in the inaugural Australian Jillaroos Merit Team.

The initiative mirrors that of Kangaroos coach Mal Meninga who named his own merit side at the conclusion of this year's State of Origin side.

The line-up named by Jillaroos coach Brad Donald, which also included former Helensburgh Tigerlillies Ruan Sims and Maddie Studdon, features 12 NSW players and five Queenslanders.
"We're fortunate to have an incredibly talented and committed playing group at the elite level of the women's game and at a time when women's pathways in rugby league has never been stronger," Donald said.

"Those in this merit team not only deserve to be named due to their on-field performance, but every one of them has gone above and beyond to embrace new audiences, fans and participants in the lead up to the Interstate Challenge."
