  <title>Suva coach proud of gutsy effort after top dogs Nadroga are toppled</title>
  <content>
It's been four years since there was a changing of the guard in Fiji rugby's Farebrother Challenge, so the new holders of the trophy are revelling in the moment.
After a run of 25 undefeated matches stretching back to 2013, it was Suva who finally managed to topple Nadroga at the weekend, despite being a man short for most of the game.
The defending champions looked to be hanging on for a 26th successful challenge, until Suva summoned the energy to score a late try, and grab the game by single point, 24-23.
Coach Saiasi Fuli says he is very proud of his players for finding the will to win against the odds.
