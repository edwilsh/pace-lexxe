  <title>RSPCA removes 21 cats from Vic house</title>
  <content>
RSPCA inspectors have seized 21 cats from a house in Victoria that were at immediate risk.
Inspectors obtained a court order to remove the cats from the Murrindindi property on Tuesday following an earlier inspection.
"We concluded that the living conditions were detrimental to the cats' welfare which was seriously compromised," inspector Guy Gorman said in statement.
The cats were taken to an RSPCA facility where they are being treated for cat flu and fleas.
The RSPCA declined to comment further as the investigation is ongoing.
