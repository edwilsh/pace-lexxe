  <title>Vic man, 29, jailed over online sex show</title>
  <content>
A Victorian man who arranged for an 11-year-old Filipino girl and her mother to have sex so he could watch online has been jailed for three years.
Steven Koscak, 29, also had sexual conversations with underage Australian girls online and asked them to send him explicit photos before he was caught by an undercover police officer posing as a child.
"You engaged in the ever-growing sexual exploitation of children," Victorian County Court Judge Mark Dean said as he sentenced Koscak on Friday.
