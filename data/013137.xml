  <title>Cardinal Pell spotted strolling in Sydney</title>
  <content>
Embattled Cardinal George Pell has been spotted walking through Sydney CBD a week after his first appearance in a Melbourne court.
The former Sydney and Melbourne archbishop and Ballarat priest has taken leave from his position as Vatican treasurer to return to Australia to fight multiple historical sex offence charges in Victoria.
Pell was spotted walking north on Philip Street in Sydney by an AAP photographer on Thursday morning.
He was walking near St Mary's Cathedral - the seat of Sydney's archbishop which is a position Pell once occupied.
Current Archbishop Anthony Fisher in June revealed the archdiocese would help provide accommodation and support for Pell but would not pay his legal fees.
Pell appeared in Melbourne Magistrate's Court for the first time on July 26 when his barrister made it clear he intended to plead not guilty to all charges.
He is next scheduled to appear before the court on October 6.
