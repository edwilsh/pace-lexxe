  <title>Talented young tennis players offered college scholarships</title>
  <content>
TENNIS: A selection of Sunshine Coast talents have been offered scholarships to play division one college tennis in the United States.
Somer Dalla-Bona, Tayah Cross and Chloe Purkiss have been recognised as promising players from the high performance program at KT Academy, Mooloolaba Tennis Club.
Academy director Adon Kronk said he was "extremely proud of all three girls and knows from experience that they will come back with a lifetime experience that money can't buy."
Dalla-Bona, who is amid Australia's top-80 players, has received a full scholarship at the University of Coastal Carolina.
The Mountain Creek High product was a finalist in the Toowoomba Easter Gold Cup earlier this year.
Cross, who was a quarter finalist in the same event, has received a full Scholarship to North Carolina University.
The Matthew Flinders Anglican College product is ranked within Australia's top-200.
Purkiss, a Mountain Creek High student, is on the comeback trail from an injury-riddled couple of years and is talks with multiple schools who have offered scholarship.
Partnered with Study and Play USA, KT Academy's goal for players is to excel on the court and off the court.
