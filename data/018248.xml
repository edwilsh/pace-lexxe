Hoping to have a shot , this little boy decided to take his chances and wrote to NASA, the  reported.
He doesn't think his age should be an obstacle.
"I may be nine, but I think I would be fit for the job. One of the reasons is my sister says I am an alien also, I have seen almost all the space and alien movies I can see," he wrote.
"I have also seen the show Marvel Agents of Shield and hope to see the movie Men in Black. I am great at video games. I am young, so I can learn to think like an Alien."
Sure, he may lack some of the more technical skills the six-figure-salary job requires but Jack has seen a lot of space movies and is as keen as can be.
