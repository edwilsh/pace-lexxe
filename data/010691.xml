WORK-life balance isn't a level playing field for Yvonne Sampson.
Despite getting engaged to Channel 9 news reporter Chris O'Keefe in April, the Fox League presenter said she had pushed back her wedding to fit around her work commitments.
"I've put it off until the end of next year. Unfortunately my wedding plans have to revolve around the NRL season," Sampson told The Courier-Mail at the launch of Fox League's Retro Round on Tuesday.
It is easy to understand Sampson's passion for her job, becoming the face of Fox Sports' rugby league coverage this year after being poached from Channel 9 on a multi-year deal in December.
"It was a difficult decision to make and there was a few tears along the way," Sampson, 36, said. "But I love it; being part of Fox League is new and fresh."

Particularly invigorating for the veteran sports presenter was helming the first all female NRL panel show, League Life, with Lara Pitt, Jess Yates and Hannah Hollis.
While Sampson said she had been "blown away" by the response, she admitted she was hesitant when Fox Sports bosses initially pitched the idea.
"We weren't sure how rugby league fans would take an all-female show," she said.
"It's been a wonderful surprise. We love coming together on a Wednesday and it's nice to have like-minded women around to help out in a professional sense."

Fox League's Retro Round, which remembers rugby league in the 1980s, will continue across Round 22.
