  <content>
A two-year-old Adelaide girl is in a critical condition after contracting meningococcal disease.
SA Health says nine people who have been in close contact with the toddler are receiving precautionary antibiotics.
The strain of the disease is yet to be determined.
There have been 21 cases of meningococcal disease in South Australia so far this year, compared to 13 at the same time last year.
