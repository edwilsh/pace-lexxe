  <title>Gay divorce ban breaches human rights: UN</title>
  <content>
Australian laws stopping same-sex couples who married overseas from getting divorced violate international human rights obligations, the United Nations has found.
In a decision released overnight, the UN Human Rights Committee ruled an Australian woman has been denied equal protection of the law because Australia does not allow her to end a legal Canadian same-sex marriage.
"This decision is a timely reminder to the Australian government that banning same-sex couples from marriage is a breach of human rights," gay rights activist Rodney Croome said on Saturday.
