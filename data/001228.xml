  <title>Missing Victorian man's kayak found</title>
  <content>
A distinct yellow kayak belonging to a missing Victorian fisherman has been found, but the search for its owner continues.
Torquay resident Junichi Yoshimura, 41, has been missing for more than four days and after a widespread search his kayak was found on Monday, 16km west of Edithvale in Port Phillip Bay.
The discovery was made more than 60km east of the Altona boat ramp where Mr Yoshimura's car was parked.
It is believed the Japanese man left home about 5am on Thursday to go fishing but did not take a wetsuit or life jacket.
Authorities say Mr Yoshimura often went fishing but it is unclear which direction he had headed.
The search continues.
