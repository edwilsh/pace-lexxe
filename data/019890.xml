  <title>Eagles' finals hopes blunted by Saints</title>
  <content>
WEST Coast's finals hopes are fading fast after coughing up a fourth-quarter lead to lose to St Kilda by eight points at Etihad Stadium on Sunday.
The Eagles were up by more than two goals after Mark LeCras' third goal midway through the final term.
But going into the final minutes of an entertaining, fast-paced encounter, it was the Saints who found the will to win.
Josh Kennedy put the pressure on with his fifth goal to get his team within one point at the 27-minute mark. But rather than feel the pressure, the Saints responded with a terrific mark to Josh Bruce and a match-winning goal by Jack Billings.
The 15.13 (103) to 14.11 (95) loss sees the Eagles drop to ninth on the ladder, behind eighth-placed Essendon on percentage.
WA's Blake Acres did plenty of damage for the Saints with 30 disposals, six tackles and six inside-50s.
Kennedy was West Coast's best with five goals, while Andrew Gaff picked up a team-high 30 touches.
