  <title>Sex abuse claim rocks school</title>
  <content>
A BRISBANE Catholic girls' school has become the latest institution to be rocked by reports of the historical sexual abuse of one of its students.
Sharon Volp, principal of Mt St Michael's College in Ashgrove, emailed a letter to current and former students on Monday confirming the school had received a "formal complaint" about the actions of a former staff member in 1976-78.
Ms Volp said the matter had been referred to police but urged anyone with similar concerns to come forward and contact the school.
