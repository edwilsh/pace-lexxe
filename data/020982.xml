  <content>
An investigation is underway into the death of a woman whose body was found in bushland north of Cooktown, on Queensland's Cape York Peninsula.
The body found on Sunday is believed to be 42-year-old Donna Louise Steele, who has been missing since August 3.
Ms Steele was last spotted at a Cooktown supermarket on Wednesday, having been seen the day before at a local caravan park.
Detectives investigating her disappearance were called to Leggett's Crossing, north of Cooktown, about 5.20am on Sunday, where the body was discovered.
Police are treating the death as suspicious and a crime scene has been established in the area.
Investigators have appealed for anyone with any information to come forward.
