"I look forward to joining the great team of people at Foodbank NSW & ACT, an organisation that has values consistent with mine, and that is changing lives by providing food to those most in need."
Opposition Leader Luke Foley said Labor "owes John a huge debt of gratitude for assuming the leadership at perhaps the lowest point in our history, immediately after the 2011 election".
"John's courage, tenacity and hard work rebuilt NSW Labor from the ashes of our 2011 electoral defeat," he said.
"As I said on the night of the 2015 election, the winning of 14 seats back off the Liberals was due in a very large part to the work of John Robertson in his period of leadership."
A former electrician, Mr Robertson came to public prominence as secretary of Unions NSW.
In that role he campaigned against then prime minister John Howard's WorkChoices industrial relations legislation before the 2007 federal election and opposed the Iemma Labor government's push to privatise electricity assets.
He entered the NSW Upper House in October 2008 and served as a minister in the Rees and Keneally governments.
After Labor's 2011 NSW election defeat - at which he won the seat of Blacktown -  and set about rebuilding a devastated parliamentary party.
But he whose December 2014 siege at the Lindt cafe in Martin Place left two hostages dead.
"I would never have dreamed as a 19-year-old apprentice electrician working on the extension to the NSW Parliament in 1981 that I would have these opportunities and achieve what I have," Mr Robertson said.
