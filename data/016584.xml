  <title>Binalong Brahmans use George Tooke to raise awareness for 'cruel' motor neurone disease</title>

A young mother who left behind a young daughter, a stalwart of the community and a coach's cousin - the Binalong Brahmans know better than most why it's so important to raise money and awareness for motor neurone disease.
For a town of less than 600 people to be affected by three cases of the "cruel" disease it's easy to see why the Brahmans picked the Motor Neurone Disease Association of NSW as their charity of choice for their 2017 George Tooke Shield campaign.Photo: Riva Potter, RS Williams Sports
With just one home game to go before finals, they're within touching distance of their $4000 goal.

When he raised the idea with Binalong president Ben Spencer, Brown found out another two people associated with the club also had the disease - local resident Lorraine Walker and Jersey Girls coach's cousin Sharn McNeill.
They've been collecting gold-coin donations at home games throughout the season and held a major fundraiser last weekend.

Their tally's about $3700, needing just a few hundred more to make their goal.
"When I spoke to Benny about it at the start of the year, he mentioned there was a couple of people in the Binalong community who were either suffering first-hand from it or second hand," Brown said.
The Brahmans face top-of-the-ladder Crookwell on Sunday, but with two rounds to go they've already guaranteed their spot in the finals after a couple of years' hiatus from the George Tooke Shield.
Sitting in fifth, they've got one home game remaining before finals.
Spencer said the fund-raising effort highlighted how big a role football teams could play in the community.
"I know just from the local lady, it's pretty horrific what she has to go through every day. It's a very cruel disease," he said
"It's good everyone gets behind it, it's always been like that the town.
"You can only do your best with raising funds to find a cure, but a lot of it is making people aware of it too."
