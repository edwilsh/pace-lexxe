  <title>First a Spit and polish, then came boos at rowdy night out</title>
  <content>
There could have been no better timing for the Queensland government to announce it was dumping the $3 billion ASF casino resort proposal on the Gold Coast's Spit.
It came just hours before Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and her ministers faced a rowdy town hall meeting at the Currumbin RSL, the largest held so far by the government.Photo: Supplied
 But of course, nothing could keep the anti-Adani protesters away. 
After mentioning the  to the crowd in her opening speech, all Ms Palaszczuk had to do was say: "That area is iconic" to whip the crowd into a frenzy.Photo: Supplied
Her immediate reward came in the form of cheers, nods and deafening applause - with some people even delivering her a standing ovation.
Some even yelled: "Hooray!"

Save Our Broadwater vice-president and former Labor MP Judy Spence told the Premier she had "made our dreams come true" with the Spit decision.

"I want to thank you for your decision on the Spit today," Ms Spence said.Photo: ASF Consortia
Adani did not take long to surface, making it into the second question.

"Why is your government supporting, what's my next word everybody?" she asked, before a few people yelled out: "Adani."
Ms Palaszczuk said unemployment was more than 10 per cent in Townsville, resources were an important part of the economy and 70 per cent of energy was from coal, with a plan for 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030.
After visiting Tesla in the US, Ms Palaszczuk said she was interested in attracting a battery factory to Queensland, which prompted a man to shout: "Get rid of Adani and build a battery factory then".
Others yelled out "Renewable energy!" and then "no, no way" when Ms Palaszczuk mentioned opening up more gas tenements.
An anti-Adani protester, Matthew Ross, 31, walked down the aisle shouting: "Down with Adani!"
"Where's your integrity? You campaigned on the reef, you campaigned to save the reef," Mr Ross, a social worker, yelled.
Another member of the crowd yelled: "Sit down you drongo" as security escorted him away, and Ms Palaszczuk said: "There are a lot more people here this evening, thank you, thanks for coming, thanks, see you later."
A larger number of  turned up for the government's previous community cabinet in Cairns.
There were 13 questions, with issues including foster care, retirement villages, light rail, wildlife, youth unemployment, public transport, the cruise ship terminal and affordable housing.
Extending the light rail proved contentious for Gold Coasters, including Karen from Palm Beach, who said she was against the light rail stage 3B, as she said it would travel through a koala preservation area in Burleigh Hill.
Karen's mention of Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate also drew a "boo" from the crowd.
River was also concerned about light rail and congestion, questioning whether the cabinet members jumped into their cars on the Gold Coast and drove to work in Brisbane.
"By whacking in a tram to Burleigh the bottleneck's only going to get bigger ... It is crap," he said.
River also encouraged the crowd to put their hands up: "Let's stop the tram!"
Only three minutes into Ms Palaszczuk's speech, before questions had begun, Janet called out "more child safety officers, please".
Ms Palaszczuk said she was glad the issue was raised because the number of children coming into care were from very complex family situations.
Margaret wanted to know what action was being taken to fix the Retirement Villages Act and whether residents could have input.
Ms Palaszczuk said legislation would come into the Parliament next month to make the process simpler.
"My grandmother recently went into a nursing home," she said.
"And it's actually very traumatic for the family in terms of the amount of paperwork.
"I'm a lawyer and it's very hard to understand it all. So I know how hard it is."
The town hall meeting lasted about an hour, with people bailing up ministers about specific issues afterwards.
Only time will tell whether it was enough for Labor to wrest some seats away from the LNP on the Gold Coast at the next election.
