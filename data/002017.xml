  <title>Fracking in NT support a 'misallocation' of Government's resources, analyst says</title>
  <content>
Government support for the fracking industry in the Northern Territory is a misallocation of resources that is "like following a rabbit down a hole", an energy analyst has told an inquiry.
It would be a mistake to allow hydraulic fracturing and gas development in the NT, said Bruce Robertson from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), which promotes the transition to a "diverse, sustainable and profitable energy economy".
A global gas glut, cost blowouts at other Australian plants, and disappointing royalty returns for governments were other reasons the Territory should steer clear of the unconventional gas extraction, he told the inquiry in Darwin on Monday.
"Government support for the industry is a misallocation of limited government resources," he said.
"I think we shouldn't be following this rabbit down the hole, that's why it's a misallocation of resources.
"You shouldn't actually be here, because the decision should've been made before this inquiry was done that it wasn't a wealth-creating industry for the Territory."
This is the second round of hearings for the inquiry, which will also travel to Alice Springs, Katherine and Tennant Creek, before the final report is drafted in late 2017.
The Labor Government instituted a moratorium on fracking until it could determine whether the practice could be done safely.
Remaining globally competitive

If the NT did allow fracking, Mr Robertson said one its biggest issues would be to remain competitive in a global marketplace.
"Producing high-cost onshore gas is not economic in a low-cost gas world," he said.
"Qatar is the world's lowest cost producer ... the fields that they were looking at developing in the NT, the production costs were $7.50 a gigajule. In Qatar, they're 20 cents.
"This is what we're competing against."
Fracking dividing the community

by a panel of experts listed numerous issues that must be managed if fracking is to go ahead in the NT, including water, land, greenhouse emissions, public health, Aboriginal people and culture, and social and economic impacts.
The report said that effective water management was necessary to develop any unconventional onshore shale gas industry in the Territory, while noting that a potential detraction from iconic NT landscapes was one of seven land-related risks of fracking.
Other land risks included inappropriate placing of infrastructure in development areas, poisoning of plants and animals, and soil contamination from chemical spills, the report found.
The panel of 10 scientists, led by Justice Rachel Pepper, has been travelling around the Northern Territory and consulting with community members about fracking.
"The anxiety, if not hostility, surrounding fracking was on display during the first round of community consultations held by the inquiry," the report said.
.
The report called for a robust regulatory framework if fracking were to go ahead.
"It's the principle way in which the Northern Territory Government can ensure that the development of any onshore unconventional shale gas industry is consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development," it said.
The Government said there would be two final reports: a draft expected around October, and a final report by the end of the year.
