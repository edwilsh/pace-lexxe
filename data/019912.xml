  <title>What happened when Shamrocks and Kiama boys swapped jerseys</title>
  <content>
Early in the second half last Saturday, as the Kiama U13s were leading the Shamrocks 40-0, the fine Kiama coach decided it would be a better game to pull one of his players from the field.

At 55-0, both coaches decided a new solution.

The game was stopped, and some of the Shamrocks and Kiama boys swapped jerseys.

Suddenly the game comes alive! Instead of a thrashing, it is a game.

The boys grin, and chase, and tackle their own team-members like mad things, as the ball surges back and forth up the field and the spectators roar with appreciation.
"It was so memorable," my spy says, "that a group photo was requested from parents from both sides.

Thank you Shamrocks U13s and Kiama U13s for reminding us what playing with the spirit of rugby is truly about. It was a joy to watch."
And that, friends, is rugby.
