  <title>Badger notches up 300th NRL game</title>
  <content>
GAVIN Badger will become just the fifth referee to reach the milestone of 300 NRL matches when he officiates in the Penrith-Wests Tigers match at Pepper Stadium on Sunday.
Badger will be lead referee in the match, which will see him join Bill Harrigan, Col Pearce, Shayne Hayne and Steve Clark in the exclusive club.
"Gavin should be very proud of what he has done for the game as a match official," NRL Head of Football Brian Canavan said.
"The game has changed significantly over the years so for Gavin to evolve as he has through different refereeing models to remain one of the leading referees in the game is a wonderful achievement."
NRL General Manager of Officiating Tony Archer congratulated Badger on the milestone.
"Gavin is one of the hardest-working officials in the group and that sort of dedication is something all officials can aspire to," Archer said.
"Officiating in the NRL Premiership is clearly challenging but Gavin has been able to remain at the top of his game for a long period of time.
"He is someone young referees can and should look up to."
