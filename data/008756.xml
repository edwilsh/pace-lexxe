  <title>West Coast's Sam Mitchell announces his AFL retirement</title>
  <content>
West Coast veteran Sam Mitchell will retire at the end of the AFL season.
At a press conference on Wednesday, the former Hawk said that the Eagles playing St Kilda in Melbourne on Sunday was the spur to make the announcement.
"It's our last fixtured game in Melbourne this year so that's the reason for calling it now," Mitchell said.
"Being a one-year Eagle and a 15-year Hawk, it's not easy to sit here. I have so many people to thank at Hawthorn."
He thanked Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson and former teammate Luke Hodge, and also thanked his parents.
"To my parents, thank you. Only now as a parent myself so I realise how much mum and dad had to do for me," he said. 

Mitchell, who crossed from Hawthorn to the Eagles at the end of last year, will play out the season before hanging up his boots.
"There's not just four weeks left in my eyes, there's a lot more football left in this group for this year," Mitchell said. 
"The way the guys have embraced me has been fantastic.

"I'm so thankful to sit up here and to have been able to have the best job in the world."
He will take up a full-time coaching role at the club.
Mitchell's retirement comes just five days after fellow Brownlow medallist Matt Priddis also announced 2017 would be his final AFL season.
Priddis was contracted for next year, but said he no longer felt he could maintain his high standards.
Drew Petrie is also set to retire at the end of the season.
The futures of Sam Butler, Eric Mackenzie, Josh Hill, and Mark LeCras remain up in the air.
Mitchell will go down as one of the game's all-time greats.
The 34-year-old has played 323 games, won four premierships, been named an All- Australian on three occasions, and was awarded the 2012 Brownlow medal after Jobe Watson was stripped of the honour.
Mitchell has been one of West Coast's best players this season, averaging 27 disposals per game.
When he first arrived at the Eagles he left the door wide open to play on in 2018.
But with the Eagles now turning their attention towards youth, Mitchell will step aside at the end of the year to embark on his coaching career.
