  <title>Review: Fire dulls for indie legends</title>
  <content>
FLOP: Everything Now marks Arcade Fire's first misstep.

IT was inevitable wasn't it? Arcade Fire eventually had to release a dud album. That's not to say the Canadian indie rockers' fifth record Everything Now is terrible, it just fails to register anything close to the lofty heights achieved by Funeral, Neon Bible, The Suburbs and Reflektor.

Everything Now is Arcade Fire's exploration of groove and dance music, incorporating elements of reggae, funk and electronica. The title track and Creature Comfort execute their trademark anthemic emotion, but the album contains the worst songs ever recorded by Arcade Fire.
Chemistry limps along with its bland reggae, Electric Blue drones on with Regine Chassagne's high-pitched vocal and Infinite Content, well, lacks any real content.
