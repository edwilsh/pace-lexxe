  <title>Public housing revamp revealed</title>
  <content>
NEW images shed light on a planned multi-million dollar overhaul to a Northcote public housing estate.
The dilapidated Walker St housing estate, which includes 87 dwellings, will be torn down and rebuilt under a $185 million State Government program.
There are currently seven walk-up apartment blocks on the site no taller than five storeys.
Documents released last month by the Department of Housing and Human Services reveal the new housing blocks could be as tall as eight storeys.
The program will renew nine ageing Melbourne estates with the promise of a 10 per cent increase in public housing units.
The Walker St estate was built in the 1960s and is inaccessible for people with disabilities.
The renewal program will use a public-private partnership model and mix private homes with public housing.
Most dwellings will be one and two-bedroom units.
Residents have been told they will have the right to return once the development is complete, but some have raised concerns over the loss of three-bedroom units.
