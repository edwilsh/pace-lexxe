  <title>Why Marvel actors aren't given scripts anymore</title>
  <content>
IN THE age of social media, internet hackers and chatty celebrities, it's no surprise that movie studios are continually amping up security on their biggest movies.
Marvel Cinematic Universe, the studio behind most of the world's biggest superhero flicks, seem to have taken things to a whole new level to keep the upcoming Avengers: Infinity War a secret.
Actress Elizabeth Olsen, who plays the Scarlet Witch in the superhero franchise, recently appeared on revealing that none of the cast are allowed to see the entire script.
It was when the late night host pushed the 28-year-old actress for spoilers for the 2018 movie that she revealed the film's directors Joe and Anthony Russo had censored her script.
"This time they actually decided to not give us scripts," she said, adding they only gave her the pages with her own dialogue and gave her context by "explaining other things that are happening".
The directors' script censorship means that, when Olsen goes to see the movie, she's going to be in the same boat as everyone else.
"I'll be so shocked and surprised. I'll be like 'Oh I see, that's what was happening to the world at that time'," she told Colbert.
And, while Olsen definitely won't be dropping any spoilers about the upcoming movie, the studio's biggest worry wasn't the actress - it was Spider-Man: Homecoming star Tom Holland.
The young actor became so notorious for running his mouth and accidentally revealing plot lines that the studio resorted to keeping Holland completely in the dark - not even telling the actor who he was fighting.
"Yeah, there is one moment in Avengers where I don't know who that person is. And I'm fighting him, and there's nothing more embarrassing than pretending to fight a 'monster' in front of 200 people, in Spandex. You know, literally like dodging stuff and trying to web him. They're all like, 'That's Great Tom, more energy. More Energy. Jump. Jump,"
The actor worked with so much CGI, or "tennis balls" as he calls them, that it wasn't until the red carpet for Captain America: Civil War that he met all of the other avengers.
Avengers: Infinity War won't hit cinemas until May, 2018 which means Marvel still have 10 months of trying to keep everything under wraps.
