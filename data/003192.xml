  <title>Adani loan high risk for taxpayers: report</title>
  <content>
Taxpayers would have little hope of recouping their investment if a $1 billion concessional loan was granted to the Adani Carmichael mine, according to a new analysis.
The Indian mining giant has applied for the loan from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility but an analysis by economic consulting firm ACIL Allen for the Australian Conservation Foundation found the loan would be a high risk for taxpayers due to global uncertainty around the future of coal.
"Handing out $1 billion of public money to Adani would be throwing good money after bad, all in the name of cooking the planet," foundation economist Matt Rose said on Tuesday.
