  <title>Dangerous surf off the Hunter</title>
  <content>
DANGEROUS surf conditions are forecast to batter the Hunter coast on Thursday and Friday. 
The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a strong wind warning for the next two days, prompting a Roads and Maritime Services warning to skippers. 
The conditions are expected to snake around the NSW coast between Byron and the Eden coast. 
"Boat skippers should consider changing or delaying their voyage before considering crossing a coastal bar or heading offshore," the RMS advises.

"Rock fishers should avoid coastal rock platforms exposed to the ocean and seek a safe location sheltered from the surf."

Vessels in need of maintenance can also become damaged on moorings during strong winds.

Skippers are urged to check weather before and during boating, ensure they are equipped for the conditions, log in and out with a Marine Rescue NSW radio base and consider a safety management plan.
