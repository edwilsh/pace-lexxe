Police believe the death of a far north Queensland woman was not a "random event" and the person responsible was likely someone she knew.
Crime scenes have been set up at Cooktown, on Queensland's Cape York Peninsula, after a woman's body was found in Isobella Creek, about 20 kilometres from the town centre.
Detective Inspector Geoff Marsh said a scientific examination had been done on the body and police were "of the belief" it was missing person Donna Louise Steele.
The mother of two was last seen at the IGA supermarket in the "small, rural, coastal" town at midday on Wednesday, Detective Inspector Marsh said.
When her two boys, aged eight and 10, arrived home from school at 4.30pm that afternoon, she was not home.
Her partner, who worked away from home, came back on Thursday evening and called police immediately.

"Upon his arrival home, obviously the absence of the mother of the two children was of grave concern....and he made a report to police," Inspector Marsh said.
He said the 42-year-old woman worked "from time to time" at a caravan park at Cooktown and was "well known" to the community.

"She had two young children who attended the local school," Inspector Marsh said.
"Cooktown is a very tight-knit community, they all know each other."
He said at this stage, there was "nothing to suggest this is a random event".
"We are confident this is a known person to her," he said.
Crime scenes have been set up at the mother's home and the area around Isobella Creek, a popular fishing and swimming spot, where a dive squad will search the creek.
Detective Inspector Marsh said there were a lot of locals who wanted to help and police have taken a number of statements.
"It has devastated that small community and we are hoping that that will embolden people to come forward with information," he said.
"The fact she was missing, they might have kept it to themselves but now they know a body has been located it might trigger them to come forward."
Anyone with information is urged to contact police or Crime Stoppers.
