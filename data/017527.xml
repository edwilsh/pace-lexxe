  <title>The Next Game Of Thrones Episode Just Leaked Online</title>
  <content>
The fourth episode of Game of Thrones Season 7 has been leaked online, following a large-scale hacking incident at HBO. Here are the details.

Yesterday, Reddit users began sharing a Google Drive page containing the leaked episode, which Gizmodo has confirmed as authentic. The video is watermarked with
Star TV India and in low-quality standard definition. The watermark suggests that the leak is not actually related to HBO's recent hacking scandal. (Thus is backed up by a report on Hollywood Reporter.

This Sunday's Game of Thrones ep 4 has hit torrent sites, but sources inside HBO say NOT related to hack. Ep was lost by Indian distributor

The original file has since been removed at the request of rights holders but it shouldn't be too difficult to track down on line if you're that way inclined. Personally, we think you'll be better off waiting for the high quality stream (or illegal torrent) on Monday.
