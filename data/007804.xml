  <title>Firefighter charged in relation to Kurri Kurri fires</title>
  <content>
A retained firefighter and another man have been charged in relation to bushfires at Kurri Kurri earlier this year.

The fires broke out at Chinamans Hollow, Hart Road, Loxford, and McLeod Road at Kurri Kurri on January 18.
Police commenced investigations to establish the causes of the fires and identify those responsible.
Following investigations a 28-year-old man was arrested at a home in Hall Street, Weston on Monday.

He was taken to Maitland Police Station and charged with four counts of intentionally causing a fire and concealing a serious indictable offence of another person.

Strike force detectives also arrested a 27-year-old man on Tuesday.
He was charged with an additional three counts of intentionally causing a fire. He was refused bail to appear at Newcastle Local Court on Wednesday.
The 28-year-old was granted conditional bail to appear at Cessnock Local Court in September.

Central Hunter detectives and the SCC Property Crime Squad's Arson Unit formed Strike Force Hingerty to investigate the fires.

Strike Force detectives are continuing their inquiries into the matter.
