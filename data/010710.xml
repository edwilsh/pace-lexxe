  <title>US police officers in bodycam video accused of planting evidence</title>
  <content>
US police in Baltimore are investigating a second bodycam video which allegedly shows police officers working together to plant drugs.

The latest video shows the officers searching a car for drugs.  The police arrest a suspect, who accuses them of harassing him for days.

The public defender's office told CBS News nothing was found in the car until the police officers turned their cameras off.

When the footage resumes, a police officer is seen crouching down next to the passenger side of the car.

Another officer then approaches and crouches down in the same spot and discovers a bag of drugs.

Police bodycams in the US have a function where they record 30 seconds prior to the camera's being turned off in order to provide context.

The new video comes just weeks after another police bodycam video in Baltimore was leaked appearing to show a police officer planting drugs in a back alley rubbish heap.

Baltimore Police have vowed they will investigate fully "anytime an allegation of misconduct is made".

Meanwhile, Baltimore officials have announced thirty-four criminal cases have been thrown out as authorities investigate three police officers accused of planting evidence at crime scenes.
