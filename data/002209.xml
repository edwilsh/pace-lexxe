  <title>The secret tactic set to stop Melbourne hoons in their tracks</title>
  <content>
A disguised road material designed to stop hoons has been rolled out in the Melbourne region of Hume.
The coarse surface, which is unnoticeable to the average person,  has the ability to shred the tyres of motorists driving dangerously.
"It basically puts a rougher seal on top of the road," Inspector Anthony Brown from Victoria Police told 9NEWS.
Hume Council launched a trial of the material with police back in April, after topping the list for the most impounded cars in 2016.
"We hope that it will deter intentional high risk driving," Insp. Brown said.
Exact locations of affected have been kept under the radar, but officers said they have targeted regular hoon hot spots.
Despite the innovation, Campbellfield business owner Kirsty Shipway said she believes this initiative will only shift reckless drivers elsewhere.

"They still have the opportunity to run a circuit," Ms Shipway said.
The trial is expected to run for 12 months.
