  <title>Sore Joel Selwood still hopeful of facing Tigers</title>

Selwood hurt and assisted off
The Cats skipper appears to have a bad leg injury

TOUGH Geelong skipper Joel Selwood was on crutches on Saturday after rolling his left ankle during Friday night's 46-point loss to Sydney at Simonds Stadium but is "definitely hopeful" he won't miss any games.

He was hurt in the second quarter and had the ankle strapped before playing on, but a Lance Franklin tackle in the third term caused him more discomfort.

The 29-year-old finished the game with his foot on ice but he told reporters on Saturday morning he expected his ankle to recover quickly.

"(I'm) definitely hopeful, obviously non-weight bearing for the weekend and it's amazing how they can come up," Selwood said.

The Cats face Richmond next Saturday afternoon at Simonds Stadium and they will be boosted by Patrick Dangerfield's return from a one-match suspension.

Coach Chris Scott was confident after the Swans game Selwood would be declared fit. 

"It's sore, just as we probably thought it would be," Selwood said.

"We'll have some scans and see how it comes up."

He tried to persevere, even after being hurt a second time, before ultimately sitting the game out.

"The second one I probably felt a little bit more. I tried to get out for the early bit of the last quarter and just couldn't get it going so I decided to call it a night," Selwood said.
