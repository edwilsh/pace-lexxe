  <title>Aust needs more climate scientists: report</title>
  <content>
An influx of new climate scientists and modellers is needed to keep Australia's climate research sector up to scratch, a new report shows.
An Australian Academy of Science report on the country's climate science agencies has called for the creation of about 80 new research positions, including 30 scientists and modellers, over the next four years.
"If these gaps are not filled, the effects will not be immediately catastrophic, but Australia will increasingly be less and less able to have a sufficient level of information to make informed decisions," the report said on Thursday.
