Organisers of the Diggers and Dealers mining forum set to start next week in Kalgoorlie have reversed their decision to cancel the traditional Aboriginal Welcome to Country ceremony.
Last week, event organiser John Langford said there was no room in the program to accommodate the ceremony at the investment conference.
Originally, the ceremony was marked down to take up to half an hour.
But after consultations with Kalgoorlie elder and custodian Trevor Donaldson a new arrangement for a shorter ceremony has been made.
Forum chairman Nick Giorgetta said Mr Donaldson had assured him the new presentation would last no longer than 10 minutes and would not be used to make any kind of political statement.
"It is now time for the focus of Diggers and Dealers to return to the investment conference that it is," Mr Giorgetta said.
Mr Donaldson told the ABC there had been a been a miscommunication about what his presentation would have entailed.
"I don't where they got that from, because most of the ones I do, normally 5 minutes, 6, 7 - I don't think I've gone more than 10 minutes," he said.
He said had organisers spoken to him earlier, the confusion could have been avoided.
Common ground for Aboriginal people and miners

Mr Donaldson said his previous expressions of disappointment about the initial decision to cancel the ceremony were not personal attacks.
He said the international event was a wonderful way to showcase Indigenous heritage.
Mr Donaldson said the welcome was a simple way to help local Aboriginal people feel acknowledged.
"We play a part in the economy here, we play a part in the community," he said.
"Hopefully at the end of the day there are no hard feelings. We move on and we've got a community to take care of out there."
Mr Donaldson said his presentation revolved around the the iconic Salmon Gum trees found throughout the southern Goldfields.
He said the trees connected Aboriginal people with the mining industry.
"Historically they played a role in the development and the building of Kalgoorlie,  timber for the mines, buildings, infrastructure, railways," Mr Donaldson said.
"It's part of us. It gives shade, food and our old people had stories songs and dances connected to it."
Mr Donaldson has direct links to a number of senior Aboriginal men and women from the Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie area.
The land around the Kalgoorlie region is a contentious Native Title environment, and a claim is still being processed.
