  <title>Charlie's angels putting their hearts into this year's fun run</title>

When Charlie Manwaring's parents noticed he was not putting on weight they took him to Canberra Hospital. What came back from the tests was the  news no parent ever wants to hear - Charlie's heart was four times the size it was meant to be.

Charlie had a narrowed Aorta, multiple holes in his hearts chamber and his mitral valve had parachuted which could lead to ongoing issues. The surgery Charlie received repaired his Aorta, and one of the holes in his heart, however many holes remain.
Two hours after being operated on Charlie went into cardiac arrest and suffered a stroke. The right side of his body was not functioning properly.
It took two weeks until Charlie was allowed to leave intensive care. Another two weeks was spent in the Edgar Stephens ward recovering and weening off drugs he had become dependent on.    
Just months after Charlie's harrowing ordeal, it's hard to believe what the happy, bubbly smiling boy has been through.

In order to raise awareness of children like Charlie, the Manwaring family will be running in this year's Canberra Times fun run to raise money for the Heart Kids foundation.
"We were both able to be there [hospital] the whole time, and we think other families going through it are going to benefit from having two people there, and we know that's not possible for everyone and we feel very lucky." Charlie's mother Kate Manwaring said.

"Eight Australian babies are born with a heart defect each day, Heart Kids supports families emotionally and financially," Charlie's father Allan said.
The family's initial goal was to raise $800 dollars, but amazingly they have already raised $2000. Their running team will consist of 17 close friends and family, and they will be jogging 5kms.
