  <title>SA driver almost hit child in playground</title>
  <content>
A man has been arrested after he crashed his car into a playground in South Australia, narrowly missing a small child.
Police say the 23-year-old man, who was driving an unregistered car, ignored a signal to pull over on Sunday afternoon and instead sped off and crashed through two fences before ploughing into a playground nearly running over a young child at Port Pirie.
The man tested positive to methamphetamine and is set to appear in the Port Pirie Magistrates Court on Monday.
