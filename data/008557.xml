  <title>Will Ferrell's company to make No Activity</title>
  <content>
Will Ferrell's Gary Sanchez production company is making an American version of Australian comedy No Activity.
The Anchorman star's company will develop the cop show as an eight-part series, commissioned by CBS All Access.
No Activity stars Patrick Brammall and Darren Gilshenan as two hapless detectives on a stakeout and is made in Australia by production company Jungle for streaming service Stan.
The show will keep some of its Aussie flavour as both Brammall and Trent O'Donnell, the show's creators, have been signed on as the showrunners and executive producers of the US version, and Jungle will also be working with Gary Sanchez on the production.
Jason Burrows and Joe Farrell, also from the Australian side, will serve as executive producers of the US version.
The list of stars appearing in the two-season show reads like a who's who of Australian TV comedy including Rose Byrne, Tim Minchin, Sam Simmons and Harriet Dyer.
There have also been some heavy-hitters from drama, such as Ewen Leslie, Damon Herriman and Dan Wyllie.
Filming will begin on the US production towards the end of the year and it will be screened on Stan in Australia.
