Pick a Winner: Rich v Haw
Duck and Browny preview the Tigers v Hawks

Josh Caddy could play an important role against the Hawks

SUMMARY
The Tigers could end the Hawks' finals charge once and for all on Sunday and every September-bound team will be watching in anticipation. Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson has manufactured a magnificent revival from 1-5, throwing the magnets around and getting the best out of Jack Gunston, James Sicily and Taylor Duryea in new roles. But with eight wins and one draw, his team must win its remaining four games to stay in the hunt. Richmond (12-6) sits fourth and starts round 20 with a one-match buffer to protect. The Tigers have structural issues in attack they are dealing with, but have won three matches on the trot. Damien Hardwick's men are winning ugly when they need to, with superstar midfielder - and new Brownlow Medal favourite - Dustin Martin in unrivalled form after his 11th game this season with 30 possessions or more against the Suns in round 19.

THE SIX POINTS

2. The Tigers continue to be difficult to score against with the second-best defence this season, conceding only 78 points a game. They have given up 100 points in a game twice, the equal best of any side.

3. The Tigers are a low disposal team this season, ranked No.17 with an average of 363.2 a game. The Hawks rank No.8 with an average of 392.1 a game.

4. This clash will be the first time since round 12, 2006 that the teams will play with Richmond higher on the ladder than Hawthorn.

5. Hawthorn's uncontested possession game has returned in recent weeks, with the team now ranked No.3 with an average of 255.8 a game. The Tigers rank last at an average of 214.9 a game.

6. After a steady decline in form last season, Brandon Ellis has been climbing the  this season. He has moved from No.263 overall at the start of the season to a career-high No.174. He ranks No.8 at Richmond.

IT'S A BIG WEEK FOR ... Josh Caddy.
The former Cat was played as a deeper forward against Gold Coast and will again need to compete in the air against the Hawks. Regardless of whether Jack Riewoldt is passed fit, the Tigers will need an aerial presence to combat intercept defenders James Sicily and Jack Gunston, who are thriving in new roles. Caddy will need to compete as an undersized forward, but he has the physical strength and ability in the air to make the role work.   

PREDICTION: Richmond by 12 points
