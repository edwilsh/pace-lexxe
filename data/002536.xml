  <title>'Suck my b----'  --  Formula 1 drivers' track spat gets nasty on live TV</title>
  <content>
Tempers flared between Formula 1 rivals Nico Hulkenberg and Kevin Magnussen after they clashed during the Hungary Grand Prix on Sunday.

The two drivers exchanged unpleasantries on live Norwegian TV after Hulkenberg was forced off the track when he attempted to overtake Magnussen with just nine laps remaining.

Race stewards immediately investigated the incident and punished Magnussen with a five-second penalty "," according to the official website of Formula 1.

Hulkenberg confronted Magnussen in the media pen and called him "unsporting" but the latter was unapologetic. He simply said: "Suck my balls, honey."

You can watch the exchange here:

"I congratulated him for being the most unsporting driver of the whole grid again," . "When it comes to racing, he's just nasty."

Magnussen finished in 13th place at the Hungary GP, four places ahead of Nico Hulkenberg. The race was won by Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel.
