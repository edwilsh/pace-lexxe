  <title>Pregnant doctor puts own birth on hold to help deliver another baby</title>
  <content>
A pregnant doctor in the US has put her own labour aside to help another woman give birth.
Doctor Amanda Hess was at Frankfort Regional Medical Center in Kentucky, ready to be induced, when a woman in another room began to scream.
Dr Hess had treated Leah Halliday Johnson just days before and when she found out it was her screaming she insisted on assisting with the birth as the on-call doctor had just left the hospital.
"I had actually taken a call the day before, so I thought really that I was working up to the last minute. But this was literally 'til the last second,'" Dr Hess told .
"I put on some boots over my flip flops and found another gown to cover myself up and did put my stuff to deliver on and delivered a baby."
Dr Hess's contractions began minutes after she delivered Ms Halliday Johnson's baby girl.
She gave birth to her own daughter, Ellen Joyce.
