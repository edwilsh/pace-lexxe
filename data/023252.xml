  <title>Baby humpback whale beaches on Moreton Island</title>
  <content>
A STRANDED humpback whale calf that was stranded on Moreton Island today has been euthanised.

It is understood the 4-metre calf was euthanised following Sea World veterinary advice to prevent the whale suffering further.

Earlier, ranger Terry Christensen said the calf, which was about 4m long, beached at Bulwer Wrecks on the northwestern side of the island, at about midday.

Rangers and Marine Parks staff desperately tried to keep the whale cool and wet until the tide came in, in the hope they could refloat it.It is understood the 4-metre calf was euthanised following Sea World veterinary advice to prevent the whale suffering further.
