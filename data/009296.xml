  <title>THE ULTIMATE DODGY SURVEY ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT</title>
  <content>
"We should all be shocked," groaned Australian National University boss Brian Schmidt, who reporters said was "emotional" and "visibly upset". 

Schmidt was tearing up over a , released on Tuesday, which claimed 51 per cent of Australian university students were sexually harassed last year.
And, yes, we should be shocked and visibly upset - shocked and upset that the commission perpetrated such a hoax. We should be shocked and upset that not one university boss had the brains or guts to call out this fraud of a study.
We should also be furious that Education Minister Simon Birmingham treated these joke findings as serious, demanding universities take action when he should instead demand the HRC apologise for smearing and damaging the universities that earn us $20 billion a year from foreign students.
Ask yourself: is it remotely likely that 51 per cent of all university students, male and female, were sexually harassed last year?
