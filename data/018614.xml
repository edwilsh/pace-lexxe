  <title>'That was very bad': Usain Bolt runs his last 100m</title>
  <content>
Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt is going into his last-ever 100-metre race feeling less-than-confident after delivering a "very bad" performance in his heat at the World Championships in London on Friday (UK time).
The eight-time Olympic gold medallist, who plans to retire after the championships, completed the race in 10.07 seconds but wasn't happy with his performance.
"That was very bad, I stumbled coming out of the blocks ... I have to get this start together because I can't keep doing this," he said.
"I'm glad I got to push myself, blow the cobwebs out. I'm feeling OK, but it wasn't a great race."
The Bolt, 30, has won every Olympic and world 100m and 200m since 2008, with the exception of the 100m at the 2011 Daegu world titles, when he false-started in the final.
The Finale. Let's do this.

The semi-finals and final will take place on Saturday morning UK time.
Bolt is also scheduled to contest the 4x100m relay on the penultimate day of the championships which run until August 13.
