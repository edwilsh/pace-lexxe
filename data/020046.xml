  <title>Man turns himself in after 'unflattering' mugshot</title>
  <content>
A MAN wanted over an alleged assault deemed his mugshot so unflattering that he turned himself into police.
Wayne Esmonde, 35, was wanted by South Wales Police in connection with an assault on July 18 in Fforestfach, Swansea.
A picture of him with a shaven head and wide eyes was posted by South Wales Police on their Facebook page.
Mr Esmonde, who spotted his mugshot on social media, asked officers to take the post down before handing himself in at Swansea Central police station.
He commented on his mugshot, saying that it was "not very flattering".
"I am him. Not a very flattering mugshot," he wrote, according to the BBC.
"I'd appreciate it if you'd take this post down. Innocent until proven guilty and all that.
"I've spoken to my solicitor and they will advise me what to do next. Thanks."
