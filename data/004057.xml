  <content>
Paramedics have treated three Victorian prison officers after a violent prisoner attacked them in a Melbourne prison.
It's understood the prisoner at the Melbourne Assessment Prison attacked three staff on Sunday and they were seen by paramedics but not taken to hospital.
The prisoner had also threatened an officer with a shiv a week earlier. The Victorian Justice Department has been contacted for comment.
