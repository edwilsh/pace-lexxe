  <title>NSW terror suspects 'linked' to IS figures</title>
  <content>
Four men arrested in Sydney over an alleged conspiracy to bring down a commercial aircraft reportedly have clear links to Islamic State figures overseas.
The men, named in media reports as fathers and sons Khaled and Mahmoud Khayat and Khaled and Abdul Merhi, remain behind bars despite not yet being charged following their arrest on Saturday.
Khaled Khayat's brother is believed to be a senior IS figure, while the other two men are related to Ahmed Merhi, who travelled to Syria in 2014, the ABC reported on Monday.
However, authorities have continued refusing to elaborate on the group's plot to "bring down" a plane and won't confirm if a series of raids in Surry Hills, Lakemba, Wiley Park and Punchbowl were triggered by overseas intelligence.
Two theories have emerged about the alleged plot, with the men reportedly planning to either smuggle a bomb onto a plan inside a meat grinder, or use a poisonous gas.
Travellers at Australian airports will on Tuesday face another day of delays amid heightened security screenings.
Australian National University criminologist Dr Clarke Jones said the government needed to go "back to basics" and invest in prevention measures.

"It's been full steam ahead in relation to security, legislation, police and intelligence, all at the expense of community resilience and building up protective mechanisms within vulnerable communities," he told AAP.
The men are being held in Sydney under terrorism legislation which grants authorities the power to keep them in custody as evidence is gathered to support charges.
