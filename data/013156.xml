  <title>Is this the most impractical shoe?</title>
  <content>
YOU know that moment when something incredibly impractical comes along, but you just need to have it? Enter, Saint Laurent's latest must-have accessory - roller -skate stilettos.
Yes, you heard us correctly.
Three-inch stiletto heels, with a roller-skate wheel attached to the bottom and a kick-stop brake - because it's just so easy walking in a normal pair of heels.
Aptly dubbed the Anja 100 Patch Pop Pump Roller, the heels are part of Saint Laurent's autumn/winter collection and are yours for a mere Â£1,995 (AU $3,315).
But if skating around in sky-high sequins and snakeskin seems a bit dangerous, the fashion house has also released a sneaker version for the less adventurous type.
They may not make it into the everyday attire but they're sure to get your friends talking.
