  <title>Kennedy's return to boost 'even' Swans: Longmire</title>
  <content>
John Longmire praised Will Hayward's effort in the big win over Geelong

SYDNEY is hopeful of regaining captain Josh Kennedy for next Saturday's clash against Fremantle at the SCG, coach John Longmire says.

The champion midfielder's presence was hardly missed as the Swans romped to a 46-point thumping of Geelong at Simonds Stadium on Friday night.

Kennedy missed the game against the Cats with hamstring tightness picked up in last Friday night's matchup with the Hawks.

"He's definitely not ruled out, which is a good thing," Longmire said.

"He ran on Wednesday at training so we're hopeful of getting him back but we're not sure until we see what he does during the week at training.

"An eight-day (sic) break might help him."

Sydney leapt out to a 32-point quarter-time lead after slamming home seven goals to two in a blitz reminiscent of last year's preliminary final between the two teams.

The Swans booted 16 goals to Geelong's eight, with superstar forward Lance Franklin kicking just one on the night, while they had nine individual goal kickers.

"It was the evenness of the contribution of the players right across the board," Longmire said.

"We didn't have any real absolute standouts.

"It was a really even performance. Clearly that first quarter was really important to go away and have the use of the pretty significant wind, as it turned out, and make the most of it was a really good start."

With Franklin subdued by miserly Geelong defender Tom Lonergan, youngsters Tom Papley (three goals) and Will Hayward (three) both bobbed up.

"They probably book-ended the game a little bit," Longmire said.

"The first quarter was Papley hitting the scoreboard and then the last quarter was Hayward.

"Papley's a second year player and Hayward's a first year player so it's good to have them contribute."

The Swans' defence also played its part, keeping the Cats' forward line to just 61 points.

Sydney has now restricted Geelong to 60, 60 and 61 points over the past three meetings between the sides. The Swans also continued their stranglehold over their opponents, winning their third-straight game against the Cats.

Longmire said it was great to have the luxury of swinging Sam Reid, who returned from a groin injury, into defence or up forward with the athletic big man taking seven marks and racking up 16 disposals.

"He's a smart player. He's good to have in our front half and he was marking it quite well and particularly early he gave us a real focal point," Longmire said.

"But then to put him back when we need to... he plays both roles well and I thought he did both well tonight."

The Swans have now won 11 of their past 13 matches after starting the season with six losses on the trot.
