  <title>Sydney terror raids: Ramped-up airport security just 'window dressing', expert warns</title>
  <content>
A security and terrorism expert  in the wake of the weekend's alleged bomb plot arrests is just "window dressing".

Key points:

Men allegedly plotted to use bomb made out of meat grinder
Expert says increased security measures at airports aren't enough
He says training staff to better interpret human behaviour is the answer

Extra  after  made out of a meat grinder were arrested in anti-terror raids across Sydney on Saturday.
But Roger Henning, the chief executive of Homeland Security Asia/Pacific, says airport security scanners do not pick up every threat.
"The plot that has unravelled in the last couple of days, probably would've been stopped if they were using a metal kitchen object as part of their [explosive device]," he .
"But there are other ways of blowing up aeroplanes and they're certainly not covered by anything the Australian Government or agencies have done to date.
"There is no scanner that can pick up plastic explosives."
He said it was "ridiculous" for politicians to know of the loopholes and to still say scanners were the answer.
Mr Henning said the "one missing ingredient" was "human intelligence".
"The only chance you've got is to have everybody who works at an airport trained to observe human behaviour," he said, calling for better training for security staff.
"Human intervention is the best weapon against terrorism because people are likely to appear out of character.
"The only real difficulty with this in my experience is that a determined bomber, or suicide bomber, usually exhibits serenity.
"They don't look like the typical version of a bearded man, with a black beard and black hair, at all.
"The actions that we are taking at the moment are based on the premise that every suicide bomber looks the same and every suicide bomber is going to be identified by putting them through the metal detector. That isn't the case."
'It is safe to travel on aircraft,' minister says

This morning the Federal Government moved to reassure travellers that airports are safe.
"I can tell people in Australia that it is safe to travel on aircrafts," Justice Minister Michael Keenan said, describing the alleged plot as "quite sophisticated".
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was pressed on the possibility that bombs could be brought onto planes by airport catering or freight workers.
"As far as airports are concerned we have very robust security measures in place, including the vetting of people who work at airports," he said.
"Australians should be reassured that we have the finest security and intelligence agencies in the world.
"This is now the 13th terrorist plot that has been disrupted since 2014."
Mr Henning said while Australia's security measures were "certainly better" than those in many other countries, more work was needed.
"We've pushed for more than a decade, publicly and in Senate enquiries, for this to be addressed and for the workforce to be trained and engage," he said.
He said Tel Aviv and Singapore were good examples of airports Australia should be looking at.
"In every other occupation, and particularly on high-risk critical infrastructure sites, including the ABC, there are mandatory evacuation exercises that have to be completed every year," he said.
"Airports are supposed to go through an evacuation process at least once a year.
"Some Australian airports have not had an evacuation exercise, a full exercise, for over a decade."
Police will continue to gather evidence at five homes in Sydney today as they piece together the details of the alleged threat.
The ABC understands police are confident they have arrested all members of the alleged terrorist cell.
It is not yet known what type of plane the group allegedly wanted to target, or when they intended to carry out the attack.
