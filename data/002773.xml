  <title>Caring souls planted seeds of commitment</title>
  <content>
INSPIRATION: Diana Santleben, and those like her, have been praised for their caring nature, with one contributor sharing his experience of the impact kindness can have.

AS an 88-year-old who was raised in an orphanage as a two-year-old, reading your feature article by Scott Bevan ('Passion to help', Herald, 29/7) my memories of the beautiful spirit, so demonstrated by our Newcastle Citizen of the Year Sister Diana Santleben, came rushing back to me. The same spirit and example was shown to me and my older sister and brother under the care of the sisters at St Patricks at Armidale, way back in 1931 when we were taken into their care.
So much has been revealed about the abuse by some in the church that it is easy to overlook the fact that the women of the faith are responsible for a long list of wonderful work for the disadvantaged over hundreds of years. Sister Santleben and the Sisters at St Pats are, and have been, the source of me and my sister and brother's commitment to my community over our lifetime. 
My late sister was awarded two Orders of Australia, OA and AM, for her lifelong work on behalf of women and was a nominee for Senior Australian of the Year and my brother became a gynecologist who worked into his 80s caring for women. I am sure the example of care for others so clear in Sister Santleben and my carers has been our inspiration for which we were always grateful.

Ashamed of our history

WHILST driving around the Hobart CBD last year I noticed a redevelopment of where an old building once was.
There were a couple of earthmoving machines and trucks working on site. What stood between the construction site and the busy CBD street we were on was the original facade of the building, the very same era as "The Store". The construction company had the facade all braced up and it was still 100 per cent intact and I could not see any damage to it whatsoever.
The first thing you notice when you turn off Tudor Street onto Hunter Street in Newcastle West is how the Dairy Farmers building has been extended and they kept the original front. Obviously The Store is a much larger front but there is no reason they can't keep the facade and attach it to what they wish behind, so we can keep this classic look on Hunter Street. It appears the powers that be are ashamed of our past.

Thanks to the Knights

I WOULD like to congratulate the Newcastle Knights. My wife Donna Gould had life-changing surgery last week. On Wednesday afternoon Trent Hodkinson, Nathan Ross and Brock Lamb all came and seen her in hospital as well as the Knights office sending her a beautiful bunch of flowers. Then on top of that my wife wanted to have a day pass from hospital to the game on Saturday and the doctor said she couldn't go because sitting in the wind wasn't good for her. 
The Knights office then gave her the opportunity to go to the game with an offer of one of the vacant suites. Special thanks go to Jane, Chris, Meg and all of the players and staff of the red and blue.

Stopping dirty tricks

A KEEN rugby league fan for 70 years, it has long been my contention when a player has to leave the field because of injury received in an illegal tackle the offending player should also leave with him - and not be allowed back until the injured player himself is fully recovered and able to resume playing, whether it be the same day, the next week, or six months down the track.
Then, and not before, the offending player can face the judiciary and serve whatever time off he is given for his dangerous play. If the victim can continue playing, the offender should still be automatically sin-binned and on report for his dangerous play.
No more tripping, no more swinging arm head-shots, no more late "dog" tackles from behind will make the game safer and worth watching again, that should at least help keep the bastards honest.

Supercars race waste

CONGRATULATIONS to Kath Elliot, candidate at September's local government elections, for taking a stand against the wasteful expenditure of our ever-increasing rates in Newcastle.

I understand that $10 million of our rates collected this year are being spent directly on building a race track for the Supercars event. 

This is money which was intended for projects outside the CBD, but has ended up as infrastructure for an event which will last just three days, and which may well be moved after the first year.

So after months of traffic chaos and business hardships and closures in the CBD, ratepayers in the neglected western wards may well ask why Newcastle City Council has strayed into the area of motor-racing promotion, using our money to subsidise this privately-owned race.

Community changes

DOES your local park need an upgrade? Do you need a new community hall? What would you like to see improved in your local community?

In June the NSW government handed down the biggest budget for regional NSW in the state's history. The centrepiece was the $1.3 billion Regional Growth Fund.
The Regional Growth Fund is made up of a number of separate funds. One of those funds is the Stronger Country Communities Fund, which has $200 million to invest in projects chosen by local communities. 
The Stronger Country Communities Fund is the first of its kind in regional NSW, using 'choice-modelling' to build the projects that communities want and need.
This is an exciting opportunity for residents to have their say on local amenities, and then see them get built over the next two years, ultimately improving the lives of people in the community.
The Stronger Country Communities Fund is intended to support the refurbishment or development of community facilities including libraries, parks, walking and cycle pathways, health centres, halls and playgrounds. I strongly encourage community groups to speak to their state members and councils about applications. The fund will support projects of at least $100,000, but typically in the range of $250,000 to $1 million. 
Applications for the first tranche of the fund close on August 9, 2017, so make your voice count. Visit www.industry.nsw.gov.au/invest-in-nsw/regional-opportunities/stronger-country-communities-fund
