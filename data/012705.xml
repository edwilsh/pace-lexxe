  <title>The ACT could be home to the answer for renewables question</title>
  <content>
Australia's growing supply of renewable energy could shake a question mark with a simple recipe: two reservoirs, connected by pipes on a slope.

A study by ANU researchers found nearly 6000 sites across Australia could host stations that would pump water between two reservoirs to create energy supporting the power grid during disturbances to other renewables. 
Unlike Snowy Hydro 2.0, the pumped hydro stations wouldn't need a 30km tunnel connecting the water bodies, but short, steep piping.
ANU researcher Andrew Blakers said the country needed to find sources of energy storage as states approached targets of 50 per cent renewable electricity supply. 
"We've got to think about storage several years in advance because we need to build the thing," he said. 

While Elon Musk's battery to stabilise South Australia's power supply has grabbed headlines, Professor Blakers said the smallest site his study found could yield seven times the energy storage of batteries. The largest potential station would give 1000 times more storage.
Pumped hydro avoids a restraint to the hydroelectricity that powers Tasmania. It doesn't need a river to operate, opening up much more of Australia's land mass to station sites.

In the ACT and its surrounds, researchers found 871 potential sites which together would provide about 200 times more energy storage capacity than required to support a 100 per cent renewable electricity system in the region.
Another 4800 sites in Tasmania, Queensland, South Australia and around Alice Springs could provide pumped hydro storage, and ANU researchers expect a survey of other areas will uncover about 4000 more.
The potential reservoirs were typically large enough for 5-20 hours of storage at maximum power.
A 300-metre drop between two possible reservoir sites at Naas would make it the most attractive part of the territory for a pumped hydro station, the study found. Other options included connecting Bendora and Cotter reservoirs, while nearby in NSW the Araluen Valley offered more candidates.
The study looked for sites at least 300m above nearby lower elevations where lower reservoirs would be located. Most were dry gullies near mountain tops, and on private land.
Reservoirs would need building at most sites, and governments pursuing pumped hydro would have to negotiate access with landowners. But all sites were outside national parks, Professor Blakers said.
"The potential upper reservoir sites identified would require detailed due diligence involving land ownership, engineering, hydrological, environmental and other considerations."
