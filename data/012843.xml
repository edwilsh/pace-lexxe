OUT OF THE RED: The Lead Abatement Strategy Area. Picture: NSW EPA

NORTHERN Lake Macquarie residents will be given a way to safely dump lead-laden soil, the NSW Environment Protection Authority has announced. 
Residents living the Lead Abatement Strategy Area will be eligible to dump the dirt at Newcastle City Council's Summerhill tip after the environmental body varied its licence. 

The Newcastle Herald revealed high levels of elements including lead in the Boolaroo area near the former Pasminco smelter site through . 
The residents must register to bring the dirt by calling 4908 6800 from August 14, creating a clear picture of which properties are using the system. 
There is no deadline for residents to dump their soil. 
But the dumping will not be free, with residents received a "reduced rate" after the waste levy was waived. 
More information is available on the EPA Environment Line on 131 555 or by calling Newcastle City Council on 4974 2000.
