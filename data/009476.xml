English Super League recruit Luke Dorn said he would consider coaching his hometown club in 2018 despite Maitland eyeing a third straight wooden spoon.

"I feel it's a little unfinished here at Maitland," Dorn, 35, said.

"It's been disappointing for us as a club and the area. The ground [issue] and our performances haven't been acceptable and I think Maitland deserve a little bit better.
"So I'm more than likely going to play on and I'm leaning towards having a coaching role involved. It's something I've always liked and I look forward to doing it in the future. 

"Whether that's playing and coaching I haven't decided yet, but I definitely want to help all the young boys and the club get back to where it should be."

Pickers president Frank Lawler said there has been "some good interest" in the coaching position since current mentor Trevor Ott announced last week he would step down after this season. 

Applications close on Sunday and a decision is expected by next week.
