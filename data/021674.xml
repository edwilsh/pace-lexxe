The Premier League and FA Cup winners had been locked at 1-1 following an evenly contested 90 minutes. 
Chelsea's Victor Moses opened the scoring when he reacted fastest to smash a loose ball past Petr Cech in the 46th minute. Arsenal substitute Sead Kalasinac equalised in the 82nd minute, heading home to cap an impressive performance.

Chelsea's Pedro was dismissed for a nasty lunge on Mohamed Elneny which led to Arsenal's equaliser. 
Arsenal, who beat Chelsea in May to win the FA Cup, started brightly with Alexandre Lacazette, Danny Welbeck and Alex Iwobi all having early half-chances. Arsenal's fluid front three continued to cause the Premier League champions problems.

Chelsea, who cantered to last season's league title, grew into the game and Spanish winger Pedro drew a save from Cech with a fearsome drive following a swift counter-attack.

The second half was less than a minute old when Moses, sent off in the FA Cup final defeat, reacted fastest against a static Arsenal defence to thrash home Gary Cahill's header.
In response, Courtois had to be alert to beat away a fierce, goal-bound cross from Elneny and then a rasping long-range drive from Granit Xhaka before the impressive Kolasinac, a close-season signing from Schalke 04, nodded home a deserved equaliser.Photo: AP
Morata was brought on in the closing stages and the 24-year-old headed narrowly wide late on in what would have been the perfect introduction following his summer arrival from Spanish giants Real Madrid.

Theo Walcott and Nacho Monreal scored for Arsenal before Chelsea keeper Courtois and Morata blazed high and wide respectively, leaving Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Giroud to convert in front of the jubilant Arsenal supporters.
Chelsea begin their title defence when they host Burnley on Saturday, while Arsenal entertain Leicester City on Friday to kick off the Premier League season.
