If self-belief is any indication, then the Matildas could be on the road to making quite an impact at the 2019 World Cup in France.
Alen Stajcic's squad made a resounding statement to the international football community with victory in the Tournament of Nations in the United States,  in Carson this morning (AEST).
The win over Brazil, who had knocked the Matildas out of the Rio Olympics last year via penalties in the quarter-finals,  and .
Stajcic spoke last week of the growing confidence among the Matildas squad .
He was further encouraged after the Matildas banged home six unanswered goals against a shell-shocked Brazil to complete an unbeaten campaign against three of the world's top 10 sides.
"I think that's just the belief that has grown within the team and you can't make that up, you've got to earn it and you've got to work hard for it," Stajcic told Grandstand.
"Sometimes it takes a period of time and I think over the last two to three years we've shown we can compete against the big countries."
Stajcic has shown faith in the ability of his players for some time, believing there is no reason why they cannot be the best in their position on the international stage, as well as rise above their world number seven ranking.
He just hopes they can share this feeling on the back of the victorious campaign in the US.
"We've got so many players in this team who could be the best in their position in the world," Stajcic said.
"There's no reason why we can't have the best goalkeeper in the world, the best left-back in the world."

Matildas focused on 'big three' assault

Stajcic is refusing to get carried away with the Tournament of Nations win, noting it was essentially a series of friendlies played in a round-robin format.
But he will not underestimate its importance in helping the Matildas prepare for their upcoming major assignments, the 2018 Asian Cup in Jordan, followed by the World Cup the following year and then the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.
"There's still the World Cup, the Asian Cup that lays ahead for us, and the Olympics, which really are the big three for us," Stajcic said.
"This is a great preparation tournament for those big events and laying all the platforms - technically, tactically - and with that belief and mentality.
"It was really the main objective of this week and I think we achieved it with flying colours."

The youth of the Matildas squad has impressed Stajcic as he eyes off next year's Asian Cup, as well as the World Cup, with the likes of striker Sam Kerr playing a starring role in the win over Brazil on the back of her hat-trick against Japan earlier in the week.
But veteran forward Lisa De Vanna, who scored a double against the Brazilians to become the Matildas' all-time greatest goal scorer, is also crucial to the plans to achieve a best-ever finish in France in two years' time.
"I think if you ask anyone in the team, the amount that she has changed and grown within the group and off the field has been amazing and [is] almost a complete transformation," Stajcic said.
"There is no-one who wears the shirt with more pride and passion."
The Matildas will get the opportunity to show their win over Brazil was no fluke when they host the South Americans in two matches next month, in Penrith and Newcastle.
