  <title>Student sparks Perth measles alert</title>
  <content>
A Perth school student has returned from overseas with measles, sparking a citywide health alert.
While still infectious, the student attended Perth Waldorf School in Bibra Lake after which a "substantial number" of pupils were identified as not having been vaccinated, the WA department of health said on Friday
Waldorf, which takes pre- and primary school enrolments, has a metropolitan-wide catchment area, prompting the warning for the entire Perth area.
