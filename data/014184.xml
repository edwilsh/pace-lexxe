  <title>Crown profits fall as VIPs stay away after China arrests</title>
  <content>
Profits have plunged at James Packer's Crown Resorts following a dramatic decline in revenue from wealthy VIP high rollers in the wake of the arrests and jailing of the company's staff in China.
Australia's biggest casino operator recorded net profit after tax of $343 million, down 15.5 per cent, in the 2017 financial year, it said in a sharemarket statement on Friday morning.

Crown casino bosses face jail time in China

A Chinese court sentences 19 Australian Crown Casino employees to jail for promoting gambling in the country.

Turnover from its VIP program was nearly halved, down 48.9 per cent, at $33.3 billion.
"Crown's Australian operations' full-year result reflected difficult trading conditions," executive chairman John Alexander said.

"Total normalised revenue across Crown's Australian resorts declined by 12.7 per cent. This decline was due primarily to the reduction in VIP program play revenue in Australia." 
The results were release one day after billionaire James Packer officially rejoined the company's board of directors, focussing back on its home turf after he called off ambitious plans for a global expansion.

The past year has been a difficult time for the casino and hotel empire, with the arrest and criminal convictions of its marketing staff in China, including its VIP operations head Jason O'Connor.

Crown has pulled back from its ambitions in China by selling much of its stake in joint-venture casinos in Macau and shelving plans to build a new casino in Las Vegas.
