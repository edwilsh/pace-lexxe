  <title>Pilot killed in chopper crash</title>
  <content>
A HELICOPTER pilot has been killed mustering cattle in a suspected collision with power lines in the stateâ„¢s northwest.

Cloncurry Police Senior Sergeant Brad Rix, at the crash scene 25km north of the town, said the helicopter exploded in flames on impact about 7.20am.

"We've got a single deceased male," Snr Sgt Rix said.

"He was the only one on-board and we are yet to do a formal identification.

"It is possible the chopper clipped the power lines, they are in the vicinity, we've got to get Ergon to check if there were any outages.''

The Townsville Bulletin reported the pilot was in his 40s.

Forensic units and Scenes of Crime officers from Mount Isa are heading to the site.
