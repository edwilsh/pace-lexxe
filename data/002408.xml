  <title>Broich set for more ankle surgery</title>
  <content>
FORMER Brisbane Roar star Thomas Broich needs further ankle surgery.
Just two months after having an operation on his left ankle, Broich is set to go under the knife again this week after at CT scan revealed floating bone fragments.
"When I tried to step up the intensity in my recovery it became difficult so I went for another scan, and this is the outcome," the 36-year-old two-time Johnny Warren Medallist said.
Broich, who remains a free agent, is confident of making a full recovery and being able to play again should an offer come his way.
He is also planing for his post-playing career, having recently spent time in Sydney with the Olyroos squad as an observer and in an unofficial mentoring role.
