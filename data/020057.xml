  <content>
Skiers have experienced the "best day in Australia" on Sunday after blizzards buried the Victorian Alps deep in snow over the weekend.

"We have had blizzard conditions," Ms Trembath said.

"It is shaping up to be the snow of the season."
She said conditions had been tough on Sunday, both "windy and snowing", but punters had still hit the slopes.

"[For] the actual ski and snow-boarding conditions, I think some people have been saying, [it is the] 'best day in Australia for a very long time'.

However, the storm brought down a tree, which hit a power line, bringing it down and closing the road to Falls Creek in both directions.
Falls Creek Resort Management, marketing manager Jo Prophero said the wind and lightening warnings shut the mountain in the later part of Sunday.
"We probably had more than 40 centimetres of snow since Friday," Ms Prophero said.
Mount Buller Ski Lifts spokeswoman Rhylla Morgan said the skiers had been out in force on Sunday, but a lightning warning caused some of the upper mountains lifts to close. 
But she said twilight skiing in the village was still going ahead as planned. 
"Between 6am and 12pm, we had 15 centimetres of snow," Ms Morgan said.
"The snow is continuing to fall."
