Newcastle District Cricket Association inducted former Test players John Watkins and Paul Wilson as life members at its annual general meeting on Tuesday night.

Watkins, a leg spinner from Hamilton, was picked for Australia against Pakistan at the SCG in 1973 despite having just five first-class games under his belt. His teammates included Ian and Greg Chappell, Doug Walters, Rod Marsh, Max Walker and Dennis Lillee.

Watkins did not take a wicket in six overs in the first innings and was not required when Lillee and Walker routed Pakistan for 106 in the second innings to win by 52 runs.

But he made a career-best 36 in the second innings and shared a match-winning stand of 86 for the ninth wicket with Bob Massie.

It turned out to be his only Test, although the now 74-year-old toured the West Indies the following year. 

Paceman Wilson was also wicketless in his only Test, against India in Kolkata in 1988, although Australia took only five wickets in a heavy innings defeat.

"Blocker", now 45, has forged a successful umpiring career since retiring as a player.
The NDCA named Sydney Business Chamber executive director, Cricket NSW board member and former NSW Upper House Liberal MP Patricia Forsythe as its patron.
The 65-year-old Novocastrian is a member of the well known Wingrove cricketing and baseball family.

NDCA chairman Paul Marjoribanks was re-elected unopposed for an 11th season, and Wests all-rounder Joe Price and first-grade umpire Graeme Bruce joined the board in place of Paul Robertson and David Redden, neither of whom sought re-election.

The association also presented Waratah stalwart Steve Christie with its Contribution to the Game award.
