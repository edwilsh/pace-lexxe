  <title>'Underrated horse' carries Clarke's sprint hopes</title>
  <content>
IT has been an eventful week in the Gary Clarke stable, but you would still be a brave punter to not tip any of the champion Darwin trainer's horses in the $135,000 Palmerston Sprint at Fannie Bay today.
Clarke had high hopes for King's Pardon before the eight-year-old was scratched when a vet check revealed lameness in his near hind leg on Thursday.
"He's an underrated horse. I had him a couple of years ago in Alice Springs leading into the Pioneer Sprint and first up he won brilliantly," Clarke said earlier in the week before the vet check.
"He started favourite in the Pioneer Sprint, and each year his first-up run has been his best. So this year we decided first up for the Palmerston."
Despite the setback, Clarke still has Ticket To Toorak, Captain Punch and Boomwa running in today's sprint feature over 1200m.
Seven-year-old Ticket To Toorak carries two consecutive wins into today's race after saluting in the Ladbrokes Bernborough Club Cup (1000m) on June 24, and the Coates Hire Weight for Age (1200m) on July 22.
"Ticket To Toorak is very honest. He'll probably have a bit of weight (and will carry 60.5kg today)," Clarke said.
Stable jockey Brendon Davis will be aboard Ticket To Toorak before he serves his one-meeting suspension for careless riding. Davis will miss Monday's Darwin Cup meeting after he was listed to ride Sheila Arnold's Billet Doux.
The talk last night was that Stephen Ridler was set to fill that void. Riding Clarke's Marbel Duke in race two on Wednesday, Davis permitted his mount to shift inward when not clear approaching the 550 mark.
Your Excellency (Tayarn Halter) and Jackanory (Dick Leech) were also scratched from today's race, with the trainers instead opting to start them on Monday (race two over 1000m for Your Excellency and race three over 1200m for Jackanory).
