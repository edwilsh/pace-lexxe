  <title>MPs unite to demand judge probe water 'theft'</title>
  <content>
SOUTH Australia's state and federal MPs from across the political spectrum have joined forces in support of the River Murray, demanding a judicial inquiry.
Premier Jay Weatherill and Water Minister Ian Hunter were joined on Monday by senators from four parties - NXT leader Nick Xenophon, Labor's Penny Wong, the Greens' Sarah Hanson-Young and Australian Conservatives leader Cory Bernardi.
All are calling for a , after it was revealed last week that cotton farmers upstream had been illegally sucking water out of the river.
Premier Jay Weatherill said it was needed because the allegations "goes to the heart of the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin agreement".
"That's why we're standing here together, the Labor Party, the Conservatives, the Greens, the Nick Xenophon party," he said.
Senator Wong will move a motion in Parliament expressing support for the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and concern over the allegations of theft raised last week by ABC show Four Corners.
Senator Wong said she had a message for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull - "you can't hide when it comes to the River Murray".
Senator Bernardi said a healthy Murray-Darling Basin was important for the nation's prosperity.
"We need to make sure the entire agreement is being upheld, that the processes are upheld with integrity and transparency," he said.
The group was also joined by NSW farmer Robert McBride from Broken Hill, and the Murray's lowest irrigator, Sam Dodd from Meningie.

The Turnbull government has ordered an independent review of water usage in the Murray Darling Basin.
