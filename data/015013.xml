  <content>
NBN Co has lured the head of Nokia's Australia and New Zealand operations to become its new chief technology officer.

The CTO role has been vacant since May when an  saw Dennis Steiger leave the organisation.

At the time the network builder indicated the CTO functions had been absorbed into the role of executive general manager of future tech and architecture, held by Tom Roets. NBN Co has been contacted for clarification.

Ray Owen will join NBN Co from his current position as managing director of Nokia's Oceania region, a role he has held for several years.

Owen worked in various executive positions at Motorola before joining Nokia in April 2011.

He will report into NBN Co's chief strategy officer JB Rousselot.

"We are delighted to welcome Ray to NBN Co and look forward to his vast experience in the global telecoms industry in helping us deliver the best possible network for Australians," Rousselot said in a statement.
