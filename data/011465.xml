JAZZ Dior, the sister of ex Nomads bikie gang boss Sam Ibrahim, has been sentenced to 18 months for conspiring to supply firearms to a former rock band drummer, but will avoid prison.
Wearing five-inch black stilettos, her face heavily made up and her long dark hair braided in corn rows, Dior smiled broadly as District Court Judge Robert Toner passed sentence.
Judge Toner said Dior, who changed her name from Maha Sayour in 2013, would serve the sentence by way of an intensive corrections order.
Dior, 47, and her former partner Elvis Mileski, 45, very briefly acknowledged each other on Thursday as they sat in the dock of the court together for sentencing.
The former couple had pleaded guilty conspiring to unlawfully supply firearms from their suburban car wash business with Sam Ibrahim and former Rose Tattoo drummer Paul DeMarco.
Dior and Hassan "Sam" Ibrahim are the siblings of Kings Cross nightclub identity John Ibrahim.

But the weapons plot unravelled when DeMarco tried to sell a box of Glock pistols to an undercover police officer.
The former rock musician, whose wife testified had become "grey, bloated, dishevelled" from ice addiction, is serving a minimum six years in prison for gun supply.
According to an agreed statement of facts, phone taps captured Mileski negotiating to obtain firearms and onsell them with Dior's help between January and March 2014.

The couple were arrested in April 2014 after police raided DeMarco's Windsor house and the
the couple's Clear View Hand Car Wash at Warilla, south of Sydney.

At the time of the raids, police said they seized 18 weapons, including an M1 military-grade assault rifle, a standard rifle, three pistols, two shotguns and 11 handguns.
A February 2014 phone tap picked up Mileski telling Dior that he needed another $23,000 on top of the $10,000 he had for six "brand new things, in the boxes", meaning firearms.
He told Dior the price of each was "five and a half" and he'd already "knocked off 15K on the deal".
"They're not what he asked for," Mileski said in the call, but they were the same as "those first ones ... the personal ones".
"We'll sell them for whatever you want. Either he'll give us something or just put f---ing 6 1/2 on them."
Mileski was heard saying he needed to hire a car to pick up the goods rather than use his and Dior's car, because he didn't want to take risks.

In another recorded conversation, the undercover officer asked DeMarco whether a "box of 10 coming" were from "your mate Sam?".
"Yep, but don't say anything," DeMarco responded.
When there were delays in sourcing the firearms, DeMarco told the officer: "I just spoke to him about 20 minutes ago ... and I'm gunna meet him over at my mate's place to find out what's goin' on."
"I, you can't do anything till it gets here ... What do I say today if it's not here? I'll say, Sam, you're making me look like a f---in' idiot."
Later phone intercepts captured the couple discussing when Mileski planned to pick up the firearms.
Judge Toner also sentenced Mileski to an 18 months intensive corrections order.
Last November, Sam Ibrahim pleaded guilty to conspiring to supply guns as part of the racket with his sister.
In one phone call with Dior, who is his youngest sister, Ibrahim said: "You know how you told me about that thing before ... Get the lot ... Tell them, tell them we'll buy all of it ... 'cause you know what? You can use them for your car wash."
He is due to be sentenced in September.
