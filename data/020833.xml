  <content>
A NSW restaurant owner has been repeatedly struck with a weapon when a would-be robber discovered there wasn't any cash on the premises.
The incident occurred about 7.45pm on Sunday when the 63-year-old man closed his business on Tongarra Road, Albion Park.
He was approached by a man who demanded cash. When told there wasn't any, the man struck the restaurateur a number of times across the head with a weapon.
The victim was taken to Wollongong Hospital where he was treated for deep lacerations on his head.
