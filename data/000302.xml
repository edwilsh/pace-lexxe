Nico Hulkenberg confronts Kevin Magnussen

Turn two at the Hungarian Grand Prix is apparently the primary antagonist in the Formula One world, wreaking havoc on Sunday.
After , it later caused even more tension between Nico Hulkenberg and Kevin Magnussen.
While Verstappen and Ricciardo can talk things through in the garage and maybe come to an understanding, things were less grown up - but infinitely more "adult" - between the European competitors.
Renault's Hulkenberg and Haas Ferrari's Magnussen were in a battle for 11th, when Hulkenberg attempted to sneak past Magnussen on the outside of the corner.
The Dane pushed wide and ran Hulkenberg off the track, prompting the furious German to confront Magnussen while the latter was live on television.

Kevin Magnussen goes wide, pushing Nico Hulkenberg onto the grass.
Magnussen was chatting to European broadcaster ViaSat when Hulkenberg sarcastically congratulated him for being "once again the most unsporting driver on the grid".
Apparently, Magnussen did not appreciate it.
"Suck my balls, mate," he replied.
After the brief (but very pointed) confrontation, Hulkenberg told reporters he thought Magnussen was a dirty driver.
"When it comes to racing, he's just nasty. Hard defending is fine but what he does is just ruthless," he said.
"Sending people into the wall and what he did there, opening up the steering and making me run wide, it's just being an arsehole basically."
Magnussen also had a bone to pick with Hulkenberg over an earlier incident in which the latter clashed tyres with Magnussen's Haas team-mate Romain Grosjean.
After the collision, Magnussen said over the radio: "If you can do what Hulkenberg did to Romain, it's going to be a dirty race."
Grosjean and Hulkenberg both failed to finish the race, while Magnussen finished 11th before being docked five seconds for his run-in with Hulkenberg, dropping him to 13th.
