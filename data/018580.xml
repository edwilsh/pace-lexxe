Cameron: 'I hit an innocent wall'
Leon Cameron admitted he let emotions get the better of him after punching a wall during his side's comfortable win over Melbourne

Shane Mumford and Max Gawn 'had an outstanding duel', according to the Giants coach

GREATER Western Sydney could be without No.1 big man after Shane Mumford for next Friday's crucial clash with the Western Bulldogs, with the Match Review Panel sure to scrutinise two incidents from Saturday's win over Melbourne.

Mumford dumped debutant Corey Maynard with a bruising tackle that saw the Demon's head bounce off the cricket pitch area in the middle of the ground in the first quarter, which resulted in the Demon receiving a free kick.

In the Giant's favour was that Maynard got straight up to take his free kick, so he might escape with a financial sanction or less.

Of more concern for Mumford was a crude bump to the head of Max Gawn in the third quarter.

Gawn wasn't even given a free kick after Mumford dropped him with a right shoulder to the jaw, but while the 2016 All Australian lay on the ground for several seconds after the hit and looked groggy when he struggled to his feet, he also played out the match.

After his side's 35-point in Canberra, Giants coach Leon Cameron said he hadn't seen replays of the incidents so was hesitant to comment on a potential suspension. 

"I probably get asked something like that every time Shane plays," he said. 

"What I will say is that it was fantastic having him (back) at his aggressive best. 

"I thought Gawn and Mumford had an outstanding duel, yes Gawn kicked a goal early but 'Mummy's' inside work was terrific, and we need him playing in that aggressive manner. 

"I'll look at the game and see where it sits but I prefer him to play on edge like he did, and hopefully he should be fine." 

While Mumford appears certain to cop some kind of ban over the Gawn bump, Cameron said he was confident that Dawson Simpson was ready to again fill in for his main man against the premiers. 

Shane Mumford and Max Gawn collided in this incident.

Simpson was in good touch when called into the side to replace an injured Mumford against Fremantle last week.

"Obviously that's subjective in terms of Mumford's availability, but Dawson was unlucky to come out of the side (this week)," he said. 

"He played some really good footy (against Fremantle), he's got great spirit and great heart, which is exactly what we need.

"I hope I don't have to make that decision but if it happens, then Dawson Simpson is a perfect replacement."

Cameron confirmed that suspended forward Toby Greene would be an automatic inclusion against the Bulldogs next week, with key forward Jonathon Patton also a big chance to be fit after he pulled out of the Demons game with hamstring soreness on Friday.
