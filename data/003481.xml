  <title>Markets Live: Aussie jumps as RBA meets</title>
  <content>
The Dow Jones hit a record high on Wall Street overnight, helped by Boeing, while selling in Facebook, Alphabet and other technology companies kept the S&P 500 flat and pulled the Nasdaq lower.

The S&P 500 information technology dipped 0.5 per cent, with Facebook falling 1.8 per cent and Alphabet , Google's parent company, down 1.4 per cent.

"The bull market is sort of broadening out and people are taking a few profits off the table on some these stocks that have done exceedingly well," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.

Boeing rose 1 per cent and hit a record high of $US243.60 after JPMorgan raised its price target on the world's biggest plane maker to $US280. The stock was the largest contributor to the Dow's gains.

Apple, which is expected to report quarterly results after market close on Tuesday, dipped 0.6 per cent.

Investors have been counting on earnings to support high valuations for equities.

S&P 500 earnings are expected on average to have grown 10.8 per cent in the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

"We're probably seeing peak earnings," said Ed Keon, portfolio manager at QMA, a multi-asset manager in Newark, New Jersey. "I think we'll be a little slower in the second half."

The Dow Jones added 0.3 per cent while the S&P 500 slipped 0.1 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.4 per cent.

The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, jumped 1.5 per cent to a reading of 110.2.

Snap fell 2.5 per cent as some investors were allowed for the first time to sell shares following the Snapchat owner's March initial public offer.

Discovery Communications dropped 8.8 per cent after it said it would buy Scripps Networks Interactive for $11.9 billion.
