A huge party at an abandoned Dandenong house spiralled out of control, erupting into street fights and armed robbery, police said.
Eight police units were required to clear more than 100 youths from Heatherton Rd during the wild event on July 28.
Dandenong Police detective Senior Constable Liam Comrie said police received numerous reports of fighting in the street and responded at 11pm to find the large crowd of youths.
Sen-Constable Comrie said a 17-year-old Cranbourne boy approached officers on the night and said he had been robbed at knifepoint with his wallet and phone taken.
An 18-year-old Springvale man has been arrested and charged with armed robbery but police believe there could have been more offenders and more victims.
Sen-Constable Comrie called for any victims or witnesses to come forward and contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
