  <title>NSW mum tells of grief over son's murder</title>
  <content>
The grieving mother of a well-known NSW Central Coast custom car builder shot dead in his ute three years ago says she has had to recognise the existence of evil for the first time in her life.
Dr Julia Starling also spoke of never being able to forget that her 29-year-old son Laurie Starling "spent the last precious moments of his life in absolute fear and terror, in the dark and totally defenceless".
Her victim impact statement was tendered at the NSW Supreme Court sentence hearing for bikie John Richard Weston, 37, who was found guilty in March of murdering Mr Starling outside his West Gosford car restoration shop in July 2014.
Fellow member of the Rebels OMCG Timothy Steven Rolfe, 32, pleaded guilty to the murder in February.
