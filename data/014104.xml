  <title>Mine owner's history sparks serious concerns for proposal</title>
  <content>
IT IS entirely understandable Scott Sawyer is conflicted over the conditions offered to and accepted by the Adani mine owners (Daily, August 2).
It is their history which is concerning - the Australian CEO was in charge when the copper mine in Africa discharged its contents into the Zambian River, for example.
I disagree with the statement "both sides of government seem hell-bent in providing this mine with the smoothest passage possible" - after seven years of argy-bargy?
Hardly an advertisement for "smooth" sailing.
The government has put in place terms and conditions relative to the mine's use and hopefully to the methods by which extraction and waste will be handled ethically.
Like it or not, ex-Senator Canavan was a "conduit" to government - isn't that what MPs are expected to be after consultation with their constituents?
Perhaps, Scott, there is a quid pro quo in place to the government/s, unknown to we plebs, among which could even be considered as buying votes for the next election (shock, horror).
