  <title>Qantas flights QF7, QF63 return to Sydney after separate issues</title>
  <content>
Two Qantas long-haul aircraft have been forced to return to Sydney after they suffered separate issues just hours into their flights.
QF63, a Boeing 747-400 jumbo on its way to Johannesburg in South Africa, departed Sydney just before 11am on Friday and got to Tasmania before it turned back.Photo: Twitter: Flightradar24
QF7, an A380 heading to Dallas in the United States, departed at 1.40pm and turned around shortly after, circling over the ocean east of Wollongong.Photo: Twitter: Flightradar24
It is understood the 747 has suffered a cracked cockpit windscreen. It landed safely at Sydney Airport shortly before 3.30pm.
The A380 has an issue retracting its wing flaps, which is not regarded as serious but would have caused the plane to burn significantly more fuel on the long-haul flight.

In a statement, Qantas said the "mechanical issue" with the A380 would mean "the aircraft can't fly efficiently".

"As the Dallas flight is our longest on the network, the captain made the decision to return to Sydney," a spokesperson said.
"The aircraft is expected to land at around 4pm Sydney time where it will be inspected by engineers."
The spokesperson said all passengers would be accommodated or offered transport home before replacement services are organised.
