Mr Jordan said details throughout the home were completely finished in every way.
"You won't be able to find another house like this," Mr Jordan said.
"The house was left in a way so that the new owners had nothing to do - just walk in."
The property, on a 658sq m block, is situated in an exclusive ridgetop enclave.
Schools, shops and transport are nearby as is Indooroopilly Golf Course and St Lucia Golf Links.
