  <title>Horror highway motorbike crash: What witnesses saw</title>
  <content>
A MAN who stopped to help after a horror crash that left a motorcyclist fighting for his life has spoken about the shocking scene that confronted him.

Dave Cramer had only just entered the M1 motorway at the southbound Bermuda St exit on Wednesday evening when he heard a "loud bang" behind him.

The Palm Beach resident said he was probably three cars in front of the crash when he saw a black Harley Davidson motorbike - minus its rider - overtake him on the left hand side, before crashing into a fence.

Mr Cramer said he looked back in his rear view mirror to see the injured rider lying on the ground on the left side of the road and pulled over to help.

"I was probably the first to go up to him, I tried his pulse," Mr Cramer said.
