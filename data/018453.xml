  <title>VIDEO: Kanga KO'd, Grundy in strife?</title>

COLLINGWOOD big man Brodie Grundy looks set for a MRP-enforced holiday after a horror tackle on Kangaroo Ben Brown.
Late in the second quarter at Etihad Stadium, Brown gathered the ball on centre wing and was immediately set upon by Grundy.

However, it went wrong for the Magpies ruckman when he slammed Brown into the turf with his arms pinned.
Brown's head made heavy contact with the ground and he appeared to be knocked out in the incident.
North Melbourne trainers were quickly by his side and a stretcher was called for.
In a positive sign, Brown gave fans the thumbs up as he left the ground.
After the highly-publicised Patrick Dangerfield case last week, Grundy's fate looks a fait accompli with at least one week on the sidelines.
Former Tribunal member Daniel Harford likened it to the incident which got Patrick Dangerfield suspended last week but he said Grundy's tackle looked better than Dangerfield's.
"He's got the ball for the majority of the tackle," Harford said on 3AW.
"It's much more of a football action. It was less unreasonable in the circumstances."
Kangaroos captain Jack Ziebell could also come under scrutiny for a tackle on Magpies star Adam Treloar. However, Treloar managed to get an arm free and returned to the action.
