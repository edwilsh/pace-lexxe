  <title>US diplomats locked out of Russia sites</title>
  <content>
The US embassy in Moscow is accusing Russian authorities of barring diplomatic staff from a property on the outskirts of Moscow, after having earlier granted access for them to retrieve belongings.
The Russian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Staff on Monday said they had been given until midday on Tuesday to clear the building out.
The property, in a picturesque spot on a bend in the Moskva river north-west of the Russian capital, is leased by the US embassy for its staff to use for recreation.
Moscow has said it is taking it back as part of retaliatory measures after Washington approved a fresh round of sanctions against Russia.
A Reuters TV cameraman outside the country residence, known in Russian as a dacha, saw five vehicles with diplomatic license plates, including a truck, arrive at the site. He said they were denied entry.
An embassy spokeswoman said: "In line with the Russian government notification, the US Mission to Russia was supposed to have access to our dacha until noon on August 1.
