  <title>Michael Hooper named Wallabies captain in place of Stephen Moore in Bledisloe Cup build-up</title>

Michael Hooper will need to prove the doubters wrong after being appointed Wallabies captain in place of Stephen Moore ahead of the opening Bledisloe Cup Test later this month.
The announcement, , came as no surprise, as Hooper has skippered the Wallabies on several occasions since 2014.
His appointment, while approved by coach Michael Cheika, will not necessarily be a popular choice, with a growing number of Wallabies supporters unimpressed with his leadership when he has captained the national team.
Hooper's decision-making has often come under fire, , but the fact the Wallabies squad is hardly bursting with candidates for skipper meant the 25-year-old's ascension to the role in an official capacity was a mere formality.
Hooper made his Test debut against Scotland in a break-out 2012 season and has since registered 68 caps for the Wallabies.

The openside flanker first captained the Wallabies in a Test match in 2014 - becoming the 82nd player to do so - after Moore sustained a season-ending knee injury in their opening match of the year against France.
Hooper has captained New South Wales since 2016 but led the Waratahs to the Super Rugby Championship two years earlier when regular skipper Dave Dennis was sidelined with a knee injury.
He will lead the Wallabies out against All Blacks in the first of three Bledisloe Cup fixtures in Sydney on August 19, the Test doubling as the Rugby Championship opener.
More to come.
