  <title>Baby whale beached on Moreton Island</title>
  <content>
A baby humpback whale has become beached on Moreton Island off the coast of Brisbane.
Ranger in charge Terry Christensen said the baby whale, which is about four metres long, became beached at Bulwer Wrecks on the north-western side of the island at about midday.
Rangers and Marine Parks staff are keeping the whale cool and wet until the tide comes in enough to refloat it.
