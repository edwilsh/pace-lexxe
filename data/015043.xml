  <title>Inside mail: Big bets and market movers</title>
  <content>
TWO-TIME Melbourne Cup winner Kerrin McEvoy has the best book of rides of other jockey at Royal Randwick on Saturday, with only two of his nine mounts at double-figure odds.
McEvoy has started the new season in the same sort of form that saw him bag nine Group 1 wins during an outstanding 2016/17 campaign.
RACE WATCH:
HOT TIPS:
He booted home a double at Warwick Farm on Wednesday but could easily top that feat at HQ.
McEvoy reunites with Missile Stakes hopeful Tycoon Tara ($4.80) for the first time since they combined to take out the Group 1 Tatt's Tiara at Doomben in June.
Three of McEvoy's rides are for Chris Waller, including last-start winner Sayed ($2.70).
Those Waller/McEvoy fans looking for a bit more value should look no further than the enigmatic Dubaiinstyle ($10) who was held up at a crucial time at his last start only getting out when the race was all over.
Meanwhile, a majority of punters are expecting a bold first-up bid from the speedy Tango Rain ($2.90) when he resumes in the TAB.com.au Handicap (1000m).
The Gerald Ryan-trained son of Manhattan Rain finished second to Star Turn in the Group 3 San Domenico Stakes (1100m) last preparation.TAB BIG BETS
Race 1: Brave Song has been well backed on TAB Fixed Odds, firming from $4-$3.20 with bets including $1000 at $4, $300 at $4, $1050 at $3.60, $1000 at $3.20 and $500 at $3.20. Addictive Nature, who is $15 to win the Golden Rose, is $2.30 out to $2.40, one punter has $600 on at $2.30.
Race 2: The Chris Waller-trained Diapason, a daughter of Melbourne Cup winner Shocking, is unchanged at $4.80, despite bets of $980 at $4.80 and $200 at the same quote.
Race 4: In-form galloper Gitan is $7. One punter has had $700 on at that quote.
Race 5: Impressive last-start winner Sayed is rock-solid in betting, $2.80-$2.70, with bets of $500 at $2.80 and $200 also at $2.80.
Race 6: Invincible Knight is out slightly to $3.20 after opening at $3.10, while Steyne (unlucky last start) is hovering around the $4.40-$4.60 mark with bets of $750 at $4.60, $500 at $4.40 and $250 at $4.40.
Race 7: Since final field, Le Romain is $2.30-$2.15-$2.20, with one bet of $1000 at $2.20, mudlark Jungle Edge is $7-$6-$6.50, while last-start G1 winner Tycoon Tara is $5 into $4.80.
Race 8: Tango Rain is one of the best supported horses on TAB Fxed Odds, firming from $3.80-$2.90 with bets of $400 at $3.80, $625 at $3.20.
Race 9: Kings Of Leon is unchanged at $9, $100 at $9, $200 e/w at $9/$3.05, Spending To Win is $7 into $5, $250 x $200 e/w at $7, $250 at $6, $300 at $5 and $250 at $5.THE BEST BARRIERS

Solar Patch (race one) has always been a nice colt but he might be an ever better gelding! His acceleration when winning first-up at Gosford was awesome. Big step up but he's got a black-type future and is $10.TRIAL POINTERS
Gitan (race four) is a consistent chestnut gelding trained at Goulburn by Jean Dubois. He won first-up Kembla, had a break and a trial before his third to Awoke at Canterbury on July 12. Gitan trialled at Warwick Farm on July 28 and was the eye-catcher in the heat, finishing an easy third over 1200m. Has won on heavy.
Denpurr (race nine) is a Team Snowden/Triple Crown Syndicate mare resuming. The daughter of Denman has won three of her six fresh run and is 3s 2w at the track and distance. Denpurr has trialled twice for this, winning her July 18 heat at Rosehill, where she finished all over the top of her rivals to win in impressive style.WORK WHISPERS
Invincible Gem (race seven) was spelled after her narrow second in the G1 Randwick Guineas in the autumn and resumes in the Missile Stakes. The Kris Lees-trained mare has been trialling exceedingly well and looked sharp in her work. She galloped over 800m with stablemate and Missile rival Le Romain over 800m at Newcastle on Tuesday timed in a leisurely 55.75, last 600m in an unhurried 39.80.
Pro Consul (race eight) turned eight on Monday but he's been racing like a horse half his age since he made the move to Greg Hickman's Warwick Farm stable. The son of Reset is getting closer to a win with every run. Pro Consul worked over 1000m on the WF Pro Ride on Tuesday in 1:12.85s, last 400m in 27.32 and home the last 200m on 12.19s with plenty in reserve.BEST BET
Sayed (race five) is a last-start winner from the Chris Waller camp and was very strong at the end of 2400m. He's been back to the trials to keep him ticking over, and he excels on soft/heavy tracks. Backed in to $2.70, which is understandable; he's going super.EACH-WAY
Alluvion (race nine) was unlucky at Warwick Farm two runs back in a deep form race then ran on noticeably at Rosehill last weekend. Third-up, backing-up, won on soft and drops 8kg, albeit into a tougher race. Good value at $19 on TAB Fixed Odds.
THE JUDGMENTROYAL RANDWICK
R7: MISSILE STAKES (1200m)
Paul Snowden (co-trainer) Tycoon Tara: "She has got very good residual fitness going into this and the sting is definitely going to be out of the track and that's very good for her. She will tick a few boxes on Saturday.''
Glenn Munsie (TAB): "Class runner Le Romain looks the one to beat at WFA. Resumes in this with a solid first-up record and should see the field break up with Jungle Edge, Memes and The Monstar all wanting to roll along with Tycoon Tara, That's A Good Idea and Boss Lane all handy. Only missed a place once from eight starts on wet and trialled twice to ready him. Jungle Edge has to be respected on wet.''
Grant Palmer (bookie): "Race looks the perfect set-up for Le Romain, sits just off a hot speed, gets a wet track and he flies fresh. Small save on The Monstar, who is racing in terrific order, and will appreciate the soft conditions.''
Blake Johnston (bookie): "Invincible Gem has trialled well in preparation for this and looks a horse on the up. She can race off the speed and represents some value.''
Terry Kennedy (Sky Sports Radio): "Sticking with Tatt's Tiara winner Tycoon Tara, she has residual fitness, should get the run of the race and has won on a heavy surface. Invincible Gem looks primed for a bold showing judging by her Newcastle trial."
Verdict: TYCOON TARA
R8: TAB.COM.AU HCP (1000m)
Gerald Ryan (trainer) Tango Rain: "He has definitely got the ability to be a stakes horse if he races OK and if he hasn't taken any ill effects from the virus. He is bright and well in himself and he is working good.''
Glenn Munsie (TAB): "Happy to look away from the two favs (Tango Rain and Launch Code) because of their odds. Beau Tirage and Realise Potential resume, with the former a real 1000m specialist in my mind. Handles ground and well overs at present ($17). Realise Potential's last two starts before a break were over 1000m and they saw better efforts than most of his others. Slight concerns on heavy [track] though.''
Grant Palmer (bookie): "Have a strong opinion on Launch Code who bounced back into the winner's circle last start and expect he can go through the grades. Happy to risk Tango Rain first-up in a year from the wide gate on a testing track.''
Blake Johnston (bookie): "Launch Code really attacked the line at Wyong after a disappointing effort in town. He looks back to his best and will prove hard to beat.''
Terry Kennedy (Sky Sports Radio): "Like a Randwick specialist here at big odds in Salerno, who's coming off two good wins at track and distance. Don't dismiss Cudabeen who was brave last start but just found one better. ''
Verdict: LAUNCH CODE
R9: SCHWEPPES HCP (1200m)
Matthew Smith (trainer) Kings Of Leon: "I'd be thinking about riding him conservatively from the barrier but I wouldn't be afraid to push forward with him.''
Glenn Munsie (TAB): "Thought Mana was great value as a $15 chance. Midweek winner twice and solid Saturday runs but his strength at 1200m is why I have to have him on top. A number of these may just be found wanting at the end of 1200m so want a strong runner for me. Argent D'or and Ghostly are the others that fall into that category as well.''
Grant Palmer (bookie): "Happy to stick with Kings Of Leon who has won four of his past five and keeps getting the job done. Barrier shouldn't be too much of an issue as he will get back and we expect them to be looking for the outside come the later races.''
Blake Johnston (bookie): "Dual acceptor Clipper chooses the last race and it could prove a winning move. She should be able to cross from the outside and represents value.''
Terry Kennedy (Sky Sports Radio): "Was keen on Spending To Win, but the track now worries me. Settled on Clipper trained by Matthew Dale, was a dual acceptor, is rock-hard fit and gets through the ground."
Verdict: CLIPPER
