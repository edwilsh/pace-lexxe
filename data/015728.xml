  <title>Libs to pick Frankston candidate</title>
  <content>
THREE candidates are seeking Liberal Party preselection for the ultra marginal seat of Frankston.
Former mayor Darrel Taylor, senior police officer Michael Lamb and financial consultant Alex Screen confirmed they had nominated for preselection, but declined to comment further.
Mr Taylor served as a Frankston councillor during the tumultuous 2012-2016 term, which was marked by bitter infighting.
Mr Lamb is a Senior Sergeant based at Frankston Police Station.
An online profile stated that Mr Screen worked in education, industrial science, and manufacturing prior to financial planning.
Branch members will vote for a new candidate at a meeting soon.
Labor MP Paul Edbrooke holds the seat with a margin of 0.48 per cent.
He would not comment on the Liberal Party preselection or the candidates standing.
The next state election will be held on November 24, 2018.
