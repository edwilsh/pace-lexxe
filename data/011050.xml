  <title>Human embryo 'edited' to correct gene for heart condition</title>
  <content>
In a move that is being met with both excitement and concern, scientists have successfully edited the DNA of human embryos to erase an inheritable heart condition known for causing sudden death in young competitive athletes.
The development, which opens the door to a controversial new era in medicine, has prompted calls for guidance on what should or should not be allowed.

First human embryos edited in US

In a controversial step toward someday helping babies avoid inherited diseases, scientists in the US have edited the genes of human embryos.

This is the first time gene editing on human embryos has been conducted in the United States, although previous gene editing studies have been conducted in China.
The US researchers said in interviews this week that they consider their work very basic. The embryos were allowed to grow for only a few days, and there was never any intention to implant them to create a pregnancy. But they also acknowledged that they will continue to move forward with the science, with the ultimate goal of being able to "correct" disease-causing genes in embryos that will develop into babies.Photo: OHSU
News of the experiment began to circulate last week, but details became public on Wednesday with a paper in the journal Nature.
The experiment is the latest example of how the laboratory tool known as CRISPR (or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats), a type of "molecular scissors," is pushing the boundaries of our ability to manipulate life.

The most recent work is particularly sensitive because it involves changes to the germ line, genes that could be passed on to future generations.

Shoukhrat Mitalipov, one of the lead authors of the paper and a researcher at Oregon Health & Science University, said he is conscious of the need for a larger ethical and legal discussion about genetic modification of humans but that his team's work is justified because it involves "correcting" genes rather than changing them.
"Really we didn't edit anything. Neither did we modify anything," Mitalipov said. "Our program is toward correcting mutant genes."
Alta Charo, a bioethicist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison who is co-chair of the National Academies committee looking at gene editing, said recent concerns about the work are overblown.
"What this represents is a fascinating, important and rather impressive incremental step toward learning how to edit embryos safely and precisely," she said. However, "no matter what anybody says, this is not the dawn of the era of the designer baby."
She said characteristics that some parents might desire, such as intelligence and athleticism, are influenced by multiple genes and researchers don't understand all the components of how such characteristics are inherited, much less how to redesign them.
The research involved eggs from 12 healthy female donors and sperm from a male volunteer who carries the MYBPC3 gene, which causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. HCM is a disease that causes an abnormal thickening of the heart muscle but can cause no symptoms and remain undetected until it causes sudden cardiac death. There's no way to prevent or cure it, and it affects 1 in 500 people worldwide.
Around the time the sperm was injected into the eggs, researchers snipped out the gene that causes the disease. The result was far more successful than the researchers expected: as the embryo's cells began to divide and multiply, a huge number appeared to be repairing themselves by using the normal, non-mutated copy of the gene from the women's genetic material. In all, they saw about 72 per cent were corrected, a very high number.
Researchers also noticed there didn't seem to be any "off-target" changes in the DNA, which has been a major safety concern of gene-editing research.
Dr Mitalipov said he hoped the technique could one day be applied to a wide variety of genetic diseases and one of the team's next targets may be the BRCA gene mutation, which is associated with breast cancer.
The first published work involving human embryos, reported in 2015, was done in China and targeted a gene that leads to the blood disorder beta thalassaemia. But those embryos were abnormal and non-viable, and there were far fewer than the number used in the US study.
Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a researcher at the Salk Institute who is also a co-author on the new study, said that there are many advantages to treating an embryo rather than a child or an adult. When dealing with an embryo in its earliest stages, only a few cells are involved, while in a more mature human being there are trillions of cells in the body and potentially millions that must be corrected to eradicate traces of a disease.
For years, some policymakers, historians and scientists have been calling for a voluntary moratorium on the modification of the DNA of human reproductive cells. The most prominent expression of concern came in the form of a 2015 letter signed by CRISPR co-inventor Jennifer Doudna, Nobel laureate David Baltimore and 16 other prominent scientists. They warned that eliminating a genetic disease could have future unintended consequences, on human genetics, society and even the environment.
Dr Mitalipov said he hopes regulators will provide more guidance on what should or should not be allowed.
Otherwise, he said, "This technology will be shifted to unregulated areas, which shouldn't be happening."
