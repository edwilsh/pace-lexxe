Eight days later, they were called to a second fire at the building, this one causing significant structural damage.
Police believe the fires were deliberately lit and have released CCTV footage of two people inside the centre on Boxing Day and an image of a black XR-model Ford utility seen in the area at the time of the fire.

The building is owned by a company called Redpoc, whose directors are Eddie Obeid's long-time friend and former business partner Wally Wehbe and Eddie Obeid's son Paul Obeid. 
The building is listed on company documents as Redpoc's "principal place of business".Photo: Christopher Pearce
The same building was damaged by fire in 2015 after an unknown person forced entry and a blaze started shortly afterwards.
In 1993, a tenant in the building contacted police after noticing petrol dripping through the ceiling.
There is no suggestion that Mr Wehbe nor Mr Obeid had any involvement in the fires.
Mr Wehbe was one of 55 people who provided character references for Eddie Obeid, who was  for misconduct in public office over his family's secret business deals at Circular Quay.
Police are urging anyone with information about the fires to contact .
