  <title>Fortescue offers childcare for Perth staff</title>
  <content>
Fortescue Metals has begun offering staff at its Perth headquarters a free childcare service.
The iron ore miner has opened a family room where children can be professionally supervised when special circumstances arise that may otherwise have kept an employee at home.
Chief executive Nev Power says the the company wants to create a welcoming and encouraging environment for women.
"We want to make real change by providing practical solutions to support women and parents in the workplace," he said in a statement.
The supervision will be offered by a third-party provider during standard business hours and the company said it will explore whether it can offer child supervision for late workers.
More than 700 staff work in Fortescue's Perth office, and 17.3 per cent of the company's total workforce are women.
