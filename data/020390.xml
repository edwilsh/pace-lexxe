  <title>Speculation about his future is news to Gidley</title>
  <content>
KNIGHTS chief executive Matt Gidley has been surprised by speculation surrounding his future.

LONG-SERVING: Matt Gidley has been the Knights' CEO for six years.
Former Newcastle coach Michael Hagan said on radio on Saturday that it was a "likely scenario" Gidley would stand down if a proposed takeover of the Knights by Wests Group is endorsed by members, possibly to accept another role in the club.

Gidley said he was "not sure where that has come from" and insisted he had "not made any decisions at this stage".
The former Test centre, a member of Newcastle's Hall of Fame, has been CEO since he was appointed by Nathan Tinkler in 2011.
The week-look ballot of Wests members will be discussed by the group's board of directors on Monday.

It is understood more than 15,000 members have voted, more than 90 per cent of whom have endorsed the proposal.

In comparison, around 2500 Knights members voted 97 per cent in favour of the ill-fated Tinkler buyout.
