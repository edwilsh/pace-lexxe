Charity Got Your Back Sista organised for 300 participants wearing 'I say no' shirts to walk onto the field at Saturday's Newcastle Knights game and lead the crowd to hold up banners in response to questions including 'Is it okay to remain silent about violence?' and 'Do you pledge never to be violent against another person?"

Charity founder Melissa Histon said countless attendees approached or sent her messages afterwards to share their story and thank the group for speaking up. "Given the interaction from the crowd I think people are ready and it is time for us to talk about this publicly," she said. "I really hope this experience has helped people feel permission to say 'This happened to me' and supported and validated that what they experienced is not acceptable." The event raised about $25,000 for abuse survivors.
