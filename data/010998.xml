  <title>Push for plastic bag & bottle ban in Vanuatu needs care</title>
  <content>
A growing number of Pacific Island countries are moving towards a ban on plastic bags, but Vanuatu is set to go one step further, following Prime Minister Charlot Salwai's Independence Day announcement that he also wants to ban plastic bottles.
The question now though is whether the Prime Minister's strategy will work.
