HUNDREDS have turned out to farewell Hunter tennis legend Peter Doohan, who died last month after a brief battle with motor neurone disease. 
Dubbed the "Becker Wrecker" after famously defeating two-time defending champion Boris Becker at Wimbledon in 1987, Doohan reached a career-high world ranking of 43.  
He was diagnosed with an aggressive form of MND in May and given only months to live.
Doohan, who was living at Nelson Bay, died on July 21, aged 56. 
Newcastle West's Sacred Heart Cathedral was packed with family, friends and fellow tennis players for a moving service on Saturday.
Doohan's sons, John and Hunter, spoke of their father's sense of humour, his love of the Newcastle Knights and his outstanding tennis career. 
Father Brian Mascord, who told those gathered that Doohan had "whooped" him on the tennis court on more than one occasion, said the Australian tennis great would be buried in a pair of "budgie smugglers", a Knights singlet and a Knights blanket.
"That is loyalty," Father Mascord said.
"And after Peter died the Knights won their first game in ages.
"When Peter comes to be canonised, that's his first miracle.
"It has to be a miracle."
With an Australian flag draped over his coffin, Doohan was carried from the cathedral and through a guard of honour, formed by some of his young tennis students with racquets in hand, outside. 
Born in Newcastle, Doohan spent his formative years at Merewether High School, playing tennis at District Park in Broadmeadow on weekends under the guidance of coach Frank Brent. 
After turning professional, he spent 20 years playing and coaching in the United States. 
He was based in Arkansas, where he went to university, was an All-American and twice won the NCAA doubles title.
Doohan returned to Nelson Bay in 2009 and coached up until June last year.
His victory over Becker in the second-round at Wimbledon in 1987 made him a household name in Australia, but he was far from a one-match wonder. 
He was unbeaten in the Davis Cup, won the South Australian Open singles title and reached No. 15 in the world in doubles, winning five titles during his distinguished career. 
He was also the runner-up in the men's doubles at the Australian Open in 1987, he and partner Laurie Warder going down to Swedes Anders Jarryd and Stefan Edberg. 
In lieu of flowers, Doohan's family asked that a donation in Peter's memory be made at the Service to Motor Neurone Disease Association of NSW.
