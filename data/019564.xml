  <title>Boy injured after falling onto rocks at Avon Descent white water race</title>
  <content>
A teenage boy has been injured after falling from a bridge onto rocks at Bells Rapids while watching the Avon Descent, a white water race held annually east of Perth.
The accident happened about 11:15am as competitors continued to race through the rapids.
It took emergency services about 20 minutes to stretcher the boy off the rocks, with fast moving water making the rescue difficult.
He was being assessed at the scene.
More to come.
