  <title>Home units evacuated after crane collapses onto penthouse</title>
  <content>
Emergency services have evacuated a number of apartment buildings in Wolli Creek after a crane collapsed into one building on Brodie Spark Drive.
It is unknown if any people remain trapped inside the building.
A nearby building has also been evacuated due to concerns that the crane may shift position.
Paramedics are currently treating the three crane operators. They are all in stable conditions.
Witnesses say that a nearby crane was able to rescue the three men from the collapsed crane by lifting a cage to the driver carriage.
Emergency services have closed the roads surrounding the area.
