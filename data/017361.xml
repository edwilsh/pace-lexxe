A SMALL fishing club south of Cairns is ramping up efforts to expand its membership ahead of its open fishing and spearing competition this month.
The Babinda and District Amateur Fishing Club president Clayton Stewart said the region had many fine areas for anglers in waterways beyond Gordonvale.
The club's fishing competition is on August 25-27 and takes in a zone from the Barron River to Mourilyan Harbour and all off shore adjacent.
Entry forms are available from most tackle stores from Clifton Beach to Tully. For more details contact Clayton Stewart on 0431 446 158.
