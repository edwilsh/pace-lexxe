  <title>Killer has appeal dismissed</title>
  <content>
A man who killed a Sydney sex worker by slitting her throat and bashing her with her own stiletto has lost a bid to have his conviction overturned.
Chungaung Piao was found guilty of murdering Tina Fang, whose body was left in a room at Adelaide's Grand Chancellor Hotel on New Year's Day, 2015.
The South Australian Court of Criminal appeal unanimously rejected his bid to overturn the conviction on Thursday ordering Piao continue to serve his minimum 25-year jail sentence.
