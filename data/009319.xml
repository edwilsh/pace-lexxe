CONOR McGregor can smash Floyd Mayweather inside four rounds if he connects with his left hand, insists Rory McIlroy.
But the golfer reckons his mate will have "no chance" if it goes beyond a fifth because Mayweather's superior boxing skills will show through.
McIlroy - who is set to name best mate Harry Diamond on his bag for his next two events after sacking caddie JP Fitzgerald - is a massive boxing and UFC fan.
And he has been following all the build up to the billion dollar fight taking place in Las Vegas on August 26.
McGregor won the verbal sparring - but four-time Major champ McIlroy believes he can also win in the ring.
He told the Daily Mail: "This isn't just because I know Conor, but I think he's got a chance.
"In the first four rounds, if he roughs him up a little bit and connects with a few left hands ...
"If he gets in there and he's sort of different and awkward, weird and unorthodox, you just never know.

"Everyone says Mayweather has had his difficulties with southpaws in the past, but if it goes past the fifth round and he [McGregor] hasn't been able to land a shot then he's got no chance.

"I think it has to be within the first three or four rounds."
And McIlroy, from Belfast in Northern Ireland, was quick to highlight McGregor's humble side despite all the bravado.
He added: "He goes to the Straight Blast gym in Dublin and spends time with the kids.
"There's a lot of stuff people don't see with McGregor. I hope he does well. I'm glad he got the fight. You never know what will happen."

FLOYD SHOWS OFF HIS MANY TALENTS
Floyd Mayweather will be hoping to hit Conor McGregor with some accurate shots of his own ... but for now he is finding his range with a basketball.
The undefeated boxing champ took a break from training to shoot some hoops with some friends.
Mayweather, whose record stands at 49 wins and zero defeats, has been hitting the gym hard ahead of the richest fight in boxing history on August 26.
But the 40-year-old found time to relax as he enjoyed another hobby of his playing basketball.
Mayweather took to Instagram to post a video of himself sinking shots.
Alongside it he said: "Just shooting round. Working on my mid-range jumper."

And it appears his talents don't just lie in boxing having connected with the bottom of the net an impressive 11 times in a row.
Meanwhile McGregor is keeping his 16 million followers updated ahead of the fight, uploading pictures of himself training in the gym.
But it appears his training session almost got out of hand when he had to be separated during a fiery sparring session.
According to top ref Joe Cortez, he had to play peacemaker when McGregor and sparring partner Paulie Malignaggi tried to "rough each other up."
He told RUSH 93: "It was the real thing, I had to stop the action, say, 'You guys are a little out of control here, you've got to stop this'. You know, they got a little rough.
"They were both roughing each other up and I had to stop the action like it was a regular fight."
