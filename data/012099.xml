  <title>South Australian State Library evacuated</title>
  <content>
The South Australian State Library was evacuated for a short time on Thursday after paint fumes from a restoration project caused library patrons to feel ill.
The Metropolitan Fire Service said several people were treated at the scene by ambulance crews.
The MFS tracked the source of a problem to paint primer fumes which had spread through the air conditioning system, and used specialist equipment to ventilate the building.
