  <title>Panthers close in on finals position</title>
  <content>
AUSSIE RULES: Caloundra's finals hopes have been given a boost after moving into the top-five for the first time this year.
The Panthers toppled Coorparoo 13.15 (93) to 13.2 (80) at home on Saturday to move up into equal fifth on the 10-team south-east Queensland division one ladder.
However, a dominant fourth quarter effort from the visitor almost had Caloundra on the brink of an upset loss, according to coach Steve Moody.
After leading 81-38 at the end of the third quarter, the Panthers faced an onslaught from Coorparoo whick kicked seven goals in the final stages of the match.
"We had a bit of a scare in the last quarter," he said.
"They got on a roll and we found it difficult to stop them and they got within two goals of us."
Despite the close call, Moody was happy with the performance.
"For the first time this year we sit in the top five so that's a good thing," he said.
"We said with four games left we needed to win three of the four and at the moment we are at two for two. Hopefully, we can make it three for three after next week and keep on plodding away."
But it will be hard work, with Caloundra facing the second-placed Maroochydore at home this weekend.
"For a number of different reasons that's going to be a big game for us," Moody said.
"It's going to be a tough game and they are a good side.
"(But) if we get a win next week, depending on other results, I'd say it very well could consolidate our spot in the final five."
Moody said he would be looking to the defence to ensure the Panthers are a chance on its run to the finals.
"The back six are the cornerstone of our success to date in my opinion," he said.
In other games Maroochydore defeated the University of Queensland 17.19 (121) to 14.6 (90) and Noosa toppled Burleigh 26.15 (171) to 6.4 (40).
The Maroochydore women lost to University of Queensland in the inaugural 50th Anniversary Women's Cup.
