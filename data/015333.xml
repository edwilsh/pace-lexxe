  <title>Sports star of month set to press claims at world titles</title>
  <content>
CANOE: They reached the final of the women's K2 500 at the Rio Olympics but Alyssa Bull and Alyce Burnett are expected to fare even better at this month's world championships.
The Sunshine Coast products surprised some to make the Australian team before they finished eighth in Brazil.
Now, they're established paddlers on the international scene and Canoeing Australia national performance director Shaun Stephen believes the pair can produce a stronger showing against the globe's best in the Czech Republic.
"We're looking probably for them to improve on their Rio results."
"Without placing too much expectation on them, we really believe they can perform and be gunning for potentially a medal but certainly (at least being) mid-field in the A-final."
Bull is the Sunshine Coast Sports Federation's Senior Sports Star of July after the under-23 world championships in Romania, where she won the K1 1000 and was second in the K1 500.
"She's got that toughness and hardness about her," Stephens said. "I think both of them have big futures."
"We've also got Tokyo (2020 Olympics) as the big picture so we're not wanting to rush things, but they certainly seem to be ahead of where they were this time last year, before Rio."
