  <title>Storm cells about to hit Sunshine Coast</title>
  <content>
AN INTENSE storm cell moving east from Maleny is about to hit Landsborough and Caloundra while the rest of the Sunshine Coast can expect thunder, rain and lightning in the next few hours.

Bureau of Meteorology meteorologist David Grant said the storm system about to hit Caloundra has dumped 10-20mm on Maleny and the hinterland.

He said within the next few hours more storms expected from a system moving south-east across the Wide Bay will also dump rain on the region.

Those storms are near Gayndah at present and making their way towards us, dropping 10-20mm, with isolated patches of 50-60mm being recorded.

Mr Grant said we can expect to see a few "thunderbolts too" over the next few hours.
