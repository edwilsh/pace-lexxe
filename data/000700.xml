  <title>Donations ban plan has merit: Palaszczuk</title>
  <content>
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says Labor Senator Sam Dastyari's call to ban all political donations has merit but would need full public support.
Senator Dastyari wants donations to political parties scrapped, which would likely leave taxpayers footing the bill for election campaigns.
Ms Palaszczuk says campaign costs are an unavoidable political reality so parties need funding from somewhere but the public would need to be "fully engaged" in the debate if taxpayer funds were used.
