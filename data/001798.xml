Delma, the shark-inspired 1970s Holden Statesmen, will be transporting Wollongong builders Sean Vickery and Nathan Fay from Sydney to Darwin.

The duo will be taking part in the Variety Club's BtoB Bash fundraiser, starting on Thursday.

Mr Vickery and Mr Fay, from G.J. Gardner Homes Wollongong and Shoalhaven will tackle the nearly 5000km trek, due to conclude on August 13. They will be joined by Horst Lueckl from GJG Sydney North.
It's the third year the G.J. Gardner Homes Wollongong directors have participated in the rally which raises money for sick and disadvantaged children.

Mr Vickery and Mr Fay decided to participate in the Bash following their initial support of the charity in 2014 with the G.J. Variety Freedom House, an initiative created by Mr Vickery and Mr Fay and built in the Shoalhaven, which raised $225,000.

"Delma the shark car has been to the mechanic for some tender loving care and is now purring like a kitten and ready to tackle the outback roads of Australia," Mr Fay said. 
The Bash, created by Dick Smith in 1985, features adventurers racing thousands of kilometres through regional and rural parts of Australia in vehicles built prior to 1977.

The Wollongong duo has a goal of $60,000 this year; up from 2016's $50,000 target.
