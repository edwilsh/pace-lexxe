  <title>Australia, US, Japan call for South China Sea code to be legally binding</title>
  <content>
Australia, the United States and Japan have urged South-East Asia and China to ensure that a code of conduct on the South China Sea they have committed to draw up will be legally binding, and said they strongly opposed "coercive unilateral actions".

Key points:

ASEAN and China are making steps towards a South China Sea code of conduct
There are concerns China will not allow the code to be legally binding
Australia, the US and Japan urged against moves that 'increase tensions'

The statement came after a meeting between Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, on the sidelines of a South-East Asian political forum in the Philippines.
The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China should establish a set of rules that is "legally binding, meaningful, effective, and consistent with international law", the foreign ministers said.
Foreign ministers of ASEAN and China adopted a negotiating framework for a code of conduct over the weekend, a move they hailed as progress but seen by critics as a tactic to buy China time to consolidate its maritime power.
Australia, the United States and Japan also "voiced their strong opposition to coercive unilateral actions that could alter the status quo and increase tensions".
They urged claimants to refrain from land reclamation, construction of outposts and militarisation of disputed features, in a veiled reference to .
The three countries are not claimants but have long been vocal on the issue, arguing their interest is in ensuring freedom of navigation and overflight.
They urged China and the Philippines to abide by , where more than $3 trillion ($AU3.8 trillion) worth of sea-borne goods pass every year.
Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have competing claims there.
Code may become 'gentlemen's agreement'

The code framework is an outline for what China and ASEAN call "consultations" on a formal agreement, which could start later this year.
China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that hinged on whether the situation was stable, and if there was no "major interference" from outsiders.
Several ASEAN countries want the code to be legally binding, enforceable and have a dispute resolution mechanism.
However experts say China will not allow that, and ASEAN may end up acquiescing to what amounts to a gentlemen's agreement.
Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said it was still premature to conclude the outcome of the negotiations for the code of conduct, which will be done by lawyers.
"One key issue is the question of legally binding," he told reporters late on Sunday.
"Surely when we move into the [Code of Conduct], it has got to have some additional or significant legal effect."
Philippine Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano said he preferred a legally binding agreement, which other countries, like Vietnam, supported.
Jay Batongbacal, an expert on the South China Sea at the University of the Philippines, told news channel ANC the adoption of the framework gave China "the absolute upper hand" in terms of strategy, because it would be able to decide when the negotiating process could start.

Vietnam, China, Malaysia have eyes on the prize

*

Rich in resources and traversed by a quarter of global shipping, the South China Sea is the stage for several territorial disputes that threaten to escalate tensions in the region.
At the heart of these disputes are a series of barren islands in two groups - the Spratly Islands, off the coast of the Philippines, and the Paracel Islands, off the coasts of Vietnam and China.

*

Both chains are essentially uninhabitable, but are claimed by no fewer than seven countries, eager to gain control of the vast oil and gas fields below them, as well as some of the region's best fishing grounds.
Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei have made claims to part of the Spratlys based on the internationally recognised Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), which extends 200 hundred nautical miles from a country's coastline.

*

Based on the EEZ, the Philippines has the strongest claim on the Spratlys and their resources, with its EEZ covering much of the area.
However the lure of resources, and prospect of exerting greater control over shipping in the region, means that greater powers are contesting the Philippines' claims.

*

China has made extensive sovereignty claims on both the Spratlys and the Paracels to the north, based largely on historic claims outlined in a map from the middle part of the 20th Century known as the 'Nine Dash Map'.
Taiwan also makes claims based on the same map, as it was created by the nationalist Kuomintang government, which fled to Taiwan after the communists seized power in China.

*

Vietnam also claims the Spratlys and the Paracels as sovereign territory, extending Vietnam's EEZ across much of the region and bringing it into direct conflict with China.
There have been deadly protests in Vietnam over China's decision to build an oil rig off the Paracels.
One Chinese worker in Vietnam was killed and a dozen injured in riots targeting Chinese and Taiwanese owned factories, prompting 3,000 Chinese nationals to flee the country.

*

EEZ can only be imposed based on boundaries of inhabitable land, and this has prompted all the countries making claims on the region to station personnel, and in some cases build military bases out of the water, to bolster their claim.
Building and protecting these structures has resulted in a series of stand-offs between countries in the region, each with the potential to escalate.
China has been leading the charge with these installations, and has deployed vessels to the region to protect their interests.
Chinese coast guard vessels have used a water cannon on Vietnamese vessels, as well as blockading an island where the Philippines has deployed military personnel.
