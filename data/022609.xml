  <title>Doctor warns charging for snakebite anti-venom will cause deaths in Port Moresby</title>
  <content>
A policy of charging money to treat snakebite at Port Moresby's main hospital could mean people dying who could have been saved.
That's according to Dr Sam Yockopua, Director of Emergency Medicine at Port Moresby General Hospital.
He says the new policy of charging snakebite victims 15,000 kina, or six thousand Australian dollars for anti-venom will dissuade victims from getting treated, and many doctors at the hospital are unhappy about it.
