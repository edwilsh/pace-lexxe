  <title>Thousands of Territory kids sleeping rough</title>
  <content>
IN excess of 4000 Territory children 12 years old or younger are homeless - more than any other jurisdiction throughout the nation.
The Charity Mission Australia report, to be released today, shows the youth homelessness crisis gripping the Territory has been triggered by our skyrocketing rates of domestic violence.
Almost half (44 per cent) of the 15,470 homeless Territorians aged under 25 reported domestic violence as the cause of their troubles.
New South Wales, a state with a population that dwarfs the Northern Territory's, has the next most number of homeless kids (3638) under age 12 compared to the NT's 4183. The NT social housing waitlist stands at 3000.
A spokeswoman for NT housing minister Gerry McCarthy said about $6 million had been allocated last year specifically for children, young people and families who require support due to homelessness or risk of homelessness.
"The Territory Labor Government believe good housing is a right for every Territorian - a good home leads to a good education, good health and good community outcomes," she said.
"Yet sadly the Territory has the highest rate of homelessness in the nation. Homelessness in the NT is driven primarily by overcrowding in remote Aboriginal communities." She said $100 million would be spent in the 2017-18 financial year to improve remote housing.
"People living in overcrowded houses are classified as homeless and this contributes significantly to the Territory's high rates."
Mission Australia chief Catherine Yeoman said young Australians "deserve a safe home and we have the means to provide it".
"All that is needed is the political will and the commitment from us all as a community," she said.
