  <title>Boyolali residents granted permission to hunt down macaque monkeys after repeated attacks</title>
  <content>
The little-known regency of Boyolali in Indonesia's Central Java has long been under attack from an unlikely but often extremely vicious culprit.
Throughout the villages of Boyolali, residents both young and old say they have been attacked and injured to the point that the community no longer feels safe.
The attackers live on the outskirts of various towns in lush but depleting jungle, but it seems they are unable to resist engaging with humans or seeking their food.

"Since the beginning of June this year until today [early August], there have been 13 people attacked by monkeys," the head of the Sendang village, Sukimin, who goes by one name, told the ABC.
"We have tried thousands of ways to handle these monkeys, but they keep failing. So now we have to control the area in shifts."
According to Sukimin, the wild macaques have a problem with authority and mostly only attack after being verbally abused, but sometimes they will even if unprovoked.
Now the community is taking action against the furry predators.
They have been granted permission from Central Java's Natural Resources Conservation Centre (BKSDA) to shoot the animals with tranquiliser bullets.
'We don't use sharp bullets'

So dressed in army khaki, residents - some of whom are members of a local shooting club - have taken it upon themselves to hunt the animals down.
"The BKSDA said to the community that they understood what the people in the village were dealing with and that action needed to be taken," Sukimin said.
"We don't use sharp bullets."
The latest victim of the vicious macaques was an 82-year-old local last Friday.

"The monkeys would show up suddenly and attack people [indiscriminately], old people ... one of them was [even] an elementary student," Sukimin told the ABC.
"These old people were just sitting around relaxing, minding their own business when the monkey's attack."
Sukimin said the patrols to hunt down the monkeys would continue until the community felt safe again.
In coming times, the macaques that have been thus far pushed out from their natural habitat as it continually reduces in size are going to have a tough lesson to learn - that is, if the humans can outsmart them, find them, and shoot them first.
