  <title>Lees on a high for fresh start</title>

Le Romain and Kris Lees

Kris Lees believes prizemoney - the return to owners - is the greatest indicator of success for a trainer.
But no matter how you look at it, the Newcastle trainer completed his greatest season on Monday.
Lees missed out with three runners at Port Macquarie on Monday as fellow Broadmeadow trainer Paul Perry won with Sausalito to cap his season.
Lees still managed 161 wins nationwide, 158 in NSW, four group 1 victories and just over $9 million in prizemoney earned. All were easily best totals for Lees, who starts his new season at Cessnock on Tuesday.
Lees expected a strong debut over 900m from three-year-old filly Sunday Special, which is part-owned by Hunter sporting identities Jack and Clint Newton.
"She's trialled at Wyong and Newcastle, a nice up and running filly," Lees told Racing NSW. "She has drawn well in a suitable maiden."
Lees also has the likes of Eastern Paradise in a benchmark 60 handicap (1350m) and Atlantic Edge, which has won at Mudgee and Cessnock, in the the class two (1570m) at Cessnock.
"Brian Guy had Eastern Paradise, for those mid-weekers at Doomben, but he's in his right race for us off a spell, fitter for two trials and the one race start this time in," Lees said. 

"Atlantic Edge will be competitive in her right grade as well, an on pacer, race fit coming off a maiden and a class two win."

Le Romain, which won two group 1s for Lees in 2016-17, resumes alongside stablemate Invincible Gem in the group 2 Missile Stakes on Saturday at Randwick.
