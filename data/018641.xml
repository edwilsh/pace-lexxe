A MASSIVE search is underway after a Marine Corps aircraft crashed off the coast of Australia.
Military officials said in a statement an MV-22 crashed off the east coast of Australia. It's unclear how many service members were on board.
Officials said small boats and aircrafts from the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unite and Bonhomme Richard Expeditionary Strike Group are conducting the search and rescue operations.
The crash comes just weeks after a Marine Corps cargo plane spiralled out of the sky and into the Mississippi Delta, killing 15 Marines and a Navy Corpsman.
About 70 per cent of the Marine Corps fighter jets can't fly due to a shortage of spare parts, and reduced flights hours after years of budget cuts, officials say.
Additional information about Saturday's crash was not readily available.
