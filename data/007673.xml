  <title>Euro Done Deals: City ship out four to Spain</title>
  <content>
SPANISH international winger Jesus Navas returned to Sevilla after being released on Tuesday, the La Liga club announced on their website.
Navas had been a free agent since being released by Manchester City at the end of last season.
"Sevilla FC have reached an agreement with Jesus Navas, with the player signing a deal on Tuesday keeping him at the club for the next four seasons," Sevilla said in a statement.
The 31-year-old moves back to Spain after four seasons with City, during which he won the 2013/14 Premier League title and two English League Cups.
Navas, who played 395 times for Sevilla after his first-team debut in 2003, has 35 international caps but hasn't played for Spain since being left out of the 2014 World Cup squad.
"Navas comes home with the firm intention of becoming Sevilla FC's all-time (record) appearance holder," the club added.
Navas is only 19 short of the current record of 414 appearances held by club legend Juan Arza.
Manchester City have also sent three young stars on loan to La Liga newcomers Girona.
Brazilian midfielder Douglas Luiz, Colombian winger Marlos Moreno and Spanish midfielder Aleix Garcia will all spend the forthcoming season with Girona as City strengthen their links with the club.
City had already sent Pablo Maffeo on loan to Girona earlier this week for the right-back's third spell with the Spaniards.
Luiz's move comes just weeks after the highly-rated 19-year-old was signed by City from Vasco da Gama for Â£10 million.
"Girona will give Douglas the perfect opportunity to develop at the top level of the European game," City director of football Txiki Begiristain said.

Moreno, 20, was signed by City last year but spent the 2016-17 campaign on loan at Deportivo La Coruna.
Garcia and Maffeo, both 20, have been on the fringes of the City first team without earning regular opportunities.
City have been working closely with Girona in recent seasons and this week announced a friendly against them in Catalonia on August 15, just three days after Pep Guardiola's side play their Premier League opener against Brighton.
Finally, Nice centre-back Dante said he is delighted that star forward Mario Balotelli and coach Lucien Favre decided to stay at the Ligue 1 club.
Nice face a trip to Amsterdam to take on Ajax in the Champions League qualifying second leg on Wednesday in their first ever participation in Europe's premier competition.
Although Balotelli will be missing after suffering a hamstring injury in the 1-1 first leg draw in southern France, in which he scored Nice's goal, Dante is relieved the temperamental Italian has remained on the Cote d'Azur.
"Mario was free (to leave). The two parties made an effort, though. We're very happy with that," said Brazilian Dante.
Favre had been courted by Borussia Dortmund in the close season but Nice, who finished third in the top flight last season, ruled out any exit for the Swiss coach in June, with the Bundesliga outfit appointing Peter Bosz instead.
"I never though the coach would leave before the end of his contract," said Dante.
"He behaves in the right way and is respectful of his commitments, and he never told me about a desire to leave.
"It is normal that he thought about it a bit, as Dortmund are a very big club."
