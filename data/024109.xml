  <title>Coast has a proud tradition of trawling</title>
  <content>
MY LATE father Colin "Lex" Mackay was born in 1937 and grew up on the Maroochy river system, back when boats were daily transport.
His Kuskopf uncles were highly-equipped fisherman and boat builders on the Coast, so it was no surprise Lex also turned to fishing.
Fifty years ago, about the time the Sunshine Coast adopted its new name, Mooloolaba not only attracted commercial fisherman but also a percentage who fished either for a second income, as a hobby, as a food source or the crafty boat builders that chose to just give it a go after a build.
In his early 20s, one of Lex's first trawling jobs was with his uncle Harry Kuskopf on the Kingfisher. He then skippered Joe Davis's Centenary Star, catching mackerel off Townsville for years.
His sea days took him as far as the Gulf of Carpentaria catching prawns.
Lex was precise at keeping logbooks to record dates, weather, locations and catch size.
In the 1960s he purchased and fitted out the Mary Ann Jane until January 1970, when it capsized in huge seas, nine miles off Point Cartwright.
Miraculously, Lex and his deckhand Laurie Willersdorf were saved by pure chance when Captain Smales of the Bossanova looked back in a lightning flash and saw them clinging to the brine tank.
Not long after this ordeal, my father based the Mooloolaba workshop of his business, Suncoast Trawler Service, on the corner of Burnett St and Hancock Lane, where he was well known for accurate engineering skills and the ability to make or fix anything.
He was the Yamaha dealer, the North Coast agent for Hydrive hydraulic boat steering for over 35 years, plus the Brisbane Pilot Station and Mooloolaba Coast Guards "go-to man" for repairs.
He exhibited at the annual prawn festivals at Mooloolaba Spit, Charles Clarke Park and later Lawries Marina.
He was still able to complete his last install job at the age of 75.
Other local trawler man of his era included Allan Jones (Taipan Star) Len Wallison (Dorado) Eddie Ratcliffe (Catherine May) and Bub Evans (Moby Dick).
