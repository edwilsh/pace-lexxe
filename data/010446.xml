News this week that  has offered little inspiration to those trying to save for a house deposit.
.

Surging house prices are locking young people out of the market, with less than 20 per cent of Sydneysiders owning a home, while average incomes have also declined.
A number of solutions being explored by housing researchers and community housing providers are alternative models of affordable home ownership.

More on the HILDA survey:

"What we need is a variety of different housing types," Wendy Hayhurst, chief executive of the NSW Federation of Housing Association (NSWFHA), said.
"We've got a range of people who are priced out of any secure housing, from people who are homeless to people who are working but on very low income.
"There are different options like shared home ownership."
The NSWFHA is the peak industry body for housing associations in NSW.
Community land trusts

One model of home ownership is the sale of properties on land owned by the private non-profit sector.
Louise Crabtree from the Institute for Culture and Society at Western Sydney University said the principle involved new owners paying for the house but not the land.
"The cost of land is dependent on different areas ... but in expensive areas it could make quite a difference to the property," Dr Crabtree said.
"It's bought at the construction cost of the home, land price isn't generally included in that."
Dr Crabtree said that when the owner wanted to sell the property, a valuation formula to calculate what people would receive back on their home would be applied.
"They can own it, get all the stability and leave with a little bit of a gain so they sell and move out, but not sell at such a high rate they've priced out the next buyer," she said.
Dr Crabtree has been working with community housing providers and conducted research into modelling alternative home ownership schemes used in the UK and US.
Shared ownership

One of the schemes Dr Crabtree said was "not far off" from being realised in NSW was the concept of shared home ownership.
A buyer purchases a 25 to 75 per cent stake in a property, while the remainder is co-owned by a community housing provider.
South Australia and Western Australia are the only states that have state-based shared schemes, she said.

The model is similar to affordable rental housing provided by community housing providers or developers, who are already "used to building quality housing that aren't overpriced."
Like current schemes, providers would only sell to buyers that meet certain financial criteria and ensure that monthly mortgage repayments and maintenance did not exceed 30 per cent of the household income.
One challenge though that the UK had experienced was allowing owners to buy out the provider by paying 100 per cent of the equity before reselling the property.
"We're advising against having that," Dr Crabtree said.
"Instead we need to be looking at how you set that resale formula so that you're giving the seller an equity gain but not pricing out the next owner."

Helping first home buyers

The NSWFHA is lobbying the State Government to give shared equity buyers access to the first home buyers grant.
Currently, the grant which waives stamp duty for properties priced up to $600,000 and concessions for homes up to $800,000, stipulates that both parties buying into a property must be "natural persons".
It excludes registered community housing entities.
"It's a simple change," Ms Hayhurst said.
"Even part home ownership gives people a secure home that they have a stake in.
"They could stay with how much they own, they could buy another slice of the property when their income goes up, or they could choose to move and gain any of the capital gains from the portion of the house."
Given affordable house ownership would require properties to be sold under market value, Ms Hayhurst said the Government needed to help subsidise the schemes as it does with affordable rental housing.
Ms Hayhurst cited the affordable housing apartments in Eveleigh as an example.
"That could have mixed tenure - social rental, market sales and affordable home ownership," she said.
"You need a commitment from government that this is a legitimate and non-risk product."
