RYAN Callinan safely negotiated the Huntington Beach pier and his way into round three at the US Open of Surfing with a powerful display on Tuesday (AEST).
The Merewether surfer was second behind countryman and championship tour rookie Ethan Ewing to book a showdown with Frenchman Joan Duru, Brazilian Alejo Muniz and Japan's Hiroto Ohhara at the 10,000-point qualifying series contest.
Callinan was third and needing a 5.8 to progress with less than eight minutes remaining and produced two powerful turns before slicing through the pier pylons for a 6.77. That combined with a 6.17 from another two-turn wave midway through the heat to put him into second with 12.94.
Peru's Miguel Tudela remained a threat late but Callinan improved his buffer with a carbon copy of his two-turn, pylon-threading ride for a 6.4 and 13.17 total. Ewing won with 13.8, Tuleda finished on 11.96 and Sam Pupo on 9.5.
Callinan had earlier gone to the air twice in the battle for a top-two spot but was unable to ride out of the landings.
The goofy-footer lost to Ewing in the quarter-finals of the same event last year when he was on the CT and his rival was powering his way to the main tour on the QS.
