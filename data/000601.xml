TWO people have been charged for assaulting a police officer at the Townsville Cup.
A 23-year-old woman and a 22-year-old man were arrested on two counts of serious assault police and one count of serious assault police causing bodily harm.
Stuart Police officer in charge Senior Sergeant Gavin Oates said the male police officer was breaking up a disturbance at the races about 3pm on Saturday when the incident occurred.
"One person has attacked him and then a third party has come in and kicked the officer," he said.
"There were only minor injuries received by the officer.
"The male has struck the officer in the face."
Senior Sergeant Oates said for the most part patrons at the Townsville Cup were well behaved.
"There were a couple of other minor disturbances," he said.
