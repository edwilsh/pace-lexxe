  <title>AFL players get behind marriage equality</title>
  <content>
While politicians continue to squabble, footballers are kicking goals for marriage equality.
Gathering in Melbourne to call for a parliamentary vote on same-sex marriage, the group of AFL players expressed their frustration that some of their gay friends and family do not have the same rights as them.
"We need to stick up for everyone's rights... this is a basic human right," Bulldog Liam Picken said, as Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull faces growing pressure to permit a conscience vote instead of a holding a plebiscite.
