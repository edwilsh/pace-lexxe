  <title>Now this crew is getting up even earlier</title>
  <content>
THE breakfast crew at Brisbane's Hit 105 have taken getting up early to a whole new level.
All keen runners, announcers Abby Coleman, Stav Davidson and Matty Acton have been pounding the pavement well before the crack of dawn to train for The Sunday Mail Bridge to Brisbane Day.
With just three weeks to go until Queensland's biggest fun run on Sunday, August 27, things are now getting competitive.
Acton, the newest member of the team, wouldn't confirm he'd run the 10km course in his hot pink onesie but is considering adding a hood to channel the speed of Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman in the Sydney Olympics.
And he's also been in the bad books with Coleman and Davidson for faking an injury to get out of endurance event Tough Mudder.
Entries are filling fast in both the 10km and 5km events. Last year was a sellout.
