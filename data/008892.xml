  <title>Raceday focus: Pakenham</title>
  <content>
THE reappearance of two of Victoria's top jockeys, Luke Nolen and Dwayne Dunn highlights Thursday's Pakenham Synthetic meeting.
Both jockeys haven't ridden since July 15. Nolen had a winter break and Dunn was suspended. Nolen will ride ROYAL VOLLEY (R1, No. 5, $3.10), while Dunn will partner AGGRAVATE (R2, No. 1, $8.50).
Trainer John Price is confident Royal Volley will run well. The four-year-old had a tough run but hung in for second to Ratoute Yutty at Geelong on July 16.
In the second race, there are several well-bred three-year-olds making their debut. The James Cummings-trained three-year-old HUMBOLDT (R2, No. 4, $3.40) has opened favourite with TAB.
Humboldt is a close relation to star Kiwi filly Bounding and also a half-brother to smart sprinters Kuroshio and Believe 'N' Succeed and he looked like a promising horse in a recent Flemington jump-out.
BEST BET: MAI SHINY CHOICE (R6, No. 2, $2.25)
Two runs back from over a year off have been sound. Worked home strongly last start at Geelong Synthetic for third to Luchador. The step up to 1400m should also suit.
NEXT BEST: ROYAL VOLLEY (R1, No. 5, $3.10)
Lightly-raced gelding showing talent. Raced wide and took the lead a long way out when run down in the closing stages at Geelong last start by the promising Ratoute Yutty but held on well for second.
VALUE BET: SPANKS (R7, No. 6, $7)
Speedy mare who led and battled on fairly at Ballarat last start. Only start here she ran on for second behind the smart Miss Wonderland last year.TRAINER TALK
JOHN PRICE
ROYAL VOLLEY (R1, No. 5, $3.10)
"I thought he was tremendous last start. He didn't have an easy run and the form from that race has stacked up. I gave him a freshen-up after that. From barrier six, he should get a great run and I'm looking forward to him getting his chance to win."
TOFFIATO (R3, No. 6, $3)
"He's had a lot of work and he trialled well about three weeks ago. Provided he doesn't do anything stupid like miss the start, he should be in the finish. I don't know whether he can win but he shouldn't be far away."THE JOCKEY
NIKITA BERIMAN rode a double at the last meeting at this track, on July 30, and she has a strong book of rides again on Thursday, including two first-starters for Greg Eurell, ARLINGTON WAY (R1, No. 10, $21) and SOUTHERN BOLT (R2, No. 5, $15).
