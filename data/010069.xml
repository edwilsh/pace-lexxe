  <title>Donald Trump backs US bill to introduce Australian-style immigration system</title>
  <content>
Washington: President Donald Trump on Wednesday backed legislation that would see the United States introduce an Australian-style skills-based immigration system, replacing a decades-old policy that favours family ties.
At a White House announcement with two Republican senators, Mr Trump put his weight behind a bill that encapsulates his long-standing support for judging applicants for legal residency on the basis of what they offer the US.

Q&A: Could Trump destabilise US-Australia relationship?

Despite the historically strongA relationship, is it possible theA current US administration could change relationsA between Australia and the US?

He argued that the US has accepted too many low-skilled immigrants for too long.
"This competitive application process will favour applicants who can speak English, financially support themselves and their families and demonstrate skills that will contribute to our economy," he said.

"This legislation will not only restore our competitive edge in the 21st century, but it will restore the sacred bonds of trust between America and its citizens.
"This legislation demonstrates our compassion for struggling American families who deserve an immigration system that puts their needs first and that puts America first."

The Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act, sponsored by senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia, revives an idea that was included in broader immigration legislation supported by President George W. Bush in 2007 but that failed in Congress.

Republican supporters argue that it would modernise an immigration policy that has not been updated significantly in half a century. However critics in both parties contended it would harm the economy by keeping out workers who filled low-wage jobs that Americans did not want.Photo: AP
Under the current system, most legal immigrants are admitted to the US based on family ties. US citizens can sponsor spouses, parents and minor children for visas that are not subject to any salary caps, while siblings and adult children get preferences for a limited number of visas available to them.

In 2014, 64 per cent of more than one million immigrants admitted with legal residency were immediate relatives of US citizens or sponsored by family members. Just 15 per cent entered on the basis of employment-based preferences, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent research organisation. That does not mean, however, that those who came in on family ties were necessarily low-skilled or uneducated.
The senators' bill is meant to emulate 'merit-based' systems in Australia and Canada and would award points for education, language and job skills.
"Our current system does not work," Senator Perdue said. "It keeps America from being competitive."
Senator Cotton rejected the notion that the current system was a symbol of US compassion.
"It's a symbol that we're not committed to working-class Americans, and we need to change that," he said.
