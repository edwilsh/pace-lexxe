  <title>Cricket Australia looks to bed down India television deal</title>
  <content>
Cricket Australia faces a race against time and its finances could take a hit if it fails to lock down a lucrative broadcast rights deal in India in time for November's Ashes series.
The sporting body was in the market in India before the escalation of its dispute over pay with its players. But Cricket Australia has not yet signed a television deal to broadcast this summer's Ashes series in India - a deal which is expected to bring in a sum in the tens of millions.
about the pay dispute between Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers' Association and the possibility October's limited overs tour of India would be cancelled.
Incumbent rights holder Star India, owned by Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox, are the favourites to ink a new deal.

But with a pay agreement all sorted out with its players, Cricket Australia is expected to fast-track talks with Indian broadcasters for the  Ashes series between Australia and England.

Sources said Cricket Australia is also keen to pick up talks with local broadcasters for the next TV deal, however a formal process has not begun.
Cricket Australia has been holding informal discussions with local broadcasters and other interest parties for some time.
With the next rights deal not beginning until October 2018, it's understood Cricket Australia will put the tender documents out later this year with a view to clinching a deal by the end of summer.
Cricket Australia is said to be targeting $200 million a year for its next broadcast deal, although  down to a sum closer to $150 million a year.

Nine Entertainment, under a deal signed in 2013, pays $80 million annually to broadcast Test matches and limited-overs internationals. 
Network Ten pays $20 million a year for the Big Bash League and after being the castaway in the last rights negotiations, the Twenty20 tournament is expected to be one of the big prizes in the upcoming deal. Some are forecasting the value of the Big Bash to jump to between $50 million and $70 million annually.
as part of its overall cricket offering, creating more competition for the struggling Ten, which went into voluntary administration in June.

.

However, the ability for television broadcasters to pay more for sports rights is quickly diminishing as revenue in the sector continues to decline and more advertising dollars flow to Silicon Valley giants Facebook and Google.
Meanwhile, Fox Sports signed a new broadcast deal for exclusive rights to International Basketball Federation tournaments, which will feature both the Australian men's and women's teams, the Boomers and Opals, for an undisclosed sum.
"Basketball in Australia is booming thanks to the success of Australia's NBA stars, and our home-grown competitions, the NBL and WNBL," Fox Sports chief executive Patrick Delany said.
"This deal reaffirms Fox Sports' commitment to providing a platform for Australian athletes and exposure for one of Australia's most popular sports."
