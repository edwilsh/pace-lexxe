  <title>Bruce Hwy delays: Multi-vehicle crash causes highway havoc</title>
  <content>
MOTORISTS are reporting traffic is at a standstill on the Bruce Hwy after a multi-vehicle crash this afternoon.

Northbound traffic has reportedly banked up significantly following a multi-vehicle crash at Tanawha, just before Exit 194.

The Department of Transport and Main Roads has advised delays are expected and has asked motorists to proceed with caution in the area.

The crash occurred just before 3pm and police traffic units are on scene.

Motorists have alerted others via social media that traffic was at a standstill, with exits from Caloundra and Landsborough also starting to become extremely congested.

A Police Media spokesman said the two vehicles involved in the crash were "not driveable" and would require towing or removal from the road.

No injuries were reported.
