A KARRINYUP family has described the moment a freak water spout lifted their car in the middle of a Perth highway.
The Jonasson family was driving on West Coast Highway when the spout hit.
"We just saw this stuff flying through the air, and then the tree, and just a tube flying through the air," Louise Jonasson said.
"We thought 'what are we going to go, where are we going to go?'
Mrs Jonasson said the ordeal was like something straight out of the movie Twister.
"My husband braced and I grabbed him and I screamed," she said.
"It seemed like it went on for minutes but it was over in 30 seconds."
The force of the water spout pushed the family's two-tonne car into the median strip.
"It was pretty scary not knowing whether something was going to come in the window or whether it would be so strong it could lift the car."
Luckily for the couple and their 11-year-old son, they came through the winter ordeal unscathed.
