MV-22 INCIDENT

 

 An incident involving a United States Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey helicopter off the coast of Shoalwater Bay.

 

I can confirm no Australian Defence Force personnel were on board the aircraft. 

 

The United States are leading the search and recovery effort. 

 

I have briefed Prime Minister Turnbull and spoken with Secretary Mattis this evening to offer Australia's support in anyway that can be of assistance.

 

Our thoughts are with the crew and families affected.
