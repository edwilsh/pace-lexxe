  <title>Get set to swoon over croon</title>
  <content>
THERE'S no special secret to the timeless classics made famous by the crooners, says performer Derek Metzger.
"A lot of the songs that have been successful for the crooners are about relationships ... (and) those philosophical things that people ask," Metzger said.
"They tug at the heartstrings. They make people think about their own lives."
Put simply, Metzger said, the crooners sang about things people could relate to.
Metzger performs along with Ian Stenlake and Scott Irwin, in the Kings of Croon show - a celebration of the most loved crooners.
Audiences can savour classics including Save the Last Dance for Me, Summer Wind, Mack the Knife, Speak Softly Love and Beyond the Sea - as the performers tip the hat to Andy Williams, Frank Sinatra and others.
Metzger particularly enjoys performing a medley of songs by Anthony Newley during the show.
"He sings about soul searching. He was such a dramatic, dynamic performer. His music speaks to me," Metzger said.
See the Kings of Croon show at Frankston Arts Centre on Friday, August 11, at 10.30am and 1.30pm. Tickets $18/$20.
Bookings:  or phone 9784 1060.
