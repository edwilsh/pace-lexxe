  <title>Trump goes off on '24/7 #Fake News' and says 'Trump base is getting stronger' in morning tweetstorm</title>
  <content>
President Donald Trump went off on the "24/7 #Fake News" in several tweets on Monday morning, asserting that the media's coverage of the investigation of Russia's role in the 2016 campaign and his campaign's potential ties to the Kremlin has brought "the Trump base even closer together."

"Hard to believe that with 24/7 # News on CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, NYTIMES & WAPO, the Trump base is getting stronger!" Trump .

The tweet followed a number of tweets excoriating The New York Times as "totally inept," highlighting a number of his administrations' "successes,"and suggesting that recent Trump rallies indicate that the "Trump base is bigger and stronger than ever."

Trump is spending Monday  in Bedminster, New Jersey for a planned 17-day vacation while the White House's heating and cooling system is replaced. 

The failing , which has made every wrong prediction about me including my big election win (apologised), is totally inept!

The Trump base is far bigger & stronger than ever before (despite some phony Fake News polling). Look at rallies in Penn, Iowa, Ohio.......

...and West Virginia. The fact is the Fake News Russian collusion story, record Stock Market, border security, military strength, jobs.....

... Supreme Court pick, economic enthusiasm, deregulation & so much more have driven the Trump base even closer together. Will never change!
