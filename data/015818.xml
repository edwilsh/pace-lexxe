  <title>Police corruption taskforce branded 'sloppy' for charge mix-up with former Queensland union boss</title>
  <content>
A lawyer for former CFMEU leader Dave Hanna says his client was charged with a non-existent corruption offence and has blasted the "sloppy" police taskforce responsible.
Hanna, 52, has been charged over the destruction of documents that may have been required as part of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption.
Speaking outside the Brisbane Magistrates Court this morning, Terry Fisher said the charge had to be amended before the matter could proceed.
"So far the trade union taskforce has been off to a great start," Mr Fisher said.
"It just shows the sloppy nature of the investigations so far.
"They've charged my client with an offence that didn't exist and they had to sort that out in court this morning.
"With this type of prosecution, my client, Mr Hanna, is looking at all his options.
"It may well be they've simply charged the wrong person with this offence."
Hanna was charged with fraud and other corruption-related offences after allegedly receiving free work on his Brisbane house from construction bosses.
After a brief appearance today, the matter will return to court on October 6.
"They've now finally worked out which is the right section," Mr Fisher said.
"They've had a long time to work on this and they couldn't even get the charge right to start with."
