  <title>4 more senior staffers have exited Guggenheim Partners amid ongoing internal strife</title>
  <content>
Three senior bond traders and a senior portfolio manager have left Guggenheim Partners, according to a report from Bloomberg.

This adds to a wave of recent exits, as 10 other senior staffers had already left the company in the past 15 months  between the firm's two top executives.

The Bloomberg report said the latest round of departures includes: Andrew Arthur, a managing director in sales; Luke Lawrence, a junk-bond trader; Matt Bagley, a distressed-debt trader who decamped for Jefferies, and Eric Gould, a senior portfolio manager for Guggenheim Investments.

The Financial Times  that Mark Walter, the founder and chief executive officer of Guggenheim, has been at odds with Scott Minerd, the chief investment officer and face of the firm, over recent changes to the institutional distribution unit, a division of the firm that serves as a go-between for Guggenheim's money managers and its major investors.

Guggenheim has denied the discord.
