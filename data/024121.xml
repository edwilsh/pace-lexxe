WHEN Shark Tank contestant Luke Lucas appeared on the reality competition he made not just one pitch that night, but two.
After asking the Sharks to invest in the allergy-friendly food business he shares with his girlfriend and business partner Chrissy Glentis, the 31-year-old took another risk by dropping a knee to ask for Glentis's hand in marriage.
"I couldn't pass up the opportunity to tell the whole country that I wanted to marry Chrissy," Lucas told Confidential.
"I couldn't say no to that."

Lucas made Shark Tank history by becoming the first person ever to propose on the show.
The pair have been together for three years and started their food brand, Foddies, six months into the relationship.
The Channel 10 hit will also move to a new competitive timeslot of 7.30pm tonight after enjoying healthy ratings in previous weeks.
Shark Tank airs 7:30pm tonight on Ten.
