A romantic rivalry plays out in the final days of the Ottoman Empire in THE PROMISE, a sweeping historical drama starring Golden Globe winner Oscar Isaac, Charlotte Le Bon and Academy Award winner Christian Bale. In 1914, Armenian medical student Michael (Isaac) travels to the grand city of Constantinople to train as a doctor. There, he falls in love with Ana (Le Bon), a French-educated Armenian artist who is already in a relationship with the fiery Chris (Bale), an American journalist reporting on the growing tensions between Turkey and Armenia. Drawn to each other regardless, Michael and Ana are torn apart when they find themselves on the run for their lives as war breaks out and the Empire turns against its own people.

HE'S famed for drastically changing his body for acting roles - and Christian Bale is just about unrecognisable as he prepares for his latest acting challenge.
The Batman actor, 43, will soon take on the role of former US vice president Dick Cheney in an upcoming biopic by director Adam McKay. The super-fit star is gaining weight for the role, and looked just about unrecognisable with a new close-cropped haircut as he stepped out in LA this month:

It's unclear what part of Cheney's life the as-yet-untitled biopic will portray. The 76-year-old politician and Bale hardly share much of a natural likeness:

Bale's most famous physical transformation to date came back in 2004, when he played a man with crippling insomnia. Bale dieted for four months prior to filming, losing 28kg and bringing his total body weight down to an emaciated 54kg. After filming finished, the 6ft tall actor then had just six months to bulk up for his role in Batman Begins.
