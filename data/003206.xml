  <title>Los Angeles to host 2028 Summer Games: Olympic officials</title>
  <content>
Los Angeles has agreed to host the 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games, the city and the International Olympic Committee confirmed on Monday, in a deal that paves the way for Paris to host the 2024 Summer Games.

31 MINS AGO  UPDATED 3 MINS AGO

"The IOC welcomes this decision of the Los Angeles Olympic and Paralympic Candidature Committee, and we are pleased to release the Host City contract 2028 in a transparent and timely manner," said IOC President Thomas Bach in a statement.

The IOC said it would make contributions to the organising committee worth US $1.8 billion.

In an unprecedented move to award two Games at the same time after several other cities withdrew from contention, the IOC's decision turned the spotlight on security challenges for Paris while giving Los Angeles ample time to upgrade its public transportation system.

The deal was first reported on Monday by the Los Angeles Times, which cited an unnamed source.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said: "This is an historic day for Los Angeles, for the United States and for the Olympic and Paralympic movements around the world. Today, we take a major step toward bringing the Games back to our city for the first time in a generation and begin a new chapter in Los Angeles' timeless Olympic story.

"This agreement with the IOC will allow us to seed a legacy of hope and opportunity that will lift up every community in Los Angeles - not in 11 years' time, but starting now and continuing in the years leading up to the Games. LA 2028 will kick-start our drive to make LA the healthiest city in America, by making youth sports more affordable and accessible than ever before."

The decision was confirmed in nearly simultaneous statements issued by the IOC in Zurich and the Los Angeles Olympic bid committee in LA.

"It is a win-win for the two cities," Canadian senior IOC member Dick Pound told Reuters by phone.

"It's good for the IOC because we've got two great cities lined up for the next two big shows."

The next Olympic Summer Games, in 2020, is already scheduled to be held in Tokyo.

Los Angeles previously hosted the Summer Games in 1932 and 1984.
