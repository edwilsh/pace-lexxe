  <title>Whales stranded off Fraser Island</title>
  <content>
RANGERS are working frantically to comfort two beached whales stuck between Fraser Island and the mainland.
Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service rangers were heading to a nearby island to undertake a planned burn when they spotted the two live whales on Sheridan Flats southwest of Ungowa around 9.30am this morning.
The department said the 10 and 12m humpbacks were stranded in a similar spot to where a pod of killer whales were successfully freed in 2013.
Rangers are currently waiting for high tide hoping the whales will refloat.
