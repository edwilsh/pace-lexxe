Running or walking a half marathon is never easy; doing one that is all uphill as well just makes it that much harder.
Hobart's Point to Pinnacle half marathon is touted as the "toughest half marathon in the world", as participants not only cover 21.1 kilometres in distance but also climb 1,270 metres in height.
Despite, or perhaps because of, how hard it is the race is popular for a lot of first-time marathon runners.

The Point to Pinnacle half marathon is a bucket list item for many
"Last year about half the people doing it were doing it for the first time," fitness trainer Guy Franklin told Ryk Goddard on .
"For a lot of people it's a bucket list thing."
If you have always dreamt of running up that hill, here are some tips to get you moving.
Know how long you have to do the race

Decide if you will walk or run the distance.
Walkers are given four hours and 40 minutes to complete the 21.1km course, runners are given three hours and 40 minutes.
"You've got to be putting some distances like that in whatever training you're doing," Mr Franklin said.
A 10km race, called the Point to Pub, was introduced this year for runners and walkers along the same course as the half marathon.
Mr Franklin said most runners should be able to do that distance in 40 minutes.
Build up your fitness gradually

Mix up your training to keep it interesting and for all-over fitness
If you have never done a half marathon before and are not normally very fit and active, start small and work up to the big event.
"Cross training, mixing it up and getting a lot more active," he said.
Your training should not just be running or walking for hours.
Doing other exercises, such as strength building, helps prevent you getting bored with training and improves overall fitness to help you in the run.
Join a group or find a fitness buddy

Most people are motivated to try harder and keep at their fitness if they do it with someone else.

Training with others will help keep you motivated
If joining a gym or club is not your style, using fitness trackers on your mobile or online might help keep you motivated.
Walking with a friend or pet is also a great way to keep moving.
Get familiar with your race gear before the day

There is no need to buy the most stylish and expensive exercise clothing going, but do start to train in the clothing you intend to wear on race day closer to the event.
That way you will be able to spot if the shorts are the right size and are going to slip or rub before you are half way up the mountain.

Start training in what you plan to wear on the day closer to the event
"In the last day or so you don't want to be grabbing new shoes because you never know what could happen," Mr Franklin said.
Know what to expect

before race day so you know what to expect.
The course map includes information on where things such as water stations and public toilets are along the way so you can be prepared on the day.
