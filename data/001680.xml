Jose Angel launches an own goal from almost halfway

The football preseason has offered up one of the greatest and swiftest examples of "anything you can do, I can do better" in response to .
After the Inter midfielder launched a one-touch bullet into his own net during a friendly against Chelsea, Jose Angel threw his hat into the ring.
During the second half of the preseason clash between La Liga outfit SD Eibar and Schalke 04, Angel gathered the ball just inside his own defensive half.
Then, in similar vein to Kondogbia, he spotted his goalkeeper and fired what was supposed to be a back pass.
Unfortunately, the back pass turned into a perfectly weighted shot at his own goal that Asier Riesgo was powerless to stop.
Making matters worse for Angel and Eibar, it was the only goal either side scored all day.
So, was it worse than Kondogbia's effort?
