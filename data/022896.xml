  <title>Road death jury struggle to reach verdict</title>
  <content>
A jury has indicated it is struggling to reach a verdict in the trial of a New Zealand father of three charged over the death of a man on a busy Queensland motorway in 2015.
Tamate Henry Heke is fighting allegations he unlawfully killed Shane Merrigan by punching the 50-year-old before he was fatally hit by a rubbish truck on the Gateway Motorway in December 2015.
A Brisbane Supreme Court jury retired shortly before 11am on Friday to commence deliberations but indicated via a note at 12.30pm on Monday they had reached an "impasse".
