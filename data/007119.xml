  <title>Alan Jones mocks Sam Armytage's drinking habits</title>
  <content>
RADIO king Alan Jones has let slip on Samantha Armytage's drinking habits during a segment on Sunrise this morning.
The 76-year-old was live on the Channel Seven show to discuss Queen Elizabeth's alcohol consumption when he called out Armytage.
"Quickly, we want to talk to you about the Queen's drinking," Armytage began the discussion.
"Each day Her Majesty enjoys a gin and tonic before lunch, there's wine with lunch, a dry martini and a glass of champagne at night.
"Now that equals six serves of alcohol, which under British government health guidelines makes her apparently a binge drinker ... Alan."
But Armytage wasn't expecting Jones' hilarious comeback.
"Sam, that's light on compared to the last time you and I had dinner," he said.
"Honestly, Sam, you started with the gin and it was very straight with not much tonic water at all, you had the white and the red and you topped it up with some champagne. Come on!"
Armytage responded: "Alan, this is not about me this is about the Queen."
