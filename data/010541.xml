  <title>Move to freeze Clive Palmer's $200 million in assets</title>
  <content>
Liquidators are trying to freeze $200 million of Clive Palmer's assets to recover millions in taxpayer funds used to pay out the former MP's axed Queensland Nickel workers.
The federal government has appointed special purpose liquidators PPB Advisory to try to claw back almost $70 million in taxpayers' money that was used to cover the entitlements of workers who lost their jobs when Mr Palmer's company failed.Photo: AAP
PPB has filed an application in the Supreme Court in Brisbane, seeking to stop the former federal MP from offloading or doing anything to devalue his assets while efforts to recoup those funds continue.
"The Special Purpose Liquidators of Queensland Nickel can confirm that an application has been filed with the Supreme Court of Queensland for orders in respect of the dissipation of assets held by Clive Palmer and associated entities," PPB said in a statement.
"Given the application is before the courts, it is not appropriate to provide any further comment at this stage."
A directions hearing is expected in the Supreme Court on Thursday.
AAP has sought comment from Mr Palmer.
