  <title>Motorway became 'Fast and Furious': court</title>
  <content>
A New Zealander on trial over the death of a man after a roadside confrontation was minding his own business when a busy Queensland motorway "turned into a version of the Fast and the Furious", a court has heard.
Tamate Henry Heke is fighting allegations he unlawfully killed Shane Merrigan by punching the 50-year-old before he was fatally hit by a rubbish truck on the Gateway Motorway on December 1, 2015.
In his closing remarks on Thursday, defence barrister Anthony Kimmins told the Brisbane Supreme Court the motorway "turned into a version of the Fast and the Furious" for his client that afternoon because of Mr Merrigan's aggressive driving style.
