  <title>Student performs indecent act in front of teacher</title>
  <content>
A TEENAGE boy who allegedly performed an indecent act in front of a school staff member and indecently assaulted a woman at an ATM has been charged.

It is alleged the 16-year-old from Manoora went to a Manunda school on January 20, entered an office where a female staff member was working and committed the act in full view of the victim.

She yelled to another staff member in an adjoining office and the youth then fled on foot. He was unable to be located anywhere in the complex.

It will be further alleged that on January 28, the youth was at a Mt Sheridan shopping complex

when he approached a woman from behind and indecently assaulted her whilst she was

withdrawing funds from an ATM.

The woman screamed and the offender fled on foot.

Cairns Child Protection and Investigation Unit detectives spoke with the boy yesterday and he was charged with one count each of committing an indecent act intended to offend and indecent assault.

Neither of the female victims were physically injured as a result of the incidents, and the boy was not known to them.
