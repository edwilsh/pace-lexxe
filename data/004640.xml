1 HOUR AGO 

American broadcaster CNN is reporting that they have been given access to multiple emails exchanged between an impersonator and several high-profile officials in the Trump administration.

While a number of the White House staff seem to have been duped into thinking the emails were from their colleagues, in reality the emails appear to have originated in the UK.

RELATED STORIES:

One incident involved the prankster masquerading as President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor, Jared Kushner, with an Outlook account, and sending a message to the Homeland Security Advisor, Tom Bossert.

"Tom, we are arranging a bit of a soiree towards the end of August. It would be great if you could make it, I promise food of at least comparible (sic) quality to that which we ate in Iraq. Should be a great evening," the email read.

Mr Bossert replied from his official account: "Thanks, Jared. With a promise like that, I can't refuse. Also, if you ever need it, my personal email is (redacted)."

The now dismissed Communications Director, Anthony Scaramucci, also fell victim to the scam - he responded to what he thought was an email from the former White House Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, last weekend.

"At no stage have you acted in a way that's even remotely classy, yet you believe that's the standard by which everyone should behave towards you? General Kelly will do a fine job. I'll even admit he will do a better job than me. But the way in which that transition has come about has been diabolical. And hurtful. I don't expect a reply," the prankster wrote as Mr Priebus.

Mr Scaramucci shot back: "You know what you did. We all do. Even today. But rest assured we were prepared. A Man [sic] would apologize."
