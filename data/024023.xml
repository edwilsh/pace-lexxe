  <title>Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard had a cameo in the latest 'Game of Thrones' episode</title>

Warning: Spoilers ahead for "Game of Thrones" season seven, episode four, "Spoils of War."

Sunday night's episode of "Game of Thrones" gave fans a lot of what they wanted. "Spoils of War" featured a few reunions and battles that longtime viewers had been waiting for for years, including our first look at the damage a dragon can do to a Lannister army.

With all the action, it was easy to miss a cameo by Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard, who appeared for a brief moment as a spear-wielding Lannister soldier attempting to fight off the onslaught of the Dothraki horde. While only onscreen for a second, Syndergaard, whose fastball can break 100 mph, did get some use out of his powerful arm, throwing his spear so hard that it knocked a Dothraki off its mount.

Syndergaard is a known fan of "Game of Thrones" and has even used the show's intro as his walk-up music .After the show, he posted a few tweets expressing his excitement with the appearance.

Fans on Twitter seemed to enjoy the cameo as well.

Syndergaard has been out with an injury since late April, but the Mets are hoping that their young star will be back on the mound before the end of the season. His character, despite his accuracy with the spear, was likely burned alive by dragon fire.
