  <title>Ute smashes through shopping centre in foiled ATM robbery</title>
  <content>
A driver smashed a stolen ute through a shopping centre during a failed robbery attempt.
Video shared by Queensland Police showed the grey Isuzu dual-cab slamming into the entrance of Kallangur Fair, in Moreton Bay, on July 28.
The offender then screeches the vehicle around the centre about 4am, before stopping in front of an ATM.
Reversing with force, the ute hits the machine, causing the digital screen to detach.
The ATM is not dislodged from the ground however, so the driver has a second attempt at stealing it before he admits defeat.
He departed the Anzac Avenue centre empty handed and the vehicle was located burned out on Tamborine Circuit, Kallangur.
Detectives believe the ute was stolen from a Bellemere address overnight on July 19.
