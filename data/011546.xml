  <title>Aussie nurse jailed in Cambodia</title>
  <content>
An Australian nurse has been jailed in Cambodia for providing commercial surrogacy services.
Tammy Davis-Charles was today convicted in a Cambodian court after being found guilty of acting as an intermediary between a pregnant woman and an adoptive parent. She was sentenced to one and a half years in prison and a $1,200 fine.
She has already spent nine months in jail.
Cambodia banned commercial surrogacy last year after becoming a popular destination for would-be parents seeking women to give birth to their children.
