Genworth Mortgage Insurance has suffered a 34.7 per cent slump in half-year profit as adverse portfolio revaluations, higher delinquencies and a slip in premiums.
The lender's mortgage insurer reported net profit of $88.7 million for the six months to June 30, and revenue of $294.5 million, down 20 per cent, while the interim divend was 12 cents plus a two cent special dividend, fully franked.
Genworth also announced a $100 million, on-market share buyback and its shares were up five per cent to $3.17 at 1042 AEST.
