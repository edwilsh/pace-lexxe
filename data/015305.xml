  <title>Cops charge two with attempted murder</title>
  <content>
TWO men have been charged with the attempted murder and kidnapping after an investigation by police in northern NSW.
A critically injured 35-year-old man was found by a passer-by on the side of Kyogle Road at Kunghur on July 23 was rushed to hospital where he was treated for significant burns to his body.
The discovery prompted a major police investigation to find the perpetrators of the crime.
Officers found a burnt out, white Holden ute nearby and later made contact with a 36-year-old man who said he was with the 35-year-old the night before.
The 36-year-old told police the pair were kidnapped by a group of men that night who put them in the back of a white ute.
The older man was injured while escaping - jumping from the ute while it was in motion and hiding in nearby bushland.
After a meticulous operation, police charged a 29-year-old man on Wednesday.
Yesterday, police also arrested a 28-year-old man.
Both men were charged with attempted murder and kidnapping and both were refused bail.
