  <title>Stabbing murder of breastfeeding wife 'heinous, brutal and inexplicable', Canberra court hears</title>
  <content>
Heinous, brutal, sustained and inexplicable - that is how prosecutors have described the stabbing murder of Canberra woman Sabah Al Mdwali by her husband two years ago.
But prosecutor Shane Drumgold has stopped short of calling for a life sentence for Maged Al Harazi, 36, who was
The horrific crime was discovered by police after Al Harazi reported the death, accusing his wife's father and brother.
Ms Al Mdwali had been stabbed 57 times while she breastfed their baby in a bedroom of their home.
During the trial it emerged there had been long standing tension between the pair, partly over Al Harazi's desire to return to Yemen, when his wife wanted to stay near her family.
Al Harazi maintains
Today's hearing focussed on psychiatric material, with one expert suggesting Al Harazi had schizophrenia but another rejecting the idea.
His lawyer, Ken Archer, said there had been evidence about the state of his mental health over the years suggesting a "continuity of symptomology".
But Mr Drumgold said: "The severity of the attack is not evidence of a mental illness because we do not understand it."
Sense of entitlement at play: prosecutor

He said the crime wasn't linked to delusions but rather a sense of entitlement.
Mr Drumgold called for a strong sentence, but said he wouldn't make the case for life imprisonment.
Mr Archer acknowledged the gravity of the crime, but asked the court to consider that it was unlike similar cases, with no premeditation.
"It was apparently spontaneous and did not involve injury to others," he said.
Justice Richard Refshauge will sentence Al Harazi next week.
