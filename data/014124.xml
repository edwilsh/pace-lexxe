Perth detectives are seeking the public's help to solve an arson attack on a heritage-listed commercial property that caused $150,000 worth of damage.
The fire began at the Great Eastern Highway property in Redcliffe about 3am on July 21, and police want to speak to the driver of a white utility seen driving nearby at the time.
Rewards of up to $50,000 are available for information that leads to the identification and conviction of an arsonist.
