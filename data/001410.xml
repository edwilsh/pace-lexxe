Five minutes later, the Australian No.20 turned her marker before unleashing a curled finish past Sakiko Ikeda to put the Matildas ahead.
As half-time loomed, Kerr used her pace once more to complete the hat-trick.
The Perth Glory striker won a header in the nick of time and raced on to her own work to score a one-on-one at the second attempt before celebrating with a handstand and backflip.
Australia maintained the rage after the break, scoring a fourth through Emily Van Egmond's penalty.
The Matildas will now close out the friendly competition on Friday (AEST) against Brazil.
A win over the South Americans will mean Australia win the tournament between the four top-10 ranked nations.
