  <title>States scurry to reform retirement villages and ward off feds</title>
  <content>
In Western Australia the state's watchdog, Consumer Protection, has set up a special investigation unit to examine contracts and exit fees in the scandal-ridden retirement village sector to see if they breach the Australian Consumer Law.
It is the latest in a long line of state regulatory bodies and governments scrambling to clean up a sector that has been crying out for reform for decades.

'They will squeeze every dollar out of every resident'

Gwyneth Jones has been in a long-running battle with Aveo, but she can't move out due to the crippling fees she'd be charged.

The heightened activity ahead of a meeting scheduled by the federal and state consumer affairs ministers to discuss the effectiveness of legislation and enforcement arrangements that cover the retirement village industry.
It follows Four Corners that exposed unfair practices in the sector including complex and opaque contracts, excessive fees, high-pressure sales tactics, punitive exit fees and outlandish refurbishment and reinstatement costs of up to $60,000 on a small one or two-bedroom unit, all of which have turned retirement village living into a financial sinkhole for some.

While retirement villages are regulated by state legislation, their contracts are subject to Australian Consumer Law, which prohibits unfair contract terms and is federal legislation.
As a rule, state governments don't like relinquishing power to their federal counterparts. But there is a strong case to do just that in this case..

A parliamentary report in 2007, Older People and the Law, recommended the ACCC play a stronger role in monitoring consumer protection of retirement village residents. It said "should there be insufficient improvement in the level of protection for consumers, the Australian government should consider regulating this industry using its powers under corporations legislation".

A decade on, things have got worse.
A cynic could be forgiven for thinking that the spectre of losing control to the feds played a role in the recent activity in the sector by the various states.
For WA's part, the shiny new special investigation unit of senior investigators and lawyers promises to focus on retirement village contracts, particularly the types of exit fees paid by residents when they leave or die.

Across the country, NSW launched an inquiry, headed up by Kathryn Greiner, along with a compliance audit by NSW Fair Trading, the release of a new online calculator to help residents determine estimated costs, and an overhaul of the Retirement Villages Regulation.
Meanwhile, as the Andrews government continues to sit on a relatively weak set of recommendations despite hearing some explosive testimony during an inquiry earlier this year, Consumer Affairs Victoria has released an options paper relating to the review of internal dispute resolution processes under the Retirement Villages Act 1986 (the Act) and is inviting submissions.
A root-and-branch review of retirement village regulation is needed

One of those submissions, jointly written by the Consumer Action Law Centre (CALC), Housing for the Aged Action Group (HAAG) and COTA, says any improvement in internal dispute resolution processes is welcomed but maintains that a root-and-branch review of retirement village regulation is needed.
"Without significant reform of retirement village regulation, as recommended by the Parliamentary inquiry into the retirement housing sector, the minor changes recommended in the options paper to internal dispute resolution procedures are unlikely to have any major overall benefit to residents," it says.
At a minimum, it believes the following reforms are required: the establishment of an ombudsman to resolve disputes between retirement housing operators and residents; stronger regulation of fees and charges, particularly exit fees; greater clarity and consistency in governing legislation and contracts; and robust training and accreditation standards.
It says the underlying assumption of the options paper is that the vast majority of residents are satisfied, and that disputes are reasonably rare. "This language has been used by industry for many years to ward off regulation, and is based on so-called 'independent' surveys."
It says the main survey relied upon by the retirement village industry is not "independent" and is not a member of the Australian Market & Social Research Society (AMSRS) after the ABC's Media Watch raised questions about the company's methodology.
"Regardless of questions of reliability of these industry surveys, indicators of 'satisfaction' are in any case not useful indicators of whether there are sufficient protections for residents," the joint submission says.
The retirement village sector is big business. It is also falling through the cracks. While the states continue to play politics, unscrupulous operators will continue to flourish from a business model that has been designed to "
