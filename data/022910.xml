  <title>Watch: Mills embraces indigenous heritage</title>
  <content>
PATTY Mills has been making his way across Australia, and has taken a lot of time to embrace his rich heritage.
The San Antonio Spurs guard was recently named an official ambassador for the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games, with Townsville being the latest stop on his agenda.
While in the far north Queensland town, Mills danced with some local Torres Strait Islanders.

Patty Mills embraces heritage
To cap off Mills' eventful day, he crossed paths with North Queensland Cowboys captain Johnathan Thurston, who happened to be riding his bike in the area.
While his role as an ambassador has kept Mills extremely busy this off-season - the pressure has been off, since the 28-year-old signed a four-year, $US50 million deal with the Spurs - he's also been promoting his new series of children's books.
