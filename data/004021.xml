  <title>Canberra Now: NLA's Nolan project, and brothers plead guilty to rapes</title>
  <content>
Good morning Canberra,
It's a frosty morning, but we're expecting a sunny day to follow - not bad after all that rain. It dipped only just below freezing overnight, and the weather bureau has forecast a maximum of 15 degrees.
Let's take a look at what's making headlines today.
MoU to become law

A controversial agreement that allows UnionsACT to vet companies vying for government contracts will be written into law next year.
Chief Minister Andrew Barr told the weekend's ACT Labor conference the government would would establish a "local jobs code" to ensure "worker safety, fair pay and conditions on public projects" within the next 12 months.

The federal and territory Liberals have previously spoken out against the agreement with Canberra Liberals industrial relations spokesman Andrew Wall saying "serious questions" needed to be answered on who's running the show.

A Canberra man who sold cocaine to NRL stars Jesse Bromwich and Kevin Proctor told police he wanted to "get on it with his heroes".
Adrian Mark Crowther, 45, was fined more than $5000 after he was captured on CCTV cutting lines of the drug on his mobile phone for two men to snort through a rolled bank note in Civic on May 6.
Magistrate Bernadette Boss acknowledged the players were Crowther's "sporting idols" but said a man of his age should not have encouraged younger men to engage in drug-taking behaviour.

Plastics-to-fuel company Foy has missed the deadline for paying the balance owing to the ACT government on its block of land in Hume.
Foy owes just less than $3 million on the block it bought last year from the Land Development Agency, but Kirsten Lawson reports the company missed settlement on June 26 this year.
The government said "the parties [were] in discussion as to a completion date" but otherwise refused to comment, and Foy did not respond to efforts to make contact.
There's heaps of different information floating around and it's all a bit confusing, but you can read more .
Brothers plead guilty to sex worker attacks

Two brothers have pleaded guilty to rape and aggravated robbery charges that stemmed from two violent attacks against sex workers in the ACT. 
Mohammed Alabbasi, 22, and Ahmed Al Abbasi, 31, switched their pleas in the ACT Supreme Court on Friday after previously indicating they would fight the charges.
That means the men will avoid trial following the alleged rapes in separate incidents in apartments in Reid and Braddon in 2016.
