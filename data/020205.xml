 The Eastlake Demons can secure a home final this week after they stormed home to beat the Queanbeyan Tigers by four points at Manuka Oval on Sunday.

The victory means if Eastlake can topple Ainslie in the final round on Saturday they'll secure third place and host the Tigers in an elimination final in two weeks.
Demons coach Peter McGrath said playing finals footy at home was important but he's more pleased that his men now have the mental edge over Queanbeyan heading into the post season.

"Psychologically it was great for us to win, they did a pretty good job on us six weeks ago so it was important the boys stuck it out today," McGrath said.
"Looking at the boys in the rooms they were happy with win but there was definitely and element of 'we're not satisfied yet' and we are really looking forward to two weeks time.

"We'd obviously rather play at Manuka than Queanbeyan but we've won on their home deck this season, either way we're not getting too far ahead of ourselves."
Demons midfielder Sam Burge finished best-on-ground after booting three goals, while his teammate Harry Bryant and Tigers' forward Tim Clowry also bagged a trio.
"It wasn't the most attractive game of footy but credit to both sides, it could have been anyone's game. We contested the ball well after quarter time and it ended up going our way, so we're very happy," McGrath said.
"Sam Burge was really good, I put it on him last week that I wanted him to lift and he did that with his physically around the contest, him and Alex Wilson in the back half were standouts."
Queanbeyan can still finish third if they upset table-toppers Belconnen Magpies next week and Eastlake fall against Ainslie.
Meanwhile, the match between Belconnen and the Gungahlin Jets was abandoned in the final two minutes when Mark Smith went down with a neck injury after a sling tackle.
An ambulance was called and the Magpies young gun was taken to the hospital but club president Scott Reid expects the 20-year-old to make a full recovery.
"I think he'll be okay, the medical people weren't taking any chances so he was taken to hospital just to make sure. Everything seemed to moving in the right way and he was responding well so we hope he'll be okay," Reid said.
