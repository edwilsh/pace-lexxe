  <title>SA State Library evacuated over chemical incident, two taken to Royal Adelaide Hospital</title>
  <content>
Two people were taken to hospital after South Australia's State Library was evacuated because of a chemical scare caused by paint fumes.
Dozens of people were forced out of the library complex on North Terrace in Adelaide about 12:30pm. The main part of the library has since reopened.
Metropolitan Fire Service (MFS) and SA Ambulance crews have attended the scene.
"Apparently there was some sort of chemical scare," said ABC Radio Adelaide presenter Peter Goers, who was on his way to a football exhibition at the library when the evacuation occurred.
"There's a smell of ammonia in the building apparently I'm told by people leaving."
SA Ambulance confirmed two people had been taken to the Royal Adelaide Hospital and were in a stable condition.
Parts of the building are undergoing renovations, with extensive scaffolding outside the Mortlock wing.
Library spokesman Beverly Scott said the workers were painting window frames before the incident happened.
"[That] caused some fumes ... to enter the building in the first instance into the Mortlock chamber," she said.
Ms Scott said a security guard was affected by the fumes, but said she did not know how many had received medical treatment.
"Visitors to the library ... say they were duly treated by the ambulance people," she said.
The Mortlock wing remains closed, but Ms Scott said people had since been allowed back into the Spence wing, which is the main part of the library complex.
She said MFS was working to rid paint fumes from the building.
