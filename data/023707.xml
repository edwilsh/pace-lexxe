  <title>Retail spending slows, construction activity surges to 12-year high</title>
  <content>
There has been some positive developments for construction activity, but mixed news on retail spending - depending on how one looks at it.
But the latest economic data paints an overall positive picture about Australia's economy going forward.
Out with department stores, but more take-away

Last financial year, Australia's retail spending grew at its slowest pace in four years.
That was the conclusion reached by Commsec, when it noted that retail spending increased by 3.2 per cent in the 2016/17 financial year.
Australians spent more than $308 billion on the retail sector, or a bit over $240 per week on retail goods, which coincided with a $28 rise in the average wage.
"It is clear that Aussie consumers are spending, but selectively, no doubt using technology to shop around and get the best price - either at home or overseas," Commsec's chief economist Craig James said.
But what have consumers been spending their money on?
Take-away food was the category which saw the biggest increase in seven years (+8.4 per cent to $14.28 per week).  This was, in part, because the price of take-away became 1.6 per cent more expensive.
There was also a substantial boost in spending on clothes (+4.1 per cent to $12.59 per week).

Interestingly, eight years ago, the reverse was true - when the average Australian spent more on clothing than take-away food.
Clothing prices have become far more affordable in the past eight years.
However, consumers spent less on department stores (-2.2 per cent at $14.54 per week), as well as good old-fashioned newspapers and books (-0.6 per cent to $2.52 per week).
"Consumers have fretted about weak wage growth, and this has led to price-sensitive shopping," Mr James said.
"But retailers have actually responded by trimming prices, thus supporting sales."
Looking at a narrower period - just the June quarter - a different story emerges.
In those three months, retail spending actually grew at its fastest pace - compared to the previous quarters over the past eight years.
Retail spending rose 1.5 per cent in the June quarter, partially because retail prices have been flat, or even cheaper.
Mr James said this figure is important because "consumer spending drives the Australian economy,  accounting for 57 per cent of GDP".
However, he warned that the entry of Amazon into the Australian market means retailers will not see pressure "let up any time soon" and they will need to "keep costs controlled and focus on non-price strategies to drive spending".
Construction surges

In contrast, construction activity surged last month - its fastest rate of growth in almost 12 years.
The Performance of Construction Index rose 4.5 points to 60.5 in July, according to the latest data from the Australian Industry Group (AIG) and Housing Industry Association (HIA).
A result above 50 means the industry is expanding (whereas below 50 indicates contraction).  So the latest result is clearly a strong one.
"The ongoing boom in apartment construction in metro areas, combined with investment in infrastructure projects, is ensuring strong conditions across the sector," HIA principal economist Tim Reardon said.
The major drivers to the growth in construction were house building (up 3.5 points to 62.4) and commercial construction (up 9.8 points to 64.3)
In fact, commercial construction hit its highest level in since September 2005 as the number of projects entering the work pipeline increased.
"House building recorded its fastest pace in 3.5 years on the back of a solid backlog of work and ongoing strength in demand," the AIG and HIA noted.
"In addition, the apartment building sector returned to modest growth after contracting in June, supported by a fourth consecutive month of expansion in new orders."
