  <title>Man bashed in wild Mandurah brawl</title>
  <content>
CAMERAS have captured the moment a 24-year-old man was smashed in the face and knocked down in a fight in Mandurah.
The 24-year-old victim was out the front of the Rollercoaster nightclub in the Smart Street Mall around 2am on Sunday when he was hit.
The victim, who does not want to be identified, told Seven News that he was trying to break up the fight when he was hit.
It wasn't the only fight in Mandurah last weekend, with police called to a hotel on Mandurah Terrace after a man was hit.
That man suffered cuts and bruises to his face.
Mandurah man Clinton Salter, who was assaulted when he left work two years ago, says he is sick of the violence in the area.
"The more fights that happen, the more people don't go out," he said.
Mr Salter was left battered and bruised after his attack, where he was punched 19 times.
The latest crime statistics reveal that since June last year, assaults in Mandurah have decreased.
