  <title>Another Lib MP backs vote on gay marriage</title>
  <content>
The Turnbull government is under renewed pressure from within its own ranks to allow a free parliamentary vote on same-sex marriage.
A week out from parliament returning from its long winter break, openly-gay Liberal MP Trevor Evans says he is in discussion with a number of his colleagues about different options to settle the issue.
"But I think the quickest and most likely course now is to allow politicians to have a free vote ... and I support that," he told The Australian on Monday.
