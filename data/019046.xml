  <content>
US President Donald Trump has been briefed at his New Jersey golf club on the search for three missing US Marines off the Queensland coast after their military heli-plane crashed into the sea.

The US Marines Corps said 23 personnel aboard were rescued and the search and rescue mission continues off the coast of Shoalwater Bay for the missing three.
Mr Trump, on the first day of his planned 17-day "working vacation" at his Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, had been briefed on the incident by his new chief-of-staff John Kelly, a White House official told reporters.

"The President will be having meetings with chief-of-staff General Kelly, other White House advisers and lawmakers while at Bedminster over the next two weeks," the official said.
Australian Defence Minister Marise Payne said she has briefed Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and spoken with US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to offer Australia's support in anyway that can be of assistance.

"I can confirm no Australian Defence Force personnel were on board the aircraft," Ms Payne said in a statement.

The Osprey had launched from the USS Bonhomme Richard amphibious assault ship and was conducting regularly scheduled operations when the aircraft entered the water.
The Osprey is a tiltrotor aircraft with helicopter and plane capabilities.
Small boats and aircraft from the Bonhomme Richard immediately began search and rescue efforts.
The circumstances of the mishap are under investigation.
"I have briefed Prime Minister Turnbull and spoken with Secretary Mattis this evening to offer Australia's support in anyway that can be of assistance," Ms Payne said.
"Our thoughts are with the crew and families affected."
