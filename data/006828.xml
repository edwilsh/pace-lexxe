  <title>KISS frontman Gene Simmons and newborn calf share similar face markings</title>
  <content>
Rock and roll all night and party by eating hay: a newborn calf in the US has grabbed attention for its striking resemblance to the face paint worn by KISS frontman Gene Simmons.
The rocker tweeted his fascination with the black-and-white calf, saying: "This is real, folks!!!"
The calf was born on Friday, unfortunately not in Detroit Rock City but at a ranch near Kerrville, Texas.
Heather Taccetta, who lives at the ranch with her family, said the calf belongs to her grandmother.
Its name? Genie, of course.
Local tourism site Hill Country Visitor questioned whether the rocker had any part to play in the calf's parentage.
"Gene Simmons, were where you on [or] about November 25, 2016?"
The post continued: "Now obviously, we can't serve this fine specimen, we may just keep Genie as we call her, as a mascot for the steakhouse."
Ms Taccetta said Genie would not be sold for slaughter and would stay with the family forever.
