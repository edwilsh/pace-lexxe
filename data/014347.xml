AN EMERGENT situation has been declared after a truck carrying a "volatile substance" reportedly burst into flames on the M1 at Loganholme.
Both directions of the motorway remain blocked as fire crews work to extinguish the blaze, which is understood to be under control.
An exclusion zone, which encompasses a 1km radius around the crash site, has been established amid fears the truck was carrying a "volatile substance", which police have since confirmed is hydrochloric acid.
Police have urged motorists to be mindful of delays and have encouraged nearby residents to stay indoors.
Scientific officers have also been called to the scene.
Emergency services were initially called to the incident about 8.40am when the truck caught fire.
Motorists trapped behind the vehicle on the southbound lane should exit via Bryants Rd.
