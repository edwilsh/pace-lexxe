'Justine didn't have to die'

Minneapolis police chief Janee Harteau has dedicated her team towards getting justice for Justine Damond, stating she 'didn't have to die' after being shot and killed by a police officer responding to a 911 call.

The former chief resigned after Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges announced less than a week after Ms Damond's death she had "lost confidence in the chief's ability to lead us further".

Officer Mohamed Noor arrived in a patrol car and shot Ms Damond dead as she approached the driver's side window.
Officer Noor and his partner did not have their body or dash cameras on.

Ms Harteau continued her holiday for four days instead of immediately returning to Minneapolis after Ms Damond's death.
