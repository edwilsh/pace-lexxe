  <title>Indigenous culture and STEM subjects go hand in hand, mathematician tells students</title>

Indigenous culture goes hand in hand with science, technology engineering and maths (STEM), according to a mathematician who is encouraging more young Aboriginal people to study the subjects.
Chris Matthews is working to address the education gap that last year saw 48 per cent of South Australian Indigenous year 12 students complete at least one STEM subject, compared to 73 per cent of Year 12s overall.
The Noonuccal man, who heads up the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Mathematics Alliance, has told a group of Indigenous students from schools in Adelaide's northern suburbs to be proud of their heritage while having the self-belief to tackle STEM subjects.
He said a "European perspective" dominated the disciplines, even though Aboriginal culture had its own forms of science and maths.
"[It's about] making sure our children understand they come from a sophisticated culture, and looking more at what we used to do in our way of thinking about the world," he said.
Dr Matthews told the students that throughout the history of science, a lot of people who made leaps forward were those who thought outside the box.
"One of the classic examples is a bloke named [Michael] Faraday, who connected the forces of electricity and magnetism," he told them.
"Faraday belonged to a religious sect who believed in circular patterns, and only because of that different way in seeing the world could he make that connection."
Dr Matthews said Indigenous people were increasingly enjoying successful careers in fields including engineering and astronomy.
'Stay in school, work hard and don't give up'

At an Aboriginal Learners' Day at Paralowie R-12 School, students have worked with Indigenous mentors and teachers to develop a more culturally-suitable STEM unit.
And a Salisbury Primary School student named Tyrell said he was inspired by Dr Matthews.
"He [Dr Matthews] said that he wasn't good at maths when he was younger but then it started to grow on him," Tyrell said.
"When I finish school I would like to study engineering at university - there are even jobs that haven't even been created yet that will need [people who have studied] STEM subjects.
"The main messages I got from the day was to stay in school, work hard and not give up what I believe in."
Dr Matthews said, ultimately, STEM subjects were worth pursuing by children from all backgrounds.
"People can inform science in a whole range of different ways, and the more we value different world views, you never know what's going to happen in the future," he said.
