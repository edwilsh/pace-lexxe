  <title>Peace at last! Pay war finally over</title>
  <content>
THE cricket pay war is over.
Foxsports.com.au can reveal that on Thursday afternoon the Australian Cricketers' Association and Cricket Australia finally signed off on an agreement document that will form the basis of the new Memorandum of Understanding.
It brings an end to a battle that stretches back 10 months and threatened to derail tours of Bangladesh, India and a home Ashes series.
The central problem was a revenue sharing model that the governing body argued was outdated, but the players maintained was integral to the future prosperity of the game.
In the end, the two parties agreed on what will be termed a 'modernised revenue sharing model,' with female cricketers, state players and the elite males all sharing in a slice of the overall pie.
Cricket Australia Chief Executive James Sutherland was bunkered down with his negotiators and ACA bosses on Thursday.
A resolution had appeared likely earlier in the week and even late into the night on Wednesday, but it wasn't until after lunch on Thursday when the two organisations shook hands to end the most bitter feud in Australian cricket since the late 1970s.
Th resolution means arbitration has been avoided following Sutherland's threat last Friday when negotiations had stalled yet again.
Players have been unemployed since July 1.
It means Australia's tour of Bangladesh - the first since 2006 - will go ahead as planned.
A media conference has been scheduled for 4.30pm Thursday afternoon in Melbourne. Watch it live on Fox Sports 500.
