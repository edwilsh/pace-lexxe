  <title>VIDEO: Amazing rescue of trapped kangaroo goes viral</title>
  <content>
THIS could be the most Aussie thing you see all week - a Darling Downs man rescuing a kangaroo stuck in a narrow trench.  

Goondiwindi man Fritz White came across a kangaroo lying face up in a trench yesterday while at work.

The footage, shot just south of Goondiwindi, shows him reaching down into the hole to grab the kangaroo's paws.

The kangaroo struggles as Mr White pulls him from the ground.

The rescue only took about one minute and the kangaroo can be seen happily hopping away afterwards.

The video was uploaded yesterday afternoon and it has already gone viral.

It has been viewed by 100,000 people and shared more than 850 times.
