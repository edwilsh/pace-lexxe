Australian market today

This is the first week of earnings season and investors will be paying close attention to the results of Rio Tinto.
Rio, one of the world's largest mining companies, will announce its first-half earnings about 4.30pm today (AEST).
The company's shareholders are expecting underlying profit to triple, as well as a big jump in dividends.
UBS analyst Glyn Lawcock's estimate is that Rio will report $US4.2 billion ($5.3 billion) in underlying earnings - which is slightly higher than market expectations.
"All business units are forecast to be profit making ... with the exception of [its] copper and diamonds [business]", which he is forecasting will break even.
In addition, he expects Rio's revenue to get a boost from its iron ore earnings (an estimated 89 per cent boost to US$3.3 billion, compared to last year), and the .
Seven West Media will also release its full-year results, and it is likely to see a drop in profit given the media industry is seeing tough times.
In economic news, the Bureau of Statistics will release its latest building approvals figures - which are a gauge of future construction.
Economists polled by Reuters are expecting approvals in June to have lifted by 1.5 per cent, an improvement over May's 5.6 per cent drop.
What happened on Wall St?

Once again, the Dow Jones hit a fresh record - close to striking the 22,000 points mark, but not quite there yet.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also put in solid performances.
It was a day where almost every sector did well, except for health care. The sectors which drove most of the US stock market's gains were financials (particularly the big banks) and utilities.
This week is a busy one for US earnings season - about three-quarters of the companies which have reported so far have exceeded market expectations.
Apple shares surged by 6.1 per cent after the close of trade (at 8.25am AEST).
The tech giant had forecast current-quarter revenue that was largely higher than Wall Street's estimates.
Its revenue was US$45.4 billion in the current quarter, and it was lifted by strong iPad sales (US$1 billion higher than expected).
Apple's service business (including sales from its App Store) also got a 21.6 per cent boost.
However, its revenue from the Greater China region fell 9.5 per cent to US$8 billion in the latest quarter - due to Chinese consumers switching to newer domestic offerings.
