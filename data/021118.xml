A knife-wielding man who was shot by police during a confrontation in northern NSW has died in hospital.
Police first tasered then shot the man, who they say was holding a knife, after they arrived at a unit in Grafton after a report of a disturbance on Sunday afternoon.
The man was taken to hospital in a critical condition and died overnight with police on Monday saying a critical incident team will now investigate the circumstances of the shooting.
