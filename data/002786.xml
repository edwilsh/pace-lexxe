  <title>AGL Energy's smart meter auction attracts bigwigs</title>
  <content>
AGL Energy has quietly started a sale process for its smart meter business, Active Stream, which has piqued the interest of some big name investors. 
Street Talk understands New Zealand's electricity giant Vector, Macquarie Group and KKR & Co's Calvin Capital are among parties that are in-and-around an auction. 
It is being run by boutique firm Ironstone Capital, which is said to be close to short listing bidders to go through to a second round. Sources suggested the business could be worth around $100 million. 
AGL's interim accounts outlined growth in the Active Stream digital meters, but the commentary has followed a restructure of several of its newer business lines. 

In December, AGL announced that its Distributed Energy Services (DES) unit, which was previously managed through the New Energy segment, would be incorporated into group operations. 

DES included the Active Stream business, the national assets unit and solar and storage operations. 
It is unclear whether market reforms being implemented late this year have influenced AGL's decision to assess a sale of Active Stream. Its website notes that the December changes will introduce national standards that encourage new businesses to enter the market.
The reforms will see smart digital meters progressively made available to all customers.
AGL's deliberations come as AusNet Services also considers options for its metering business Select Solutions.

Globally, the smart meter market has attracted a string of big names.
Last week, Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing made a leap into the industry by agreeing to buy German smart meter business Ista International.
Macquarie claims it is the largest smart meter funder in the UK and the biggest independent meter funder in Australia. It defines independent as separate to retail energy producers.
KKR portfolio company, Calvin Capital, finances smart meter installations on behalf of energy suppliers.
