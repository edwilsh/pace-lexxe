POWERFUL: Blending technology with humanity.

From nanorobots injected into the neocortex that will one day relegate your smartphone and laptop to the status of the mobile brick, to Elon Musk's Hyperloop that will take us from New York to Washington in 29 minutes, technology is smashing boundaries.
I do wonder why it is often easier to explore new frontiers than it is to solve our existing humanitarian problems. A quick look at the United Nations Global Goals confronts you with the reality that we are far from realising a world where poverty, quality education, gender equality, clean water, peace and hunger can be 'ticked off' the list of 'would be nice to haves'. We have space probes that investigate the possibility of life on mars. Why is it up to Thankyou Water and other organisations like them, to tackle world-water and other humanitarian crises? 
In the words of Tom Kelley from IDEO, "Our best work comes as we blend technology with humanity ... what will humans need?"
Christina Gerakiteys is the CEO of Ideation at Work
