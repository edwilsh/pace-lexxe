  <title>Speeders nabbed in rural road crackdown</title>
  <content>
MORE than 100 drivers have allegedly been caught speeding in the first week of a police crackdown on drivers using rural roads.
Somerville Highway Patrol officers are running Operation Hisser which focuses on rural roads with speed limits of 80km/h or higher.
In the first week of the operation officers have allegedly detected:
120 speeding offences;
TWO drug drivers;
FOUR unlicensed drivers;
ONE suspended driver; and
SEVEN unregistered vehicles.
Sergeant Peter Martin from Somerville Highway Patrol said the operation would be run over several months.
"Drivers need to be aware of the speed zone that they are driving in and always drive to the conditions," he said.
"Our aim is to decrease the level of road trauma caused by speeding and to challenge the belief out there that low level speeding is safe.
"We will continue to focus on these roads to ensure that they are safe for all road users."
