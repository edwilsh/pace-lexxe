  <content>
Bitcoin is above $US2,900 this afternoon for the first time mid-June, ahead of a likely split in the currency due within hours (10.30pm eastern Australian time/1.30pm GMT).

A short time ago, Bitcoin was trading at $US2,912, not far off its all-time high of $US2,980, reached on 12 June this year.

The deadline for the implementation of the revised SegWit2 operating platform  and analysts are forecasting that it won't go ahead.
