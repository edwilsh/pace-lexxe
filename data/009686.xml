  <title>Moreton Bay have a magic night in FFA Cup</title>
  <content>
SUBSTITUTE Paul Mikula went from villain to hero as Moreton Bay United advanced to the FFA Cup round-of-16 with a 4-2 win in extra-time over Broadmeadow Magic at Wolter Park on Wednesday night.
United seemed certain to win the game in regulation time, leading 2-1 late after fighting back from a goal down.
But disaster struck the hosts in the dying stages of normal time when referee Chris Beath pointed to the spot after Mikula fouled the Magic's Kale Bradbury.
Bradbury stood up and converted the penalty to level scores at 2-2 and ensure extra-time.
But Mikula, who decided to play despite the death of his mother on Sunday, scored his NPL Queensland side's crucial third goal in the 106th minute of an enthralling contest.
Two minutes later fellow substitute Declan Smith sealed the win with United's fourth goal as NPL Northern NSW club Magic - by then down to 10 men following the dismissal of Dino Fajkovic for a second bookable offence - finally succumbed.
United wasn't the only Queensland side to win last night, with Gold Coast City also advancing to the Cup round-of-16 with a 3-1 victory over Western Knights at Palm Beach.
Earlier at Wolter Park, Magic wasted a great chance to take a 15th minute lead when James Virgili had a penalty saved by United goalkeeper Jordan Thurtell.
But it was only a matter of time before Magic grabbed the lead, with Fajkovic putting the visitors ahead in the 18th minute, finishing past an advancing Thurtell.
United were disappointing in the first-half, but responding perhaps to a half-time roasting from coach Adam Piddick, started the second half well.
They were rewarded when skipper Alex Janovski equalised from the penalty spot in the 72nd minute.
United then went ahead two minutes later via a sweet finish from substitute Lachlan Strogusz.
But the Magic weren't ready to give up, with Bradbury's late penalty ensuring an extra 30 minutes of action.
However, United regained control in extra-time to end 10-man Broadmeadow's Cup run.
Elsewhere last night, Sydney FC thrashed Darwin Rovers 8-0, while Blacktown City upset Central Coast Mariners 3-2.
