  <title>Pornography addiction, erectile dysfunction occurring at younger age, sex educator says</title>
  <content>
A Tasmanian sex educator says some young high school students are addicted to pornography and have unrealistic ideas about sexual relationships.
Peter Baldwin from the Sexual Assault Support Service (SASS) said some students had already been exposed to "hard-core" pornography in primary school.
"Grade seven students have asked us, why this isn't being taught younger," he said.
"We have had young people asking us questions and seeking support around possible porn addiction."
Mr Baldwin said it was important for parents to have open and transparent dialogue with their children.
"It may make you blush, it might be a challenging conversation, but at the end of the day you will know that you have had that conversation with your young person and they haven't found out that information through friends, rumours or the internet," he said.
Mother's reality check over sons' exposure

Tasmanian mother Jane was forced to have that discussion with her children earlier than she had expected after she discovered her seven- and nine-year-old sons had accessed pornography online.
"I wasn't expecting it to be a conversation with children that young - I thought it would be a teenage conversation.
"It was a reality check about 'this is the world we live in'."
Jane said as she raised the topic with her sons she assured them they were not in trouble.
"My younger one was very uncomfortable and said he wanted to be a normal boy who played outside," she said.
"But my older son, it was more complex. He was embarrassed that I knew and it took a bit more discussion.
"For me, it was important for him to know why I was not comfortable with it and about issues of respect, particularly respect for women.
"I wanted to talk about how unrealistic it is and how the picture of sexuality was not an accurate one."
Porn promotes dangerous notions of consent

Mr Baldwin said pornography affected young people's attitudes towards and beliefs about women.

"Tolerating violence towards women is a negative impact of high porn use," he said.
"It's also affecting young people biologically, where there are reports coming out about erectile dysfunction being an issue for young men for the first time in human history."
Mr Baldwin said pornography also gave young people the wrong idea about consent, which could be a "recipe for disaster".
"It could influence young people's ideas about what sex is, and then they may choose to go and pursue those sex acts they have witnessed in pornography without attaining consent properly," he said.
"Someone is going to get hurt and someone else may get involved in the legal justice system."
'A more open discussion is needed'

Jane said parents, schools and society needed to discuss the issue openly.
"As a mother, I really want to raise boys who are good men in the world, and I feel pretty resentful that the pornography industry has encroached upon that space," she said.
She said education about pornography and the associated risks should be introduced into primary schools.
"I believe the education system could do more to have discussions around respect and particularly around what the pornography industry is about, even though that is confronting for us," he said.
Tasmanian Association of State School Organisations vice-president Lisa Gillard said such lessons should also involve parents.
"I think if we go down that road we as parents need to be involved in whatever curriculum is brought up, as parents we need to be involved in the process," Ms Gillard said.
"It is a real concern because we as parents would like to have control over when we expose our children to any form of sexual education.
"And pornography is not the right form of education."
