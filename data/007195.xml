  <title>Webjet closes in on acquisition, prepares raising</title>
  <content>
Fund managers are bracing for an equity raising at Webjet, with the company expected to announce an offer to help fund its latest acquisition. 
Sources said Webjet was seeking to buy Jac Travel, a business to business travel agent based in the UK. 
A deal is expected as early as Wednesday. UBS and Credit Suisse are said to be on hand to manage a capital raising.
The acquisition is expected to be worth about $200 million. 

Webjet shares went into a trading halt on Wednesday morning. 
The acquisition comes at an interesting time for the company after it last week told investors of a disagreement with its auditor BDO over its fiscal year financial statements.
