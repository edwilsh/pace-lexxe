  <title>Strangles inquiry heats up as charges laid</title>
  <content>
RACING NSW Stewards have issued charges against former Godolphin Australia employees Henry Plumptre and John Oâ„¢Shea as the strangles inquiry gets set to continue on Friday.

Former Godolphin Australia managing director Plumptre and former head trainer O'Shea were presented with charges on Thursday in relation to Godolphin racehorse Polemic being infected with strangles, a highly contagious infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract, in August 2016.

Plumptre was issued with one charge under AR64K(2) for not reporting to Racing NSW as soon as possible that Polemic was confirmed as being infected with strangles from on or about August 5 last year.

O'Shea was issued with two charges - the first under AR175(l) for being a party to Plumptre committing a breach of AR64K(2) for not reporting to Racing NSW as soon as possible that Polemic was confirmed as being infected with strangles from on or about August 4 last year.

O'Shea has also been charged under AR175(g) of providing false and/or misleading evidence in a stewards' interview on June 16 and a stewards' inquiry on June 27.

The hearing of the charges has been scheduled to be conducted at Racing NSW headquarters at 10:30am on Friday.
