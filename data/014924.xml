  <title>Couture masterpieces on show</title>
  <content>
INTERNATIONALLY celebrated design label Paolo Sebastian is celebrating its 10 birthday and the Adelaide Fashion Festival and Art Gallery of South Australia are coming to the party.
Masterpieces from the archive of local designer Paul Vasileff's couture house will go on display alongside the gallery's collection of historic European art.
The free exhibition in the Melrose Wing will run October 7 to December 10.
Following on from the success of its Fashion Icons exhibition, the gallery is also setting up a Fashion Fund to raise money for the acquisition of important and influential pieces of Australian and international fashion.
Vasileff, who is the Young Australian of the Year and last night was named Entrepreneur of the Year at the South Australian EY Entrepreneur of the Year at Adelaide Oval, said he was looking forward to showcasing a decade of his Paolo Sebastian designs.
"I think art above all else should inspire us and create emotion and tell a story and I think fashion has that same ability, so it's only natural they go hand-in-hand," he said.
The Adelaide Fashion Festival runs October 11 to 15.
