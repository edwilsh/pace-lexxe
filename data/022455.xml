  <title>'Some truths will come out' of Power's horror loss</title>
  <content>
PORT Adelaide players will be made to sit through their worst performance of the year in order to keep their finals hopes from slipping away.

The Power are still reeling from Sunday's 84-point record thumping at the hands of cross-town rivals Adelaide at Adelaide Oval.

"You can't wipe that, you've got to show it," Power assistant coach Brendon Lade said.

"Some truths have to come out and they will.

"We'll address it and we'll get better."

In better news for the Power, star midfielder Chad Wingard will train this week in a bid to prove his fitness for Sunday's clash with Collingwood at Adelaide Oval.

However, defender Matthew Broadbent will miss at least another week with his own ankle complaint.
