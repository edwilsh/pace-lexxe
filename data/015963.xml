  <title>Costco fuels petrol possibility in outer east</title>
  <content>
GROCERY giant Costco says it has its "eyes open" for future opportunities to open a petrol station near the Ringwood store.
The warehouse giant aims to establish fuel stations at all of its outlets, and plans to open one at its new warehouse in Epping next year.

Costco's store at Moorabbin Airport already has a fuel station.
But Costco Wholesale Australia managing director and country manager Patrick Noone said there were "a number of reasons" that it wasn't always possible to open a petrol station at its warehouses.
"In the case of the Ringwood warehouse, we do not currently have anything to confirm about gaining a fuel station in the area," Mr Noone said.
"We always have our eyes open for future opportunities, though."
The Ringwood store opened in Bond St in 2013.
