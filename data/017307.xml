THE similarities should have astounded investigators.All lived in the Eastlakes area, all were young and attractive and all went missing within four months of each other, snatched at night while alone.Vanished into thin air.But it took decades before the disappearances of Leanne Goodall, Robyn Hickie and Amanda Robinson were taken seriously as abduction and murders, let alone whether they could even be linked.Today marks the 30th anniversary of Amanda Robinson's disappearance, the last of the three missing girls cases that have become to represent all that is evil about the Hunter Region.The 14-year-old was last seen about 400 metres from her home in Lake Road, Swansea on April 21, 1979.She had been to a school dance at Gateshead with friends.Her disappearance came 13 days after Robyn Hickie, 18, went missing after being last seen on the Pacific Highway at Belmont.Several months earlier, on December 30, 1978, Leanne Goodall, 20, was last seen alive at the Star Hotel after earlier being dropped off at Muswellbrook by her brother to catch a train.The three women had never met, but their stories would become intertwined as a crack police unit, Strike Force Fenwick, was set up in the late 1990s.Their families have also become close.The mothers of Amanda and Leanne, Anne Robinson and Beth Leen, have stood side-by-side many times pleading with the public to help find their children.They find some solace in the fact that each knows how the other is feeling.But 30 years down the track, the lack of answers still haunts them.They cannot grieve at a gravesite.Their hearts still skip a beat every time there are reports of remains being found.'We still celebrate her birthday, we all get together," Mrs Leen said."You think of it all year but that is a day when we all get together."And when a body turns up you really think, you are sort of waiting and wondering."And they are still waiting and wondering when they can find their girls and give them some sort of peace.Information can be forwarded to Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
