  <title>Suicide must stop being an option for Indigenous people, Kimberley woman tells Prime Minister</title>
  <content>
A young Aboriginal woman in Western Australia's Kimberley whose uncle took his own life has told Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull suicide must stop being an option for her people.
Tonii Skeen's meeting with Mr Turnbull coincided with  who decided to end their lives.
Ms Skeen, 21, said suicide happened so often in her community because so many young people had witnessed it.
"My dad's youngest brother committed suicide while my dad was away at a suicide prevention course and myself and my younger brother found him," she said.
"I was 10 years old when that had happened.
"Suicide shouldn't be an option but unfortunately it is an option here in the Kimberley and we know that, you know, because we've experienced and felt that."

If you or anyone you know needs help:

Ms Skeen shared her insights on youth suicide with the Prime Minister in Broome late on Thursday after recently giving evidence to the coronial inquest.
One child protection worker told the inquest last month .
"I gave [Mr Turnbull] a few messages but one of the messages is, it's not around preventing suicide," the youth development officer said.
"It's when there's investment into basic human rights, such as health, education, culture, training and employment, that is what prevents suicide."
Mr Turnbull said Ms Skeen's words were moving.
"We are absolutely committed to working with you, my commitment as Prime Minister, the commitment of my Government is to do things with Aboriginal people, not do things to them, which of course is part of the problem, the problems of the past that you again so movingly described," he said.
Ms Skeen spoke of the need for young people to have Mabu Liyan, a Yawuru phrase meaning good feeling or wellbeing.
The Prime Minister said he would be thinking about it.
"You said it's hard to translate into English - there's a great definition of poetry and probably the best definition of poetry is that which cannot be translated," he said.
Mr Turnbull said he did not accept the proposition the Kimberley's suicide problems could not be helped.
"We never accept young people taking their own lives, like we never accept the abuse of women and children," he said.
"We never accept substance abuse destroying families and communities and we'll always be working to protect families, to help communities rebuild."
The inquest is due to continue in Fitzroy Crossing on Friday.
