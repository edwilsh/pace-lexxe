  <title>Victoria Police celebrates 100 years of women in police</title>
  <content>
A CENTURY ago last Friday, Madge Connor and Elizabeth Beers became the first two female members of Victoria Police.
Police across the state marked the anniversary with a series of events celebrating policewomen.
Darebin Inspector Kelly Lawson said roughly 35 per cent of officers in the region were female.
"It's a fantastic career for women - it offers flexible work options for family needs and there are a wide variety of areas you can work in," she said.
Insp Lawson, who has spent almost three decades on the force, said attitudes had changed dramatically. "(When I started) there were barriers for women that are no longer there," she said.
Victoria Police continues a recruitment drive for almost 3000 new members, with a focus on female recruits.
