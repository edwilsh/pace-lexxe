  <title>SA World War II veteran turns 100</title>
  <content>
A South Australian World War II veteran, who was one of the famed Rats of Tobruk, has turned 100 and is being honoured at a ceremony at Government House.
Bill Corey was 22 when he enlisted in 1940 and for the next five years fought in in El Alamein, New Guinea and Borneo as well as joining the famous siege of Tobruk in 1941.
"I am just Bill, but I do serve a purpose, seems as though I have been kept alive all this time to be a bridge for history in time," Mr Corey said in a statement on Monday.
