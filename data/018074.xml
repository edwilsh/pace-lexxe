A motorcyclist suffered serious injuries after crashing into a race track wall at 200 kilometres per hour in Sydney's west.
CareFlight's rescue helicopter was tasked to Eastern Creek Railway following reports the rider, in his 30s, had struck a wall at high speed.
The man, initially unconscious, was treated at the scene by track paramedics before the helicopter arrived.
Specialist doctors and critical care paramedics provided further treatment at the scene for serious head, shoulder and back injuries.
He was transferred to Westmead Hospital in a stable condition.
