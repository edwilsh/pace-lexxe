  <title>Powerful smoke gustnado forms during California bushfire</title>
  <content>
A large bushfire has triggered a spectacular smoke "gustnado" in north-western Los Angeles.
Video shared by  showed the plumes of smoke from a spot fire swirling in an upwards direction, and into a large vortex shape on Friday afternoon (local time).
It then appeared to dissipate slightly, as a firefighting helicopter drops water on the blaze causing the gustnado.
The dramatic weather event is not considered to be a tornado, but a "short-lived, ground-based swirling wind", according to AccuWeather.
In the time since the gustnado was captured on camera, the small fire that triggered it has grown into a 25-acre bushfire in the Gorman region, a Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman told Fox LA.
The fire is not threatening properties, the spokesman added.
