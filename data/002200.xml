  <title>Nat MP Hodgkinson to quit NSW parliament</title>
  <content>
The NSW government will face another mid-term by-election test with Katrina Hodgkinson to quit parliament at the end of August.
The Cootamundra MP on Monday said she was resigning after almost 20 years in parliament and it was time to move on to something new.
"The decision is not one based on any single electorate issue, simply it is a 'length of service' decision," Ms Hodgkinson said in a statement.
The Nationals MP said she planned to spend more time with her family and "engage in opportunities that may arise within the corporate sector".
She will officially retire on August 31, her spokesman told AAP.
It's understood Ms Hodgkinson's decision has taken her party by surprise.
It was widely expected she would run again in her safe seat at the March 2019 election.
