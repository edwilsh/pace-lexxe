  <title>Marquez edges out Rossi to take pole in Brno</title>
  <content>
Marc Marquez took his fourth pole position of the 2017 MotoGP season after edging Valentino Rossi by less than a tenth of a second in Czech Grand Prix qualifying at Brno.
Much of the second qualifying session was led by Dani Pedrosa, who set an early benchmark of 1m55.313s that stood until the final two minutes of running.
On his first run, Marquez slotted into second, 0.026s behind his Honda teammate, but he managed to eclipse Pedrosa's time by more than three tenths on his second run, as he set a 1m54.981s to end up on top.
