Television personality-turned-euthanasia advocate Andrew Denton has been forced to pull out of the campaign to legalise assisted dying in Victoria because he has been diagnosed with advanced heart disease.
The 57-year-old must now have a triple bypass within days, just as the Andrews Government prepares to introduce a historic bill to Parliament.
Denton is one of the directors of Go Gentle Australia, which he established last year to lobby for voluntary euthanasia around the country.

"Euthanasia and assisted suicide represent the abandonment of those who are in greatest need of our care and support," they wrote.
Mr Andrews said he expected "robust debate" about the legislation, but he hoped it would be respectful.
"My own conscience tells me that this is the change that needs to be made," he said.
