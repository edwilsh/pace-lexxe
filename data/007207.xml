  <title>Hooper to be unveiled as Wallabies skipper</title>
  <content>
MICHAEL Hooper is expected to be unveiled as the new Wallabies captain on Wednesday.
The Wallabies will hold an afternoon media conference when it's anticipated Hooper's appointment will be confirmed.
He will take over the captaincy from veteran hooker Stephen Moore who announced last week he would retire from Test rugby at the end of the season.
Hooper, who has already captained the side, is tipped to lead the Wallabies immediately with Australia facing the All Blacks in their Rugby Championship opener in Sydney on August 19.
The pressure will be straight on Hooper who many believe shouldn't be an automatic selection at No.7 when champion flanker David Pocock returns from a 12-month rugby sabbatical next year.
The 25-year-old Hooper has endured a difficult Super Rugby season with the under-performing Waratahs and his leadership of the side and form has come under question.
Pocock, 29, has captained the Wallabies and could emerge as a candidate to lead the side if Australia struggle in the Rugby Championship ahead of the 2019 World Cup.
