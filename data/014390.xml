  <title>Everybody Panic (Or Not): Twitter Is Down</title>
  <content>

Twitter is down. But don't panic, here's a handy guide for other things you can do instead.

Literally anything else.

We've contacted Twitter to see what's going on.

We'll keep you updated as to when it's working again, so you can jump on Twitter and tweet about Twitter having gone down.

You're welcome.

This article was originally posted on February 8, then May 19 - the last times Twitter was down. I'll probably just re-use it next time, too (with relevant updates, of course) so feel free to comment if you need a hug at this trying time.
