Newcastle trainer Kris Lees has won the race to add Prized Icon to his stables but he will not see the 2016 Victorian Derby champion until the end of the year.
The four-year-old stallion was one of the most sought-after horses left without a trainer after James Cummings' rise to Godolphin's top job in Australia.
Lees was a contender to take on the winner of $1,774,100 in prizemoney after already gaining other talents from Gooree Stud, including Whispering Secret and Launch Code, and it was confirmed on Monday that Prized Icon was headed to Newcastle.

Prized Icon's last start was an 11th in the group 3 Grand Prix Stakes at Eagles Farm on May 27 after which he had to recover from a virus.

He will not return for the spring and instead be kept for an autumn campaign under Lees.
"We won't see him until the end of the year, he's having a long spell," Lees said.
"He'll be starting from scratch, so we'll see how he goes."

Lees, meanwhile, was weighing up options for Invincible Gem after her group 2 Missile Stakes (1200 metres) win on Saturday at Randwick.
The four-year-old mare was set to next race in the group 3 Sheraco Stakes (1100m) at Rosehill on September 9 but the weight penalty for Saturday's victory could prompt a change.
"It just depends what weight she gets in her next race," Lees said. 

"But we've got a few options for her. It depends on the depth of the race, and she might be topweight, so I might not run her yet."
