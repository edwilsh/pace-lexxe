  <title>Roxon joins Dexus board</title>
  <content>
FORMER federal health minister Nicola Roxon is set to join the board of Dexus Funds Management as the property group pushes into the healthcare space.
The appointment comes after Dexus recently set up a joint venture with developer Commercial & General for a wholesale unlisted healthcare fund, eyeing favourable demographics.
The Australian Healthcare Property Fund will begin with about $370 million of healthcare assets and could increase to a value of about $800 million through further acquisitions.
Ms Roxon's appointment is effective from September 1 and she will stand for election at Dexus's annual general meeting in October.
