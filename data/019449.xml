THE Veronicas have revealed their mother, Colleen, is being treated in hospital for a mystery illness.
Usually based in the US, twin sisters Jess and Lisa Origliasso are back home spending time with Colleen in Brisbane.
Taking to social media yesterday, Jess shared a snap of her actor partner Ruby Rose perched on her mum's hospital bed.
"Loves of my life," Jess wrote. "Ruby in a butterfly headband, gifting carebear slippers to my pixie mama in matching flannel is my favourite thing about today."

The Veronicas would not comment when contacted yesterday, but their mother has been battling her illness for some time.
In November last year, Rose flew Colleen first class to New Zealand for a surprise visit when The Veronicas were shooting the clip for On Your Side.
"Our mum's been sick and she's always been an amazing support system in our life and our family's life," Jess said last year.

Lisa captioned this photo "it will always be the three of us forever and ever." Picture: Instagram @lisa_veronicaSource:Instagram
In January, for their mum's birthday, Lisa shared a heartfelt tribute to "my beautiful earth angel" on Instagram.
"We owe the biggest part of the women we are today, to you. So many of the experiences and adventures we've been on and shared together is because of you. The people and opportunities you have introduced us to. You have made our world a far more colourful, extraordinary, fun, crazy, loving and cool place to be. Without you, there is no us ... it will always be the three of us forever and ever."
