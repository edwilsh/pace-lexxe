  <title>A sequel to Super Size Me will go after fast-food chicken  --  here's how McDonald's nuggets are made</title>
  <content>
Morgan Spurlock, the filmmaker behind Super Size Me, is going after the fast-food industry again in a sequel to his hit 2004 documentary that skewered McDonald's.
This time, he's focusing on the chicken industry.

The sequel, called Super Size Me 2: Holy Chicken!, is focused on how major fast-food chains develop, cook, and market chicken products. It will debut at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, .

We don't know yet what restaurants are going to be featured in the film, but given the filmmaker's history of hammering McDonald's, it's probably a safe bet that he'll pick on the Golden Arches again.

McDonald's has made an effort recently to be transparent about its food processes.

Here's how the chain's chicken nuggets are made, according to
by McDonald's Canada.
