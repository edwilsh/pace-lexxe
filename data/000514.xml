  <title>SA wants Murray Darling judicial inquiry</title>
  <content>
A who's-who of South Australian state and federal politicians are calling for an independent judicial inquiry into water use in the Murray Darling Basin.
The state government and a group of federal senators including Penny Wong, Nick Xenophon, Cory Bernardi and Sarah Hanson Young have called on the prime minister to commission the inquiry.
The demand comes as the Turnbull government announced an independent review by the Murray Darling Basin Authority into water usage following allegations aired by the ABC-TV's Four Corners that billions of litres of water earmarked for the environment had been diverted for cotton irrigation in NSW.
