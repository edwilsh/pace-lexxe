  <title>Parents capture heart-warming moment they surprise daughters with adopted sister</title>
  <content>
Two parents have captured the moment their daughters broke down in tears as they surprised them with a newly adopted sister.
Shane Pruitt, 38, and his wife, Kasi Pruitt, 32, had been working to adopt a child for more than a year when they learned on July 25 that a newborn girl would be theirs,
The Pruitts, who live in Texas, didn't want to tell their children, Raygen and Harper, in case something fell through last minute, so instead they opted to surprise them.
"Our kids had no clue," Mr Pruitt said in a Twitter post.
"So this is how we told them about their baby sister," he wrote.
The video shows Ms Pruitt walking into the kitchen, as Raygen and Harper look at their mother stunned.
When they finally clue in it is their new one-month-old baby sister, Harper can be heard screaming "Are you kidding me", before they both break down in tears.

Mr Pruitt said the family is feeling "humbled and excited" about the process and hopes this video sheds light on adoption.
"If it shines a lot on adoption and encourages other families to step up and be foster parents or adopt, then that's the ultimate win."
