  <title>Brisbane 'Australia's sexiest city' as Sexpo records tumble</title>
  <content>
It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but the numbers don't lie, Brisbane Sexpo 2017 has gone off with a bang, beating previous local and national records over the weekend.

Sexpo event director Bentleigh Gibson said the event had been visiting Brisbane since 2001 and the 15th show had attracted record interest.
"Even at the end of day two (Saturday), it's truly been a record-breaking show, with SEXPO selling out of our top tier Platinum tickets prior to the show even opening," he said.Photo: Matt Bartolo Photography (Supplied)
"We've not only beaten previous Platinum ticket sales by 30 per cent, we've also exceeded expectations for our Lounge Tickets, with sales beating shows in all other cities nationally.
"For our retailers, we have seen the best performing Friday night of sales in the past five SEXPO shows held in Perth, Melbourne and Sydney.

"Attendee numbers have exceeded our expectations, with higher numbers than the last three shows in Brisbane and almost 20,000 free Virtual Reality headsets being provided to patrons as part of our sex and tech-themed event."

The exhibition does not annually arrive in Brisbane, with the last show being held in 2015 and the next one scheduled for 2019, which Mr Gibson believed had contributed to the record numbers.Photo: Matt Bartolo Photography (Supplied)
"We haven't been to the Sunshine State in two years, so I think there is genuine curiosity about what's out and about in the industry now," he said.

Sexpo started in Melbourne during 1996, with the first show held in the foyer of the Carlton Crest Hotel. Today, it occupies major exhibition centres across the world.
"It began primarily as a way to bring adult products and toys out of shops, and into a mainstream, comfortable, secure environment," Mr Gibson said.Photo: Matt Bartolo Photography (Supplied)
"Prior to this, adult products had mostly been confined to toy shops in unsavoury areas of cities."
The event has evolved during its 21-year history, with a lot more focus placed on sexual health and lifestyle, as opposed to the show being all about the products.
"It has evolved into areas of health, sexuality and lifestyle - with the introduction of main stages, health seminars, amusement rides and special interest lounges," Mr Gibson said.
This year's event included a range of key attractions, adult stars, special guests, retailers and performances.
"We have over 40 live stage shows, 25 health and wellness seminars, 150 retailers, 4 special interest lounges, a space-theme carnival ride, drones and a motocross stunt team," Mr Gibson said.
"We also have free virtual reality headsets which feature gaming and adult content, there's also drones, as well as mini exhibitions such as Body Beautiful, and RAW which focuses on women's self-esteem and empowerment."
Also on show was penile artist Pricasso, using his penis to draw portraits, along with interactive gaming demonstrations, cosplay competitions, workshops and meet-and-greets.
Sexpo Brisbane runs until 8pm on Sunday, with more information and tickets available via the .
