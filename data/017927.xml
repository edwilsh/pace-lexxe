  <content>
A man has fallen from a moving taxi, after jumping onto the car bonnet and climbing onto the roof in north Queensland on Friday night.
Police said a 36-year-old man ran out in front of a taxi along Waterson Way in Cannonvale, near Airlie Beach, before climbing on top of the car and starting to damage it.Photo: Supplied
The taxi began moving again, causing the man to fall off. 
The taxi driver continued driving towards the local police station after the man fell, with police later finding the victim on the road with serious head injuries.
Officers administered first aid before the victim was taken to Proserpine Hospital, and later transferred to Townsville Hospital, where he remains in a critical but stable condition.
The Forensic Crash Unit was investigating.
