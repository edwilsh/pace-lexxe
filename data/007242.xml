  <title>More power more Mercedes-AMG GT models...what's not to like?</title>
  <content>
THREE new models will join a more powerful Mercedes-AMG GT range in October.
The AMG GT Coupe gains 10kW (to 350kW) and 30Nm to (630Nm), while the AMG GT S Coupe receives an extra 9kW (to 384kW) and 20Nm (to 670Nm) respectively.
Like all models in the range, they will also be fitted with the Panamericana grille along with styling enhancements to the front apron and intakes.
The pair is joined in Australia by the range-topping AMG GT R Coupe, the 430kW/700Nm monster which set the Mount Panorama racetrack alight in February this year with a new production car record of 2 minutes 16.5 seconds during a demonstration session at the LiquiMoly Bathurst 12-Hour Race.
The coupe range expands to include a special edition of the new AMG GT C Coupe as well as two open-top roadsters, effectively doubling the choices available to intending Mercedes-AMG GT customers.
Perfectly timed ahead of the warmer months, the AMG GT Roadster and AMG GT C Roadster have a triple layer fabric roof stored in a Z-fold arrangement behind the seats when open. The roof opens and closes in 11 seconds up to a speed of 50km/h.
Like the AMG GT Coupe, the AMG GT Roadster utilises a powerful V8 front mid-engine design harnessing 350kW of power and 630Nm of torque.
Other equipment designed to maximise open-top enjoyment includes a 'draught stop' wind deflector and heated seats, while a 10-speaker Burmester surround sound system and Comand Online multimedia system with a 21.3cm high resolution colour display.
The AMG GT C Roadster not only delivers more output and torque (410kW and 680Nm), it also impresses with numerous technical highlights from the AMG GT R Coupe for even more dynamic performance. Like the AMG GT R, the AMG GT C Roadster is recognisable by its wide, muscular rear end and large wheels.
Positioned between the AMG GT S and AMG GT R Coupe models, the AMG GT C Roadster incorporates standard features including performance seats in nappa leather, an AMG Performance steering wheel in black nappa leather and Dinamica, heated and ventilated seats, and Airscarf neck level heating.
To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of Aufrecht, Melcher and Grossaspach - the high-performance arm of Mercedes-Benz better known as Mercedes-AMG - a special 'Edition 50' version of the newly arrived AMG GT C Coupe has been created.
Powered by the same 410kW/680Nm front-mounted V8 as the AMG GT C Roadster, the AMG GT C Coupe will be available exclusively in 'Edition 50' specification until 2018.
Highlights of the AMG GT C Edition 50 Coupe include AMG Performance seats and steering wheel, the AMG interior Night Package, Edition 50 detailing in the head restraints and steering wheel bezel, quilted nappa leather upholstery, AMG trim elements in black chrome, LED high performance headlamps, black chrome exterior highlights, 19/20-inch AMG cross-spoke forged wheels and a choice of two 'designo' paint colours - graphite grey magno or cashmere white magno.
