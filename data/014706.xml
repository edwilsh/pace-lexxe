Online travel agency Webjet has raised about $93 million from the institutional stage of its capital raising.
The company says there has been a 98 per cent take-up rate for the first phase of its entitlement offer, at $10 per new share, with the retail element set to open on August 10.
Webjet, which will resume trading on Friday after a two-day trading halt, plans to raise about $164 million in total to support its acquisition of European travel business JacTravel Group.
