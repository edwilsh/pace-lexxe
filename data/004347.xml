Acting mayor Paul Tully and Division 7 councillor Andrew Antoniolli, both Labor Party members, are running as independents, unendorsed by the party.
The only endorsed party candidate in the poll is Brett Morrissey, who is running under the Greens' banner.

Peter Luxton and Gary Duffy, who were Mr Pisasale's only two opponents in the 2016 Ipswich City Council election, will both appear on the ballot.
