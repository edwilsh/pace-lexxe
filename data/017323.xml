  <title>STOCKS EDGE HIGHER: Here's what you need to know</title>
  <content>
US stocks edged higher, back towards record levels, as investors digested Friday's montly jobs data release and the latest round of corporate earnings reports.

The S&P 500 added 0.1%, while the Dow climbed 0.2% to a record-high close and the Nasdaq rose less than 0.1%. Government data released Friday morning showed employers steadily added workers in July, while wage growth increased.

First up, the scoreboard:

Dow: 22,077.91, +51.70, (+0.23%)

S&P 500: 2,475.82, +3.84, (+0.16%)

Nasdaq: 6,348.90, +8.51, (+0.13%)

US 10-year yield: 2.27%, +0.039

WTI crude oil: $US49.51, +0.48, +0.98%

1. . US employers added 209,000 jobs on net, while the unemployment rate returned to a 16-year low of 4.3%, according to the Labour Department's report.

2. . It was a rare day of strength for the greenback, which, through Thursday, had fallen nearly 8% since inauguration day, as President Donald Trump's economic agenda has stalled.

3. . That's because the fate of tech stocks - and, by extension, the investment funds that hold them in abundance - is getting increasingly tied to macro factors.

4. . About 58% of large-cap fund managers beat their benchmark in July, marking the fifth straight month in which a majority of them outperformed. That's the longest such streak on record.

5 . . Investors are requiring a higher premium to hold the bills that mature during the weeks in mid-October when the debt ceiling could be breached.
