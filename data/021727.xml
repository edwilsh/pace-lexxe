"Being a local Londoner, she's made no secret about how personally affected she was by the Grenfell Tower blaze and wants to help in every way she can," a source told the newspaper. 
"While she's working hard behind the scenes to raise cash, she wanted to treat residents to a night of fun and help take their minds off what happened and organised a private viewing of the brand new Despicable Me 3 movie."

At least 80 people died when a fire broke out in the 24-storey West London building.
Firefighters originally warned occupants to remain in their apartments, but improper cladding caused the fourth floor fire to accelerate alarmingly. A final death toll is not expected to be released until at least 2018, but around 255 people are said to have survived.Photo: AP
Adele previously implored her fans to donate to her Grenfell Tower fund while performing at Wembley Stadium back in June.
