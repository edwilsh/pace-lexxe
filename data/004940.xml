  <title>Sydney Kings embrace NBA challenge as they prepare for Joe Inges and Utah Jazz</title>
  <content>
If the reaction of veteran guard Brad Newley is any indication, the Sydney Kings will make a good fist of their clash with NBA club Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City on October 3 [AEST].
The Kings were one of three NBL clubs to win the right to face NBA sides ahead of the new season with Melbourne United to play Oklahoma City Thunder in OKC on October 9 and Brisbane Bullets to play Phoenix Suns in Phoenix on October 14.

Dellavedova: Big goals for Bucks next year

Matthew Dellavedova is in Melbourne during the NBA off-season where he discusses the form of his young team, his own form, and where he sees the Bucks headed.AAP

Newley has played in Europe and represented Australia at multiple Olympics and world championships but Kings coach Andrew Gaze said he was stunned by his star player's  excitement  when  told  of the game.
"When Brad Newley found out about this yesterday he was like a 12-year old-running around," Gaze said on Tuesday.

"He is so much looking forward to it, it was great to see the reaction from someone like Brad who is such an experienced campaigner and has been to Olympic Games.
"To see how excited he was about this opportunity, it makes you feel like we have the right guys who are in this for the right reasons - they love the game and the competition and they want to aspire to play at the highest level."

The game will pit the Kings against one of the NBA's elite defences led by 223-centimetre centre Ruby Gobert and including  Australians Joe Ingles and Dante Exum.
But it will also be a chance for Kings such as Kevin Lisch, Jason Cadee, Todd Blanchfield and 19-year-old rookie centre Isaac Humphries to make their case for future NBA tryouts.Photo: RICK BOWMER
Ingles took plenty of trash talk from Gaze and other Australian stars at the NBL's announcement but he said his countrymen would face a Jazz side determined to win.
"It won't be taken lightly, if anyone knows our coach it definitely won't be taken lightly," Ingles said.
"So it will be a great experience for those guys that are playing, for the NBL, obviously being a part of it, but also for the fans and for the kids."
Ingles said that  Salt Lake City's high altitude and playing under NBA rules - including the longer three-point line - would trouble the Kings.
Ingles is known throughout the NBA as a player who engages in trash talk and he admits the banter between him and the Kings would go to "another level".
"I'll definitely be talking to Drewy [Gaze] on the sidelines," a smiling Ingles said.
"Between him and [Jazz coach] Quin Snyder, he beat Quin in the Final Four in 1921 or whatever it was, so there's a bit of history there. Me and Brad Newley went to school together too."
Gaze was an assistant coach with the Indiana Pacers at the recent NBA Summer League and he was told the Jazz had one of the most original game styles in the NBA so he can't wait to be tested out.
He also remembers his Seton Hall Pirates side beating Snyder's Duke Blue Devils in the NCAA Final Four in 1989. When asked if he feared Snyder might remember that defeat and tell his side to beat the Kings by a big margin, Gaze laughed,  "I hope not. "But I will be looking down that other end as well and say 'hey. we want to keep this winning streak going'."
