Other military aircraft and ships have been sent to the area, where they are combing the water for any sign of the missing service members.
In a statement, the US Marine Corps Public Affairs Office said there had been a "mishap".
"The United States Marine Corps confirms there is an active search and rescue mission ongoing for service members involved in an MV-22 mishap off the east coast of Australia," the statement said.
"Ships, small boats and aircraft from the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit and Bonhomme Richard Expeditionary Strike Group are conducting the search and rescue operations.

"We will provide more details as they become available."
The US MV-22s were in Australia for Talisman Saber, a joint military exercise involving 33,000 US and Australian troops which is held each two years.
