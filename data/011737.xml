The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) has been accused of failing to comply with anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing laws.

It accuses the lender of over 53,700 contraventions of law, with the contravention carries a maximum penalty of $18 million.
Among AUSTRAC's allegations are claims CBA failed to assess the money laundering and terrorism financing risk of intelligent deposit machines.
It is also alleged the bank failed to meet its requirements related to monitoring transactions.
