  <title>'Shifting gear': Rio Tinto posts $4.14 billion profit</title>
  <content>
Mining giant Rio Tinto has delivered net earnings of $US3.3 billion ($A4.14 billion) and pledged to return $US3 billion to shareholders.

The mining giant, which produces more iron ore than any other Australian miner, has about 200,000 Australian shareholders.
Other highlights from the results included underlying profit of $US9.04 billion before tax, depreciation and amortisation and a fall in Rio's net debt to $US7.6 billion.

"Today we have announced total cash returns to shareholders of $3 billion. By driving performance, focusing on cash and allocating it with discipline we are delivering superior cash returns to our shareholders," Rio Tinto chief executive J-S Jacques said.
"These are strong results: operating cash flow was $6.3 billion and we met our $2 billion cash cost reduction target six months early. We are now shifting gear to focus on the untapped value from our productivity programme and continue to strengthen our portfolio to build higher returns for the future. We announced the sale of our thermal coal business in Australia for $2.7 billion and are making good progress on our compelling growth projects - Oyu Tolgoi, Amrun and Silvergrass."

The release of Rio's half-year results coincides with a recent surge in the iron ore price, which this week rose to its highest level in four months, above $US70 a tonne. On Tuesday night it closed down US14cents to $US73.56 per tonne, delivered to the Chinese port of Qingdao.
Last week Goldman Sachs raised its three-month iron ore forecast to $US70 a tonne, up from $US55 a tonne.
The dividend will be payable on Thursday, September 21.
