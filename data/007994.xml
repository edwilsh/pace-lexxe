  <title>Alanis Morissette to tour Australia</title>
  <content>
The 90s resurgence is in full force with the news that Alanis Morissette will tour Sydney and Melbourne for the first time since 1999.
The Ironic singer will play just two dates in January, one in Melbourne followed by another in Sydney.
Morissette has five albums to draw on, but arguably her most famous was 1995's hit Jagged Little Pill, which won five Grammys and sold more than 33 million copies.
The Canadian singer's other albums included Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie (1998), Under Rug Swept (2002), So-Called Chaos (2004), Flavours Of Entanglement (2008) and her most recent release Havoc And Bright Lights from 2012.
She also sang on the soundtrack to The Chronicles of Narnia, Prince of Persia and City of Angels.
In 2016, Morissette started a monthly podcast, Conversation with Alanis Morissette, covering topics such as psychology, art and well-being.
She is currently working on new music and writing a book, and will tour the US before her shows in Australia.
* An Evening With Alanis Morrissette tour dates:
January 23 - Palais Theatre, Melbourne
January 24 - ICC Sydney Theatre, Sydney
