  <title>'There's a bullet in my steak': Woman's Woolies meat claim</title>
  <content>
AN Australian woman claims she's found a bullet fragment in her kangaroo steak, which she purchased from supermarket giant Woolworths.

Taking to Facebook, Kath Milroy Pattingale posted a photo of the steak - which clearly shows the golden shell sitting in the centre of the meat.

"Mmmmmm thanks Woolies - nothing more appetising than a bullet in my kangaroo!," her post read, which has been liked more than 25,000 times.

"This pic was taken on a chopping board when we were cutting up the meat (a 60mm thick fillet) after taking if off the barbie - it didn't make it to the dinner plate!"

Ms Pattingale claims she left the meat in the fridge for a Woolworths representative to look at.

Her post was met with 12,000 comments, with some social media users claiming it could be a stitch up.

"Looks like a con to me," one person posted.

"Certainly Woolworths would run their meats through a metal detector before sending it off," another wrote.

A Woolworths Australia spokesperson told news.com.au in a statement that they "take all customer concerns seriously and are investigating the issue raised".

The post has since been deleted 

News.com.au has contacted Ms Pattingale for comment.
