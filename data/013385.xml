  <title>Mitchell Moses orchestrates Parramatta's sixth straight win against hapless Bulldogs</title>
  <content>
It's been 10 years since Parramatta won as many games as they have this season, continuing their charge to the top four by compounding Canterbury's woes with a 20-4 victory on Thursday night.

The Eels halfback orchestrated his side's 13th win of the season on a wet and miserable night at ANZ Stadium, adding further damage to the car wreck that is Canterbury's 2017 season.
With win No.6 on the trot, a top-four finish for the Eels for the first time since 2005 now looks on the cards as they continue to gather momentum with Moses and Corey Norman calling the shots.

The kicking game of the Eels playmakers strangled the Bulldogs out of the contest, forcing more repeat sets (nine) than the Bulldogs scored points on another night to forget for Des Hasler's men.
But it was Moses who again took centre stage, answering calls from coach Brad Arthur to make this Eels outfit his own.

Des Hasler decided to tinker with the formation, dropping Matt Frawley to reserve grade to give Chase Stanley his shot at the five-eighth role.

But unfortunately for Hasler, the Stanley experiment was far from the stroke of genius he was hoping it would be, with a disjointed attack looking even worse with the former Dragons and Storm back in the halves.
There was a moment in the second half that threatened to dominate the news cycle for the rest of the week when the referee said to Eels backrower Frank Pritchard "He bit your face? Do you want to make an allegation?"
It was in reference to a collision with Bulldogs prop David Klemmer, but Pritchard didn't want to take things further with replays showing very little to suggest foul play from Klemmer.
â€‹Hasler would have been fuming over the fashion in which his side conceded first points of the game, with Eels prop Daniel Alvaro humiliating James Graham and Aiden Tolman when he carried the pair over the line to give his side an early 6-0 lead.
The embarrassment continued for the Bulldogs soon after, with Josh Morris coughing up possession unopposed, dropping the pill from a tap restart with the defensive line still 10 metres away.
Canterbury, as they have been throughout a disastrous 2017 campaign, were their own worst enemy once again. Penalties and a lack of respect for the ball saw the Eels dominate possession in the opening exchanges, with the Bulldogs waiting 24 minutes before finally making inroads inside the Parramatta 20 metre zone.
Moses continued his impressive run of form when he sliced open the Bulldogs defence, stepping past Chase Stanley to set up Bevan French with his sixth consecutive try in as many appearances.
Canterbury finally saw quality ball in the dying stages of the first half, but in the wet conditions and a stuttering attack, they failed to trouble a rock-solid Parramatta defence that looks ready to withstand the rigours of finals football.
A penalty goal saw the Eels extend their lead to 18-0 in the second half, but the Bulldogs managed to hit back through Marcelo Montoya after a runaway Brenko Lee put his winger over for his eight try in his debut season.
