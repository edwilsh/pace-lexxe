THERE'S brutal, then there's this.
Former Richmond and Western Bulldogs star Nathan Brown went through every AFL club and picked a modern-day player he would sledge, if given the chance.
Brown certainly didn't hold back on his Triple M radio segment, with his sledges ranging from the hilarious, to the harsh, to the downright inappropriate.
Here are a taste of his sledges.

ADELAIDE
"I'm going to go for David Mackay," Brown said on Triple M.
"And I'd be going up to him going 'you're the only man that could spend a decade on a list and still look like an under-18 boy!'"
CARLTON
"Dale Thomas - the only man that's paid $47,000 a possession."
COLLINGWOOD
"I had a look through the list and there was a few on offer at Collingwood but I found Chris Mayne ... (I'd say) 'With a head like that, I'd take tails.'"
FREMANTLE
"I'd go to Stephen Hill and remind him that 'you're not even the best player in your family.'"
GEELONG
"For the Cats, I'd go (Mark) Blicavs - 'You must have been pretty bad at athletics if you thought this was your go.'"
GOLD COAST SUNS
"There's only one man you'd go there - Gary Ablett. I'd walk up to Gary Ablett and say '(there's) talk about you heading back to Geelong, I hear your teammates are buying you the airfare!'"
GWS GIANTS
"Toby Greene at GWS - 'I hear they do a great parma at Zagame's.'"
MELBOURNE
"Clayton Oliver at the Demons - 'Did he sneeze into a Milo tin this morning?'"
PORT ADELAIDE
"Old Tommy Jonas has been complaining that commentators don't get his name right, that's because we don't give a s***"
WEST COAST EAGLES
"I'd be just rolling up to Sam Butler - I'd have said 'you're the only premiership Eagle and no b*****d's ever heard of you.'"
WESTERN BULLDOGS
"I'd be reminding Bob Murphy 'no matter how many times you watch that vision of yourself on the dais - you didn't win a premiership.'"
