  <title>Former Dog's brutal Bob sledge</title>
  <content>
FORMER Bulldogs and Richmond star Nathan Brown has revealed the sledge he would use on a player from every team, and has saved his most cutting words for a fan favourite.
Brown, who admitted that during his playing days "I was very, very happy with myself" was given the task by his Triple M colleagues of nominating a player from every club to target, and what material he would use to put them off their game.
SCROLL DOWN TO SEE ALL 18 NATHAN BROWN SLEDGES
Players' looks and run-ins with police weren't spared, but the sledge he would use on Bob Murphy cuts right to the bone.
THE TACKLE:
BONT COLUMN:
"I'd be reminding Bob Murphy no matter how many times you watch that vision of yourself on the dais, you didn't win a premiership," Brown said.
Murphy was invited on to the podium after last year's Grand Final to help lift the cup after the Bulldogs' drought-breaking flag.
The club captain didn't play after suffering a season-ending knee injury in Round 3, but coach Luke Beveridge draped his premiership medal around Murphy's neck in one of the most moving moments of the season.
"That's Bambi you've gone after," host James Brayshaw told Brown. "You are the only person in Melbourne who can utter that sentence."
WHO WOULD NATHAN BROWN SLEDGE AT YOUR CLUB?
ADELAIDE: DAVID MACKAY

"You're the only man that could spend a decade on a list and still look like an under-18 boy."
BRISBANE: ALLEN CHRISTENSEN

"I'd wander over to Allen Christensen and question why he was driven out of Geelong."
CARLTON: DALE THOMAS

"The only man that's paid $47,000 a possession."
COLLINGWOOD: CHRIS MAYNE

"With a head like that, I'd take tails."
ESSENDON: TOM BELLCHAMBERS

"I'd be talking to Bellcho about his injuries, so much footy, you're exhausted after all your after-hours work."
FREMANTLE: STEPHEN HILL

"You're not even the best player in your family."
GEELONG: MARK BLICAVS

"You must have been pretty bad at athletics if you thought this was your go."
GOLD COAST: GARY ABLETT

"Talk about you heading back to Geelong, I hear your teammates are buying you the airfare."
GWS: TOBY GREENE

"I hear they do a great parma at Zagame's."
HAWTHORN: TY VICKERY

"I'd question whether Jake King was trying to extort money out of Hawthorn to get it back."
MELBOURNE: CLAYTON OLIVER

"Did he sneeze into a Milo tin this morning?"
NORTH MELBOURNE: RYAN CLARKE

"NASA's come calling, they're looking for a new place to land a rocket and your forehead looks great."
PORT ADELAIDE: TOM JONAS

"Tommy Jonas has been complaining that commentators don't get his name right, that's because we don't give a sh--."
RICHMOND: ALEX RANCE

"He met his girlfriend at 16 and he's been with her the whole time, I'd say you've wasted your talents all these years."
ST KILDA: DAVID ARMITAGE

"I'd heard that Armitage isn't the smartest man out there, so I'd be making sure there's a concussion test performed before every game."
SYDNEY: CALLUM SINCLAIR

"I'd be asking if they put your head in a vice when you were a youngster, for a big man you have the smallest pill in the world."
WEST COAST: SAM BUTLER

"You're the only premiership Eagle (still playing) and no bastard's ever heard of you."
WESTERN BULLDOGS: ROBERT MURPHY

"I'd be reminding Bob Murphy no matter how many times you watch that vision of yourself on the dais, you didn't win a premiership."
