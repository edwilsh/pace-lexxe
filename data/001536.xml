  <title>Woman who killed grandfather Robert Whitwell has 'psychological issues', lawyer says</title>
  <content>
A woman who murdered her grandfather after learning he kept his life savings at his northern Adelaide home has "significant psychological issues", her lawyer has told the Supreme Court.
Brittney Jade Dwyer, 20, confessed to killing her 81-year-old grandfather Robert Whitwell in his Craigmore home in August 2016.
The court heard Dwyer travelled to Adelaide from her home in Redbank Plains, south-west of Brisbane, to steal money from her grandfather after learning he kept his life savings in a shed in his backyard.
Her friend Bernadette Burns, 22, was also charged with murder and pleaded not guilty. She will go on trial in Adelaide's Supreme Court next week.
In the lead-up to Dwyer's sentencing, prosecutor Jim Pearce QC today told the court Burns premeditated and pre-planned the attack on her 'Pop'.
"She went into that house wearing rubber gloves. She took a knife into the house," he said.
"She had told people up in Brisbane before she set off on this trip that she was intending to kill her Pop, that he might have to die."
The court heard the elderly man lived alone and kept "hundreds of thousands" of dollars in life savings in his shed.
Dwyer's lawyer Craig Caldicott said his client did not dispute the prosecutor's explanation of her intentions.
"She went down there to rob him. She accepts that. She's given that in her record of interview," he said.

"She says that she wore the gloves. She took the knife in with her ... and then on her version  ... washes the dishes."
Mr Caldicott said his client has been a "very troubled young woman over a long period of time" who had difficulties with drugs and alcohol.
"She clearly has significant psychological issues," he said.
The court heard Dwyer had made an 11th-hour claim to the psychiatrist tasked with preparing a report about another potential motive for the killing, to which there was no evidence to support.
"There is not one word uttered to police in any record of interview or any statement provided about her grandfather doing [anything] of the sort," Mr Pearce said.
"It is just simply an invention designed to give her an explanation for why she acted as she did because the only other possible explanation is premeditated, pre-planned almost sociopathic killing."
Dwyer will be sentenced at a later date.
She sat in the dock with her friend Shelby Lee Angie Holmes, 19, who was charged over going to Mr Whitwell's home with the intention of stealing money in the months before the murder.
Holmes and Dwyer's failed attempt to steal money

The court heard Holmes and Dwyer packed a bag with a knife, gloves and cable ties and drove from Queensland to Adelaide a few months before the murder.

It heard on the night of the offending they snuck into Mr Whitwell's backyard but fled when a sensor light came on as they approached the shed.
Holmes pleaded guilty to aggravated serious criminal trespass and was today handed a 17-month suspended sentence.
Her lawyer Andrew Culshaw told the court Holmes and Dwyer were very close friends.
"She was a girl who didn't have many friends. Ms Holmes regarded Ms Dwyer as her only friend," he said.
Mr Culshaw said his client intended to steal thousands of dollars from Mr Whitwell but believed "no-one would notice" because of the large amount of cash that was in the shed.
The court heard Mr Whitwell reported the trespass after noticing the garage door partly open the following day and finding a milk crate they had used to jump his fence.
Mr Culshaw had asked that Holmes receive a suspended sentence because she had made "full and frank" admissions to police and assisted with their investigations into Mr Whitwell's murder.
"My client did a monumentally stupid thing ...[but] what happened some months later was nothing to do with my client or this offending," he said.
