  <title>Cats skipper expects 'simple' surgery on ankle</title>
  <content>
GEELONG captain Joel Selwood says surgery on his ankle will be "simple" following a syndesmosis ankle injury suffered against Sydney on Friday night.

Selwood has been ruled out for the remainder of the home-and-away season, with the Cats confident the captain will be back for finals.

The midfielder gave an update on his injury this morning.

"Obviously I didn't get the scan results I was hoping for on the weekend," he said in a video for 20FOUR.

"The ankle was actually feeling not too bad on Saturday but after catching up with the specialist we decided we'll have surgery.

"It's as simple as a tighten up of the ankle so I'll go and have that done and miss the remainder of the home-and-away season but be ready for what's next after that."
