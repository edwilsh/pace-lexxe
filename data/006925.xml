Alanis Morissette embraces the 'angry' tag decades after hit album

As her hit album Jagged Little Pill turns 20, the Canadian singer says being labelled angry is "so lovely."

The gigs will be held at Melbourne's Palais Theatre on Tuesday January 23 and Sydney's ICC Theatre on Wednesday January 24.
Billed as "acoustic and intimate", the shows will mark the singer's first performances in Australia since 1999, when she toured her fourth album Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie.Photo: Rick Wood
The gigs will see the Grammy-winning star performing songs "spanning her entire career in an intimate acoustic trio setting," a press release said.
Morissette, 43, hasn't released an album since 2012's coolly received Havoc and Bright Lights, instead focusing on her monthly podcast Conversation with Alanis Morissette and a regular advice column for The Guardian. She has also been involved in charitable work with the UN, and gave birth to her second child Onyx last July.

However, she returned with a few high-profile appearances in the past couple of years - including a viral cameo on James Corden's late night show, where she updated the lyrics to her oft-discussed anthem Ironic - as fans celebrated the 20th anniversary re-release of her seminal 1995 album Jagged Little Pill.

"Thankfully, the stories that were being told I can stand by, so I'm not cringing when I repeat them," Morissette told Elle last year about still performing the brutally bare songs that made her an icon.
"There was a timelessness to what I was expressing... When I wrote [Jagged Little Pill] I was in a bit of a vacuum, and then when people connected with it, I realised that I was being given this opportunity to support and uplift and empathise with people."
Tickets to the gigs go on sale on Monday August 7 at 9am AEST.
