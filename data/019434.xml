  <content>
A MAN who went missing on the Canning Stock Route in remote Western Australia has been found.
Anthony Collis, 32, was travelling to Darwin with a 39-year-old woman.
They were in a white Mitsubishi Triton but became separated late on Thursday afternoon.
On Thursday night, police received information from travellers after the woman walked into the Georgia Bore Camp, about 8.2km north of Well 22 on the Canning Stock Route.
She then helped police, who launched a major search at first light on Friday.
The search includes local police, the highly trained Tactical Response Group trackers, a plane from the police airwing and State Emergency Service volunteers.
The Mitsubishi Triton was found on Friday afternoon about 1km north of Well 22, but Mr Collis was not with the vehicle and there were serious concerns for his welfare.
Police announced that Mr Collis had been found alive and well this morning.
Police found him about 8am, approximately 1km north of Well 22.
"He is dehydrated and suffering from exposure, but otherwise fine," a spokesperson said.
"He is currently being flown by helicopter to Newman Hospital for treatment."
