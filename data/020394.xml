  <title>David Warner regrets way Australian cricket's pay dispute played out in media</title>
  <content>
The most vocal of Australia's senior players during the recent cricket pay war, David Warner says he regrets the way the issue played out in the media.
After months of negotiations, the Australian Cricketers Association last week agreed to a new memorandum of understanding with Cricket Australia, retaining the revenue-sharing concept that had been the source of much debate.

War of words that turned cricket's pay war ugly

The cricket pay war, now resolved, turned nasty as rival parties traded verbal barbs.

The industrial dispute had led to the cancellation of an Australia A tour of South Africa, and had placed tours of Bangladesh, India, and even the  Ashes series in doubt.

However speaking on Sunday, Warner said the way the saga played out was unfortunate. "We regret the way it's been played out in the media." he told Channel Nine's Sports Sunday.
"This is done and dusted and some wounds need to be healed."

However Warner rejected  a suggestion that his combative approach - in contrast to that of skipper Steve Smith - would prevent the opener from ever captaining his country.

Warner said in June that Smith could "probably push more" in relation to the dispute, but clarified on Sunday that the pair had spoken and understood each other's stances.
"I was going to take it upon myself and represent the players and be more vocal and he was sort of going to go behind closed doors and get them talking and make sure he was on the same page with the ACA and Cricket Australia," he said. "The way he went about it was how he wanted to play it and I was always going to come out and be vocal and sticking up for the players."
Warner will this week join teammates at a training camp in Darwin ahead of the two-Test tour of Bangladesh which begins later in the month. Leg-spinner Mitchell Swepson and seamer Jackson Bird were both  on Saturday, with Victorian quick James Pattinson again struck down by a back injury. CA remains hopeful Pattinson will be fit for the start of the Ashes in November.
