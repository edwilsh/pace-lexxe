  <title>Adelaide's Adut shines in David Jones campaign</title>
  <content>
OUR international catwalk queen Adut Akech is reigning supreme in David Jones spring summer campaign.
Shining in a gold dress by Bec & Bridge, the 17-year-old, who is a year 12 student at St Columba College in Andrews Farm is starring alongside Australian Victoria's Secret supermodel Bridget Malcolm and Indigenous supermodel Charlee Fraser.
"To be chosen for this fantastic opportunity with this iconic store was a real honour," Adut said.
Adut, who was born in South Sudan and came to Australia as a refugee at six years old, was discovered last year when she walked into Melbourne's Chadwick Models while on holiday.
Also represented in Adelaide by Finesse Models Australia, Adut was strutting the runway for Saint Laurent in Paris just six months after being discovered.
Earlier this year she was chosen to feature in Pirelli's all-black celebrity calendar with names like Naomi Campbell and Whoopi Goldberg.
While Adut won't be modelling at the David Jones season launch in Sydney on Wednesday because she is now contracted to walk exclusively for Saint Laurent, she has previously appeared in the retailer's parades.
