  <title>Will & Grace reboot gets second series</title>
  <content>
The reboot of the hit sitcom Will & Grace has been handed a second series before the first has even aired.
As stars Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Megan Mullaly and Sean Hayes returned to the set 12 years after the original run ended, NBC said the revival would be renewed.
The network announced the 13-episode second series at the Television Critics Association publicity tour on Thursday, and also revealed the series had been increased from 12 episodes to 16.
The stars of the sitcom have been teasing about the reboot this week by posting photos of their reunion on set.
Messing told US news site Entertainment Tonight her character, Grace Adler, was "doing incredibly well in her professional life".
"She really has just advanced a lot and she is single and, for reasons that will be explained, Will and Grace are living together once again," she said.
The new series is expected to air in the US on September 28.
