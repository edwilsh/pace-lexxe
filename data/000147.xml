  <title>LABOR'S DANGEROUS NEW TRIBALISM</title>
  <content>
Labor leader Bill Shorten picked the wrong time to call for . Australia is fragmenting and the watchword now is loyalty.
Proof: Labor has an MP like Khalil Eideh, who has pledged his "absolute loyalty" to the bloody dictator of Syria.
So it was a mistake for Shorten on Saturday to promise a , breaking the oath he swore last year at the opening of the 45th Parliament to "bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Her heirs and successors".
It was an even bigger mistake for this oath-breaker to call for a republic while standing in front of a single flag - not the Australian one but the Aboriginal, the flag of apartheid.
Shorten couldn't be clearer: the Left will divide us into tribes, without a common law or allegiance. He already supports changing the Constitution so Aboriginal Australians get different rights, including an Aboriginal parliament. Breaking the old bonds will just hasten this descent into tribalism.
You see, I do not trust Labor to invent new loyalties that bind us as well as have the old. And Eideh is a warning.
