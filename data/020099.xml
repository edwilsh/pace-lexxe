  <title>Hill snares second place in gruelling Norseman Xtreme</title>
  <content>
TRIATHLON: Peregian Beach's Meredith Hill has claimed second place in the gruelling Norseman Xtreme triathlon in Norway.
The physiotherapist conquered the 226km course, which included a 3.8km swim in cold water and a mountainous 180km ride and 42.2km run, in 12hrs16min50sec.
She finished 12 minutes behind the winner, Norwegian Ann Nevin.
Hill prepared for the brutal race by riding the hills of Buderim more than 20 times on a long ride.
She also did run repetitions of Mt Coolum and hauled 10kg packs up stairs.
"I have thought about the race for four-five years. It's one of those bucket-list events. I was lucky enough to get a spot in the ballot," she told Multi-Sport Mecca recently.
Hill did a 'warm'-up event last month, when she was fourth at Challenge Iceland, in her first race as an elite competitor.
That was half the distance of Norseman Xtreme and it was her first race since the Ironman 70.3 World Championships on the Sunshine Coast in September.
She was sidelined with a stress fracture of the sacrum but recovered by March and has since emerged as one of the globe's toughest iron racers.
