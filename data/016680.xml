  <title>Made in SA, inspired by Africa</title>
  <content>
THEY'RE flourishing in the wilds of South Australia - but for this batch of playful cheetah cubs their names were inspired by Africa.
After receiving more than 200 name suggestions from the public, Monarto Zoo keepers had the deciding say on their favourites yesterday.
The Advertiser can reveal the chosen names for the female cubs are Zari (golden), Ayana (pretty flower) and Tafara (we are happy).
The fourth female was named Imani, meaning faith, by keepers after she treated for an infection aged 10 weeks.
Their brother has been named Akiki - which means friend.
They definitely keep mum (Kesho) on her toes as they explore absolutely everything from climbing trees to splashing in puddles," Monarto Zoo carnivore keeper Gale Akerman said.
