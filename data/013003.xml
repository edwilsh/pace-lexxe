  <title>Dog attack: Animal behaviourists say it's not breeds that are dangerous, it's their environment</title>

The death of a woman mauled by a dog in southern Perth yesterday has reignited the debate about whether specific breeds are more dangerous and need to be banned.
Barko's Boarding Kennel owner Sue Lopicich .
The woman was found by her daughter, who came to check on her mother after she failed to turn up for work.
Perth animal rescue service Dogs Behind Bars Rescue issued a statement today, saying they were heartbroken to hear of Ms Lopicich's passing, but also concerned about the attention paid to the bull mastiff breed as a result.
"There has been much speculation about how these tragic events came about," the statement said.
"What we do know is that Sue would be horrified by the attention being on background or breed of the dog involved in this sad situation."

Veterinarian and animal behaviourist Kate Lindsey said there was no such thing as an aggressive breed.
"Aggressive behaviour can occur in any breed, just like aggression can occur in any person, given the right circumstances," she said.
"The three factors that drive any behaviours are genetics, environment and experience."
Dr Lindsey said a dog attack against its owner was an incredibly rare event, and it was dangerous to blame it on a breed.

Watch out for:

Signs of fear or anxiety include: the dog wants space, lunges barks or growls, freezes or stares
Signs of stress include: yawning, stiff body, a high tail or tucking it under its body
Ears back, closed mouth and visible whites of eyes

"We have to be careful not to generalise that it is a behaviour that is specific to a certain breed," she said.
"There are many wonderful, mixed-breed bull mastiff staffies out there that are incredibly loving members of their family."
Ms Lindsey said she looked at the vision of the dog issued by the pound, and it was exhibiting signs it was frightened and anxious.

"So this is a very behaviourally unwell dog, that has been in a very specific set of circumstances, that has led to the inadvertent injury and death of a very compassionate dog lover.
"And there is always a trigger. These behaviours are very unlikely to occur for no reason."
Banning breeds doesn't work: RSPCA

RSPCA Victoria chief executive Liz Walker told the ABC legislation outlawing breeds did not work.
"We firmly believe every dog needs to be assessed individually," she said.
"Their genetics, there learning and environment, it really the holy trilogy in setting them up to be aggressive or not.
"The genetics loads the gun, but the environment and the training will shoot it."
Family friend says dog was abused

A family friend of Ms Lopicich's, Lee, told local radio station that her dog was known to be aggressive.
"The dog that she had, it was well known for being aggressive, but she loved it anyway," he said.
"Being a rescue dog, it doesn't matter what the breed is, any dog can be aggressive if it is abused as a young dog.
"Just like any dog can be a beautiful, loving dog regardless of the breed."
Friend Toni Donnelly, who finds homes for unwanted greyhounds in Western Australia and has worked closely with Ms Lopicich for about five years, said the animal lover had volunteered to foster animals they struggled to home.
Ms Donnelly said Stirling, the dog which purportedly attacked Ms Lopicich, was one of seven dogs she owned.
"The bull mastiff was basically left on their hands a few years ago because they knew that it had a troubled past, and that nobody would want to adopt it," Ms Donnelly said.
"She and Michael [Sue's husband] took the dog on because that is the kind of people they were.
"She will be so sorely missed ... there are so many people grateful to Sue for what she has done - for them and for their dogs."
The City of Gosnells confirmed today the bull mastiff police have confirmed responsible for the death of Mrs Lopicich was humanely euthanased by a vet this morning.
