  <title>Origin Energy doubles full-year oil and gas revenue </title>
  <content>
Origin Energy's full-year oil and gas production has lifted by 40 per cent and its revenue more than doubled.
Production in the year to June 30 rose to 323 petajoules, helped by the ramp-up of operations at its Australia Pacific liquefied natural gas project in Queensland, while revenue lifted to $2.2 billion on increased production and higher prices.Photo: Louie Douvis
June-quarter production was up 12 per cent on the March quarter, to 89.2 petajoules, while oil & gas sales revenue was up nearly 20 per cent from the previous three months, at $673.4 million.
