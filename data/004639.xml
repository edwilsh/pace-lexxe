  <content>
THERE'S been some perfect weather for the winter sports and youngsters around the region have been making the most of it.
Netballers have been competing regularly at the Maroochydore Multi-Sports Complex at Kuluin, where there are 16 lit hard courts and 10 grass courts.
The venue, which is home to the Sunshine Coast Netball Association, attracts droves of teams from around the region, including Mountain Creek Magic and Immanuel Incredibles.
There's real enthusiasm for the sport in the region too, following the success of the Lightning on the national league stage.
The Sunshine Coast team won the Super Netball premiership in its first season.
