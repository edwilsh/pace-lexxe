DETECTIVES have arrested two men - including a retained firefighter - over bushfires in the Coalfields.
Police revealed the 28-year-old firefighter was arrested on Hall Street, Weston, and charged with four counts of intentionally causing a fire and concealing a serious indictable offence of another person.

The charges relate to fires on January 18 at Chinamans Hollow, Loxford and Kurri Kurri.
Another man, 27, will front court on Wednesday after he was arrested by police on Tuesday.
That man was charged with three counts of intentionally causing a fire and was refused bail.
The arrests come after the establishment of Strike Force Hingerty, which was formed in the wake of the bushfires, which ran over several weeks and threatened property.
Strike Force detectives are continuing their investigations into the cause of the fires.
