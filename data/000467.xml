  <title>Matildas continue their giant-killing run</title>
  <content>
ON Friday, the Matildas made history with a first ever win over world champions the USA.
On Monday, they've done it again, this time with a big 4-2 win over Asian champions Japan to go to the top of the table in the Tournament of Nations.
Led by a brilliant first-half Sam Kerr hat-trick, Emily Van Egmond then scored a penalty on the hour mark to recover from a horror start after Japan took the lead six minutes into the match.
But that only served to kick the Aussies into gear, who themselves had a good chance just 60 seconds into the match.
Up stepped Kerr, who hit a lethal double in five minutes.
Her first came after Elise Kellond-Knight played Hayley Raso in behind, with the right winger flying beyond Japan's back four to square the ball to Kerr for a tap in on 11 minutes.
Then Kerr did it herself in the 16th minute, winning the ball back high up the field to race in behind one-on-one with the goalkeeper to score.
And just as Japan probed for an equaliser on the stroke of half-time, Kerr scored a break away solo goal to seal her hat-trick.
Japan then scored a late consolation goal in the second minute of stoppage time, but it was Kerr who stole the show.
You can watch the Matildas v Brazil in the Tournament of Nations from 9.10am AEST Friday on Fox Sports 503.
