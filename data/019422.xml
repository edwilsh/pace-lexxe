  <title>No silver lining for Aussie champion this time</title>
  <content>
TWO years ago Fabrice Lapierre left the world championships with a long jump silver medal around his neck.
BOLT UPSTAGED:
On Sunday morning (EST) the Australian champion didn't even get to complete the final, relegated to 11th position and cut from the competition after the opening three jumps.
Unfortunately since his career high in Beijing in 2015, Lapierre has struggled.
Last year at the Rio Olympics he was one of the gold medal favourites but bombed in the final and finished a disappointing 10th.
After a solid opening leap of 7.89m, Lapierre was unable to improve enough with his best leap of 7.93m not cutting it in what was a hot competition.
South Africa's Luvo Manyonga, the silver medallist in Rio, took gold with 8.48m from America's Jarrion Lawson 8.44m.
In the women's 10,000m, it was a stroll in the park for Ethiopia's world record holder Almaz Ayana who won by more than 200m clocking 30min16.32sec.
Ayana, the reigning Olympic champion, decided to make it a race on her own at the half-way mark and no-one got near her from then on.
Her teammate, Tirunesh Dibaba, won silver in 31:02.69sec with Kenya's Agnes Jebet Tirop taking bronze (31:03.50sec).
"I am very happy to win this title, much more than when I won the Olympic gold because I have been sick this year and didn't expect it," Ayana said.
"In fact, this was my first race of 2017."
The first Aussie home was Eloise Wellings in 22nd position (32:26.31sec) with Madeline Hills coming in 26th (32:48.57sec).
