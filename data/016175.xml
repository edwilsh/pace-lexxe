Frankston are back in the VFL. AFL Victoria confirmed on Friday that the club had been re-admitted for the 2018 season after its application - put before the AFL Victoria board last month - had been approved.

"AFL Victoria was always committed to continuing to work with key stakeholders in the region - including Frankston FC - to ensure there would be a state-league presence there into the future," AFL Victoria chief Steven Reaper said.
"The Frankston FC and all involved have shown their commitment to regain their licence in the VFL, establishing a strong strategic plan focused on governance, community engagement, sponsorship and membership that will assist the club and the region into the future."
