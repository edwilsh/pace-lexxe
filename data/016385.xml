Inside a small suburban art gallery in the New South Wales city of Newcastle, a group of Aboriginal artists are putting the final additions on a major piece of work.
A hum of excited chatter filled the room, as the artists hunched over sheets of canvas, flicking paint across the material.
The artists were working on a major sculpture that will go on show on the shores of Sydney's glistening harbour at Barangaroo Reserve this weekend.
It is hoped the sculpture, which takes the form of 11 ship masts draped with sails representing the First Fleet, will prompt discussions about reconciliation.
The sails will be painted on one side with Aboriginal art, and on the other side with white paint.
It will be hard to miss the sculpture, which measures 20 metres long by almost 5m high.

"I thought it would be visually spectacular, but also a political statement that would be really easily recognisable," lead artist Tereasa Trevor, a Yuin woman, said.
"I've since come to think that actually it's not Indigenous painting on the sails, but actually a reflection of the culture and the land.
"So, it's almost like the sails are mirrors for the culture that existed here prior to the arrival of the First Fleet."
Sculpture a celebration of diversity

The sculpture has been a meeting of minds, with Ms Trevor leading the project involving other Aboriginal artists, including some living with a disability.
"I think it's really immediately apparent that there's been a whole host of people who've contributed to this work - everything from young people through to experienced, well-respected artists," she said.
"I think what you can see in the work is a cooperation, a celebration, and a vibrancy of culture.
"What I hope is that people can understand there is so much more to Indigenous culture than the stereotypical beliefs that people [have].
"The culture is so worth preserving, understanding, knowing about, learning about, and ultimately, celebrating."
Promoting meaningful conversation through art

Aboriginal elder Aunty Denise Bloomfield has been involved in the project.
She said expressing herself through a sculpture intended for such a prominent location had been therapeutic.
"I'm a Stolen Gen, and it's helped me to release a lot of the pain that I've had over the years," she said.
"It's given me an outlet which has been quite enjoyable and fulfilling, and healing as well."

Aunty Denise hoped the sculpture would build upon conversations around reconciliation and Indigenous recognition.
"What I'd love for [non-Indigenous people] to take away is that we're just like them," she said.
"We hurt, and we feel pain, and we feel love too.
"Hopefully we can finally unite as a nation, and I mean actually look at each other and see each other as brother and sister, not as enemy or foe.
"[What] I'd like to see [is] reconciliation between both cultures, and to see it permanent, because it's important, [and] because we're falling apart as we know it.
"It'd be lovely just to see everyone look at each other and just get along. It's not hard to do."
