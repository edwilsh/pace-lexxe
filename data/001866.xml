  <title>Sydney airport fell short in response to terror alert</title>
  <content>
Travelling from Sydney to Perth on Sunday I was aware of an active counter-terrorism operation in Sydney and was warned of delays due to "enhanced" screening. Yet, the security methodology being used was surprising. Passenger and carry-on baggage screening stations, that are generally otherwise open, were closed, creating extended lines in the departure lounge. Nor did the actual screening process I went through appear to be any different to normal. The only difference was the creation of a large, vulnerable crowd left standing in the departure terminal.
Attacks on airport terminals have been occurring and should not be ruled out. In March 2016, three coordinated suicide bombings occurred in Belgium: two at Brussels Airport in Zaventem, and one at a central city rail station. The two suicide bombers carried large suitcases filled with explosives into the departure hall, killing 32 civilians and injuring more than 300 people. Another bomb was found during a search of the airport. In June 2016 at Ataturk Airport in Istanbul,.

Sydney arrests: Travellers brace for delays

Expect extra airport security checks after the Sydney Joint Counter Terrorism teams conducted anti-terror raids over an alleged planned attack. Vision: Seven News

Yet in Sydney on Sunday, uniformed police hovered close to the passenger screening process but there were no police outside the terminal or at main entry doors. Add all this to frequent security announcements over the PA. There appeared an obvious intent to create a sense of security at screening points but instead the outcome was to create anxiety and an attack point in the terminal.
What's the alternative? The Smart Security Project, a joint initiative of the International Air Transport Association and Airports Council International, envisions a future where passengers proceed through security checkpoints with minimal inconvenience, where security resources are allocated based on risk, and where airport facilities are optimised, thus contributing towards an improved journey from curb to airside. I think Sydney's domestic airport was a long way from achieving this on Sunday.

Without any charges yet being laid against those taken into custody, or confirmation that police were aware of an active or imminent threat against airlines or airports, the question should be asked, why create such a sense of anxiety and why create a mass gathering in the departure lounge?
Unless the risk had changed, which means the national terrorism threat level should also change, it would be preferable and reasonable to continue, or appear to continue as normal and process passengers with minimal inconvenience and the greatest efficiency. If the risk remained uncertain, then deploy additional, plain-clothes officers into departure lounges and if something specific is being searched for, either announce it to increase the chance of reporting or use intelligence sources to target searches.Photo: Michele Mossop
Australians should not be complacent but nor do I think they should they succumb to accepting statements from politicians who speak out claiming success, while investigations, searches and interviews are ongoing. The police commissioners asked for the community to be patient, while they do their job. This is something the politicians should adopt. The media also has a responsibility to not over report on counter-terrorism operations, which only spurs political response and generates a "need to be seen to be doing something", as security is as much a perception as an outcome. I would prefer a much calmer, nuanced approach and patience all-round until police actually have something to announce.
