  <title>Ousted cop in Damond case wins award</title>
  <content>
OUSTED Minneapolis police chief Janee Harteau, who remained on holidays in the aftermath of the fatal police shooting of Australia's Justine Damond, has won an award.
Ms Harteau was named the 2017 Woman Law Enforcement Executive of the Year on Thursday.
The former chief resigned after Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges announced less than a week after Ms Damond's death she had "lost confidence in the chief's ability to lead us further".
Ms Damond, a 40-year-old life coach originally from Sydney's northern beaches, called 911 just before midnight on July 15 after she thought she heard a woman near her Minneapolis home being raped.
Officer Mohamed Noor arrived in a patrol car and shot Ms Damond dead as she approached the driver's side window.
Officer Noor and his partner did not have their body or dash cameras on. Ms Harteau continued her holiday for four days instead of immediately returning to Minneapolis after Ms Damond's death.
The former chief told reporters she was "backpacking in the mountains" and "had intermittent phone service".
She received the award at the annual conference of National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives in Kansas City.
"Chief Janee Harteau has made a real difference for the police officers and citizens of Minneapolis, and those she has touched through her various teaching, mentoring and speaking engagements," NAWLEE officials said in a statement.
The news of Harteau's award came after Justine Damond's family released details of the public memorial service for her, scheduled for Friday, August 11th at 6pm (local time) at the Lake Harriet Band Shell in Minneapolis.
The shooting is still shrouded in mystery because the investigating agency, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, has released few details and it was not captured on camera.
The memorial will include remarks from her fiance Don Damond, her father John Ruszczyk and other friends and family of the 40-year-old life coach.
The memorial service will also include music by Minnesota pianist Steven C Anderson and a multimedia presentation celebrating Damond's life.
Mourners are asked to honour Damond by wearing blue, one of her signature colours, and will also have an opportunity to write a special message about how her life touched the world.
Family spokesman Tom Hyderthat her fiance wanted the picturesque outdoor location, believing it would be a fitting venue.
Damond was born in 1977 and grew up in Sydney's North Beaches. As a spiritual healer and meditation coach, Damond focused her life on healing others.
She planned to wed her fiance in August 2017.
