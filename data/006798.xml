A man arrested by counter-terrorism police over an alleged plot to attack a plane has been released from police custody in Sydney without charge.
Four men were arrested by the New South Wales Joint Counter-Terrorism team on Saturday after intelligence reports of a plot to take down a passenger plane using an improvised device.
A 50-year-old man was released from police custody last night. A further three men remain in custody.
