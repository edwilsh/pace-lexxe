  <title>Truck hits bridge, Brisbane trains delayed</title>
  <content>
Brisbane commuters have been warned of delays of up to an hour after a truck hit a bridge in the city's south.
A truck, higher than the maximum height, struck the bridge near Rocklea Station just before 8am on Thursday.
A spokeswoman for Queensland Rail says the bridge must be assessed before a train can safely cross, warning of significant delays on the Beenleigh, Gold Coast, Airport and Ferny Grove lines.
