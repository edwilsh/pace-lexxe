  <title>Man jumped on moving cab</title>
  <content>
A MAN was rushed to hospital in a critical condition overnight after he allegedly jumped onto a moving taxi at Cannonvale, near Airlie Beach.
Initial investigations suggest the 36-year-old man ran in front of the taxi at Waterson Way about 9pm, before he jumped onto the bonnet and the roof.
He seriously injured his head as he fell from the moving vehicle.
Police administered immediate first aid when they responded to the incident before the man was taken to Proserpine Hospital.
He was later flown to Townsville hospital where he remains in a critical but stable condition.
The Forensic Crash Unit will investigate the incident.
In a separate incident at Bundaberg, a 25-year-old man was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries after a two-car crash on Childers Rd.
The driver of the other vehicle, a 43-year-old man, was also taken to hospital.
The road was closed for some time, but has since reopened.
Police are investigating the incident.
