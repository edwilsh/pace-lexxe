  <title>HSC standards 'improved NAPLAN results'</title>
  <content>
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has credited new minimum standards required for HSC candidates for the state's improved NAPLAN results.
NSW year 9 students have risen to first in the nation for numeracy and spelling, while overall, the state's students ranked in the top three for all tests in all years.
"I'm pleased that the NAPLAN results have improved on last year and have put NSW at the head of the pack in a number of key areas across the nation," Ms Berejiklian told reporters at a high school in Sydney's south on Wednesday.
From 2020 minimum standards for literacy and numeracy are required for students to receive the HSC and the premier says that's the main reason NSW improved its performance this year.
"We don't apologise for making the standards higher," she said.
