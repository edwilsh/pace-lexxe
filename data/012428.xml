  <title>Dramatic arrest on Industrial Drive</title>
  <content>
A POLICE chase that began in Port Stephens has ended with a dramatic arrest in front of scores of motorists on Industrial Drive.
A wanted man, 19, was pulled over in Medowie about 9.15am in a Holden sedan.
However, police said as they approached the car, the Holden started to reverse, "striking one officer and causing minor injuries".
A police officer attempted to stop the car, but was unsuccessful, with the driver accelerating away, a statement said.

A pursuit ensued but was terminated by police in Williamtown due to safety concerns.
A short time later, police located the Holden in Mayfield, but the car broke down on Industrial Drive.

With the driver's luck running out, it is alleged he made a dash on foot and attempted to enter the cab of a truck. Police allege he assaulted the truck driver.
Police said the 19-year-old was pulled from the vehicle and arrested.
The driver's passengers, a 20-year-old woman and a 17-year-old boy, were earlier arrested.
The woman and the boy were released without charge.
The 19-year-old was taken to hospital with minor injuries.

He is expected to be charged with a number of outstanding warrants and other offences.
