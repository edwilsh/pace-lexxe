HAVING a celebrity wear your clothes translates into huge business for a designer. And some of the world's most influential style stars are wearing Australian labels.
The latest is Kim Kardashian, who has sizzled in a white, custom-made bikini by Sahara Ray Swim - the eponymous label of Los Angeles-based, Australian-raised Instagram model Sahara Ray.
Kardashian, 36, showed off her famous curves in the high-cut bikini bottoms, which Ray said were "custom made" for Kardashian (and, as of today, available online for about $105).
Kardashian had previously been photographed wearing the label's Cindy bikini top ($110).
She's not the first celeb to turn heads in an Aussie label, prompting global attention.

Realisation Par, another Los Angeles-based Australian-run label, has a huge celebrity following. Bella Hadid, 20, has been pictured recently wearing one of cult brand's dresses, as has Kylie Jenner's BFF Jordan Woods (along with a string of Aussies including Margot Robbie, Phoebe Tonkin and Jessica Gomes).
When Hadid and Kendall Jenner wore tops by Bec + Bridge last week, the Sydney-based label was inundated with inquiries from shoppers wanting to buy the garments (for the record, they don't hit stores until about October).
So how much influence do the current brand of social media stars have when it comes to fashion sales?
A lot, it seems.

"When girls such and Kendall and Bella wear Bec + Bridge, it definitely translates to direct online sales for us," designer Bec Cooper, one half of Bec + bridge, told News Corp Australia.

"We are very lucky to have such a strong celebrity following for the brand both locally and internationally," Cooper said.
"It definitely helps you get noticed when such amazing 'it' girls are wearing our pieces.
"The reaction has been very positive.
"The girls have such an incredible sense of style both on and off duty, so it is always such a thrill when we see them in our designs."

And while shoppers can buy what Kardashian and co are wearing at the click of a mouse, Cooper points out that there is another component to being stylish.
"It's important to know how to put a look together, and to understand that less is often more," she said.
"The Bec + Bridge girl is all about understated cool."
Bec + Bridge's spring/summer 2018 collection will be shown on the catwalk at David Jones' launch in Sydney this week.
