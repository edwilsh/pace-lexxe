  <title>Labor set to reject $3 billion casino</title>
  <content>
THE State Government is set to torpedo a $3 billion casino resort earmarked for the Gold Coast's Southport Spit.
Chinese-backed company ASF had planned a five-tower integrated resort, including a casino, on Crown land on the Spit.
ASF had been named as the preferred proponent for the resort and a second Coast casino.
But The Courier-Mail understands Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and State Development Minister Anthony Lynham are set to announce the project's death knell at a press conference at noon today, where they are expected to announce a three-storey height limit for the area as well as a master plan.
The project would have been a major job creator but was unpopular with many locals.
Opposers, led by former Beattie government minister Judy Spence, had railed against the ASF proposal.
Mayor Tom Tate's plans for a cruise ship terminal on the Spit are not expected to be impacted by the Government's decision.
It comes a month after ASF Consortium director  he was in talks with Caesars Entertainment regarding the proposal.
"ASF Consortium has been in ongoing discussions with a number of world-class operators," he said in July.
