  <title>Holman hangs on final hope</title>
  <content>
Gosford goalkeeper Nick Holman is hopeful of returning for a premiership push and a second national championships but remains realistic about the 12 centimetre tear in his hamstring.  
The NSW squad member for November's Australian Hockey League in Perth has begun rehabilitation on the injury, which was sustained playing for Gordon-North Sydney recently, in a bid to get back on the field as soon as possible.

"It [the tear] is a pretty big one and I don't know exactly how long I'll be out for, but I'm just trying to get back as quick as I can," Holman said. 

"I probably won't be able to play any more regular season games so finals are definitely the goal and then strive to stay in AHL."  

Gosford were beaten in last year's Hunter Coast Premier Hockey League grand final and the undefeated leaders meet third-placed Souths at Newcastle International Hockey Centre on Sunday in the first of two top-four clashes.  
Round 18 also sees semi-final bound Maitland call on junior representatives Tom Forbes and Ryan Simpson when they host second-placed Norths, who are down James Piper. 

Sunday's remaining encounter between The Entrance and University on the Central Coast shapes as a battle for the wooden spoon. The Students are missing Andrew Nash at the Australian Country Championships.
Wests have the bye.
Meanwhile, Souths' Ehren Hazell, who is unavailable this weekend, was on Friday named in the Australian junior men's squad to defend the Sultan of Johor Cup in Malaysia in October.
