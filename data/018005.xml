  <title>Real sorry Madrid: Mbappe injured in Ligue 1 opener</title>
  <content>
FRENCH champions Monaco have opened their Ligue 1 title defence with a 3-2 comeback win at home against Toulouse on Friday.
They showed the same attacking flair that took them to the top of the league last season although the victory was tainted by an injury sustained by Kylian Mbappe in the second half.
Mbappe, the 18-year-old linked with a move to Real Madrid and Barcelona, left the field after 74 minutes with an apparent knee injury.

Football: Monaco back on the Ligue 1 board.

Monaco back on the Ligue 1 board
Although they looked shaky at the back, Leonardo Jardim's team, who scored 107 goals last term, were too hot to handle for Toulouse as they prevailed with goals by Jemerson, Radamel Falcao and Kamil Glik.
Toulouse twice went ahead thanks to goals from Zinedine Machach and Andy Delort, before collapsing under pressure.
Last year's runner-ups Paris Saint-Germain open their campaign on Saturday against Amiens with record signing Neymar to be presented at the Parc des Princes after joining from Barcelona for a world record 222 million euros ($A332m) fee.
Monaco's defence were caught snoozing in the sixth minute when they allowed Machach to volley past Danijel Subasic from just outside the box.
It did not take the hosts too long, though, to react and in the 28th minute, Jemerson equalised with a fine header from Joao Moutinho's corner kick.
New signing Rony Lopes was the most dangerous Monaco player, although the Toulouse defence proved to be a tough nut to crack.
Eight minutes into the second half the principality side fell behind again. Fullback Djibril Sidibe lost the ball in his own half to Jimmy Durmaz, who set up Delort, the striker coolly slotting the ball home from just inside the box. Monaco drew level when Falcao netted his 33rd goal in 50 league games with Monaco, heading home from Mbappe's cross.
In the 70th, Glik sent another header past Alban Lafont, deflecting Moutinho's free kick to put Monaco ahead for the first time.
RANIERI'S NANTES 'NOT READY' FOR LIGUE 1 OPENER
Claudio Ranieri admitted that his Nantes side are "not ready" for the start of the new season, as the Italian prepares to make his Ligue 1 bow on Sunday at Lille.
"We are not ready, but I've never known a team that's been ready for the first day (of a season)," Ranieri said on Friday.
"I am also expecting a few new players (before the end of the transfer window)." It will be the 65-year-old's first competitive match since being sacked by Leicester City in February, just nine months after leading the Foxes to a staggering Premier League title.
He had to receive special dispensation from the French league to become the Canaries' boss in June because of rules regarding coaches aged over 65.
But Ranieri will return to the bench on Sunday, when he goes up against fellow newcomer Marcelo Bielsa of Lille.
Ranieri has only made two first-team signings in the close season so far and one of those, Romanian international goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu, is out injured.
