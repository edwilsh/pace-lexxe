  <title>Rogic's Celtic squeeze through in Champions League</title>
  <content>
Scottish champions Celtic squeezed past Rosenborg to qualify for the playoff round of the Champions League, but there was no such joy for four times European champions Ajax Amsterdam, who were eliminated.
Ajax were dumped out after a 2-2 draw at home to Nice on Wednesday and will rue some sloppy defending as Nice scored twice in Amsterdam after a 1-1 draw in France to go through on away goals.

Plays of the Week

Nail-biting finishes, ripping yorkers and hat-trick heroes, these are the plays of the week.

Vincent Marcel grabbed a 79th-minute equaliser for Nice after Ajax's Donny van de Beek and Davinson Sanchez had cancelled out Arnaud Souquet's early opener for the French side.

They struggled to break down the Norwegians and had James Forrest to thank as he found the net in the 69th minute, firing home from a tight angle to put Brendan Rodgers' side through with a 1-0 victory.
There was plenty of drama in Berne as Swiss side Young Boys recovered from a 3-1 defeat away to Dynamo Kiev, winning 2-0 at home to go through on away goals.

FC Copenhagen hammered FK Vardar 4-1 at the Parken stadium in the Danish capital to go through 4-2 on aggregate, while Turkish league runners-up Istanbul Basaksehir cruised past Belgian side Club Bruges 2-0 at home to win 5-3 on aggregate.
The successful teams now go forward to the playoff round, with the winners qualifying for the group stage of Europe's lucrative elite club competition.
The draw for the playoff round takes place on August 4.
