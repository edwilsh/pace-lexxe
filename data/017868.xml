  <title>Geelong coach Chris Scott has plenty to lament after Swans smashing</title>
  <content>
Geelong coach Chris Scott says he believes the umpire that awarded a crucial free kick to Sydney player Tom Papley early in the final quarter of the Swans win over the Cats would "be disappointed" with his call.
The free kick and goal to Papley, which was paid for a punch by the Cats Mitch Duncan on Papley, came directly after Dan Hannebery kicked the first goal of the final quarter for the Swans.

Swans slay Cats to make finals statement

Sydney have maintained control over their finals destiny with a convincing 107-61 win over Geelong at Simonds Stadium.

It stretched Sydney's lead to 37 points and ended any chance Geelong had of winning the game.
Asked if he thought the free kick was legitimate, Scott made his thoughts clear.

"I have looked at it, and you're allowed to have an opinion on these things," Scott said. "I think that if the umpire who paid it has a look at the vision I looked at I think he'd be disappointed that he paid it.
"But that's OK, mistakes happen. The more accurate question and the one we're more focused on is why did Mitch [Duncan] do it in the first place?"

Scott then asked a journalist if he thought the decision was wrong.

The journalist said it was, to which Scott said: "Yeah, OK. They didn't go to ground the same way in the contest did they? They were a bit stronger around the ball.Photo: AAP
"I don't want to get into a dialogue about one incident that cost us a goal when we lost by plenty. Clearly we had a chance at three-quarter-time and we just handed our chance back to them.
"I'm not going to sit here and say 'if only mistakes weren't made by the umpires then we would have won the game'. Mistakes were made by our players. If there was a subsequent mistake by the umpires their coaches will pick it up on Monday when they finally get to work."Photo: AAP
Scott also said he was confident star midfielder and captain Joel Selwood would play next week.

"I am confident enough to say now that he will be fine ... we sit here pretty confident that he'll be OK."
Scott said ultimately Sydney took their chances in the match to secure victory and suggested that the Cats were wasteful and were exploited for their lack of depth.
"We thought it was going to be harder than it would have been [if we had] all of our personnel available," Scott said. "Clearly their strength, in terms of personnel, is that when a few good players go out, they brought in Reid and Rohan and Tippett and Lloyd.
"We need to get to that level where if our really good players don't play well or go out we bring in players who can do almost as well."  
The Cats will welcome back Patrick Dangerfield next week after he served his one-match suspension, however Tom Hawkins could be in MRP trouble.
His jumper punch connected with Dane Rampe's chin and given he has already been suspended for striking in a similar incident this year, the Cats forward could miss next week's game against Richmond.
