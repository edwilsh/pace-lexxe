  <title>Aussie 'superstar' justifies 'best on earth' tag</title>
  <content>
AUSSIE football fans, we have our very own 'world's best' and she's been on fire once again in the green and gold.
Matildas star Sam Kerr has capped off a perfect month with a sensational first half hat-trick as the Aussies stunned Asian champions Japan 4-2 in San Diego.
REPORT:
This is no flash in the pan. Kerr has already achieved the standing as the highest ever goalscorer in the US National Women's Soccer League.

She is just 23.
So far this season for Sky Blue FC, Kerr has scored 14 goals in 15 games, at a rate of a goal every 92 minutes.
"It's clear that Sam Kerr's future is now," wrote Richard Farley in a feature on US.

My conversation with  before the game today..
Me: "are you going to score today ?"
Sam: "yeh 3 haha!" No words, freak! 😳🤷🏽‍♀️🔥👏🏽

"A future best player in the world, as we've described her before? Maybe she's ahead of schedule... For some time, there has been no clear best women's player in the world. Kerr has begun to change that."
For Matildas legend Heather Garriock, who watched the rise of the young Aussie from 15, Kerr is a revelation.
"I was just thinking how young she was watching her this morning," said 130-capped ex-Matilda Garriock.

Football: Kerr's dazzling 12 minute treble.

"But when you talk about getting better, she's already in the finest form in the world from a scoring perspective.
"She's started playing as a No.9 which is new for the Matildas but it suits her.
"She's quick, she doesn't have to track back [compared to playing on the wing] and one-on-one she's the best in the world."
Garriock, now head coach of Canberra United in the W-League, added: "She's matured a lot and become a leader in the team. Now she's comfortable in her own skin.

has to be in contention for world player of the year surely!! 👏👏👏
"When you become the W-League player of the year there's expectation when you go to the States.
"But it suits here there because she's a show-women but she's not a show off. She put a lot of pressure on herself but when she took to off and thought she would enjoy it, that brings belief. She just does things naturally because she's so athletic."

Just imagine these Aussie stars 6 years on, in their prime, playing at home in a WC. A girl can dream!! WWC2023

Sam Kerr is a superstar. First half hat trick. Jet.
You can watch the Matildas v Brazil in the Tournament of Nations from 9.10am AEST Friday on Fox Sports 503.
