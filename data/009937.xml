US businesses added a solid 178,000 jobs in July, evidence employers remain confident enough about future demand to keep hiring.
Payroll processor ADP said on Wednesday the biggest gains were in fields such as education and health care and shipping.
Manufacturers actually cut 4000 jobs, while construction firms added 6000. Mining, which includes oil and gas drilling, gained 3000 jobs.
The figures provide some reassurance the US economy remains healthy.
Consumer spending slowed last month as Americans cut back sharply on car purchases but the overall economy grew at a decent 2.6 per cent annual pace in the April-June quarter.
Analysts predict the government's jobs report, to be released Friday, will show a robust 190,000 jobs were added, according to data provider FactSet.
