  <title>Attempted murder charge for sword attack</title>
  <content>
A Perth man accused of attacking a police officer with a samurai sword will have one of his charges upgraded to attempted murder.
WA police allege Milos Radovic, 45, assaulted a senior constable, causing deep wounds to his head, when the officer attended a domestic violence incident in Rockingham on July 19.
Radovic has been charged with a string of offences, including two counts of breaching a violence restraining order.
But police say a charge of intent to maim by unlawful wounding would be upgraded to attempting to unlawfully kill when Radovic appears in Rockingham Magistrates Court on Wednesday.
