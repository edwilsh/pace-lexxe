  <title>Fundies brace for RXP Services raising </title>
  <content>
Fund managers have been asked to take a fresh look at technology and digital services company RXP Services Ltd as it considers going cap in hand to investors.
Sources said RXP Services was working with Shaw and Partners on a potential equity raising, which was slated to be launched as early as Tuesday morning. 
The company is expected to seek to raise $18 million via a placement at 80¢ a share.
The stock closed at 89¢ on Monday.

RXP Services reported $70.6 million revenue for the six months to December 31 and $9.2 million in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. 

The company specialises in digital consulting, which it says helps clients embrace the growing digital economy. 
Its biggest shareholders include chief executive officer Ross Fielding, Oaktel Investments and Regal Funds Management.
