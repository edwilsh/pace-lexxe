  <title>Three more years for top cop</title>
  <content>
POLICE Commissioner Ian Stewart has been reappointed for another three years in the role.

Despite internal criticism about his leadership and morale in the police force, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk today announced Commissioner Stewart's contract was renewed after a Cabinet meeting on the Gold Coast.

"Cabinet has endorsed the recommendation made by (Police) Minister Mark Ryan under the Act," she said.

"It's incredibly important that we have a clear sense of stability in this state."

Ms Palaszczuk also praised Commissioner Stewart's handling of natural disasters such as Cyclone Debbie.

Commissioner Stewart's reappointment comes as he had assured Queenslanders the terror threat remained at probable.

Commissioner Stewart said ensuring stability of command for the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games next year was a key reason he put his hand up for reappointment.

"The main driver for me is that we have the Commonwealth Games almost on our doorstep," he said.

Police Minister Mark Ryan said the reappointment was done under the Act but Commissioner Stewart deserved another three years in the role.

"The Commissioner is doing a great job and in light of those circumstances there was no need to open that up to an open merit process," he said.

"The position of the Government is the Commissioner is doing a great job and we followed the process under the Act and as a result the Commissioner will be hanging around for another three years."
