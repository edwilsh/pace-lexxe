  <title>'Exciting travel change' for Adelaide Metro</title>
  <content>
O-BAHN commuters will soon be able to enter and validate their Metrocards at the middle and rear doors of buses.
The idea is to speed up boarding times as the new O-Bahn tunnel makes the service more popular.
Validation machines started appearing on buses over the past month with a sign saying, "Exciting travel change coming soon!"
A Transport Department spokeswoman said they would become active when the $160 million tunnel from Grenfell St to Hackney Rd opened "later this year".
They will not appear on other routes "for now".
"This may be re-evaluated at a later date," she said.
Extra ticket inspectors will be deployed to explain the new procedure and catch fare evaders.
