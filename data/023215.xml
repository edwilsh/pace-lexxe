There was a time Lakoda Burn lead singer Matt Zammit thought he had it all.
But it was only after a period of reflection and time away from music that the real ''important things in life'' shone through.
Now Zammit and the Wollongong band are truly hitting all the right notes.
Lakoda Burn is again generating plenty of positive buzz around the traps, especially on Facebook and Twitter.
''More importantly our music is now available on Spotify and iTunes,'' Zammit said.
''We've also playing a lot more gigs around the traps where we're playing covers and more original music.''
The four-piece band's next gig is at Towradgi Bowlo on Saturday, August 12.
''But we are playing a host of other gigs which are all posted on our Facebook page. We are also getting a bit of love in America. A DJ from a radio station in LA emailed recently saying they wanted to play our songs Baby We Tried and Window.''
