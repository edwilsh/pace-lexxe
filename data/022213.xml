  <title>Salt Creek attacker to argue appeal</title>
  <content>
The man jailed over the attacks on two female backpackers at Salt Creek will argue an appeal against his convictions next month.
Roman Heinze appeared before the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal on Monday where his case was referred to a sitting of the Full Court on September 20.
In May, Heinze was jailed for at least 17 years after being found guilty of six charges including indecent assault, aggravated kidnapping and endangering life in relation to the attacks on the remote beach on the SA Coorong in February last year.
