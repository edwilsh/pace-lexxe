Carlton has been fined over a rules breach

CARLTON has been hit with a $2500 fine for failing to update the AFL on the whereabouts of a player.

The Blues didn't tell the League an unwell player would miss a recent training session, which is a requirement under AFL rules.

No drug tests were missed as a result of the unexpected absence of the player, but the club has still been penalised for not disclosing he wouldn't be available.

An AFL statement said the Blues were officially sanctioned for "the failure to provide complete up-to-date whereabouts information at all times for testing purposes".

The Blues have been approached for comment.
