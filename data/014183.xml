  <title>Multi-million dollar funding brings in jobs</title>
  <content>
THE $6.5 million in Federal Government funding for the C.ex Coffs International Stadium will deliver more than a boosted number of seats.
"This project will create 62 jobs in construction and 41 ongoing jobs in the area, which is an added benefit of having a high quality sporting arena in our backyard," Nationals Member for Cowper Luke Hartsuyker said.
"Improved facilities bring more and higher profile events to our region which fills rooms in local hotels and motels throughout the year.
"This increase in tourism dollars flowing into Coffs Harbour and the surrounding areas will have a flow-on effect into other areas of our local economy."
The $13.4 million upgrade will add close to three times the amount of seating.
"Benefits of this funding include almost 2000 additional seats which will increase the total seating capacity to 2900," Mr Hartsuyker said.
On top of the extra seating and carparks, additional facilities includes:

Two change rooms
Two coaches boxes
Four media boxes
16 female and 14 male toilets
Two unisex accessible toilets
Two bars and two kiosks
Two player dugouts
Rain water harvesting and solar energy
Six event rooms
Six roof mounted camera points
