  <title>Gold explorers set for solid earnings, despite strong Aussie</title>
  <content>
As geopolitics continues to shock like never before, safe haven assets such as gold remain a draw for investors, with cost-efficient Australian producers headed for a solid reporting season.

The precious metal has indicated moderate signs of life and is currently fetching $US1269 an ounce ($1594 an ounce) after the US Federal Reserve left its benchmark policy unchanged last week.
"While legislative, security, and economic risks abound, none of these risks have yet to truly materialise into a risk-off, gold positive event," says Christopher Louney, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
"The market certainly has gotten used to uncertainty and the high level of geopolitical risk, thus leaving gold to trade against the dollar, equities, rates, etc."
But Australian gold producers are set for a solid reporting season, say experts; the dramatic mining downturn having forced companies to streamline exploration processes and some recent small cap discoveries piquing the interest of the market.

"Generally, Australian gold miners have done remarkably well to take costs out and take advantage of the gold price in Australian dollar terms," says Victor Gomes, co-portfolio manager of UBS' small cap fund.
"And you would have thought that gold would have lifted, with rising interest rates in the United States and the winding back of quantitative easing, you would have thought it would have peeled off in US dollar terms."

However, the influence of the fluctuating exchange rates will continue to influence investor sentiment towards gold.
"Many local currency gold prices are doing less well," says Ben Crowley, gold analyst at Macquarie Wealth Management in a note to clients. "This suggests gold's underlying strength is not all that."
But regardless of the price, smaller cap miners are exploring again and larger fund managers are taking notice.
BlackRock - the world's largest asset manager - has taken , currently drilling in Mali, West Africa. BlackRock picked up the majority of its 24.9 million shares at 0.24Â¢.

The majors are interested in the potential of the early-stage Cascabel project in Ecuador, which analysts have compared to some of the largest existing copper and gold mines, including Rio Tinto's Oyu Tolgoi project.
