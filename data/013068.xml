  <title>Swans lose skipper, Deledio set for GWS</title>
  <content>
SYDNEY has lost skipper Josh Kennedy to a hamstring injury but has been boosted by an influx of talent for tonight's critical clash with Geelong at Simonds Stadium.
Kurt Tippett has been named for just his sixth game this season along with Sam Reid, Gary Rohan and Jake Lloyd.
Tippett hasn't played since the Round 10 loss to Hawthorn and comes into the team for ruckman Sam Naismith who failed to recover from an abdominal injury picked up last week.
ROUND 20:
HOMETOWN:
FIRST GAME:
"With Naismith going out of the team it means Kurt is another marking target for us in the forward half and Sam (Reid) provides plenty of versatility," Swans coach John Longmire said.
Lloyd and Rohan were both late withdrawals from the team which lost to the Hawks at the MCG last Friday night but have recovered from their respective injuries.
"They've both trained really well this week and have finished off at our main session on Wednesday," Longmire said.

"Jake is a very important player for us. He's had a fantastically consistent year and has held his for the whole season."
Longmire indicated Kennedy is likely to miss just the one week with a minor hamstring injury.
"He was able to run around on Wednesday but not get up to full pace so the risk was too great," Longmire said.
"We'll see how he goes at training next week."
Dan Robinson and Jordan Foote have both been dropped.
Across town the Giants have some very big names in themselves for their crunch game with Melbourne in Canberra with Brett Deledio named for his first game as a GWS player. Jacob Hopper is also in for his first game since Round 7 after re-injuring his ankle mid-season.
"Jacob impressed in the NEAFL last week," Giants coach Leon Cameron said.
"His game time was slightly limited but his output was where we know it can be when he's playing his best."
Experienced pair Shane Mumford (ankle) and Steve Johnson (knee) are also back from injury.
"It's great to have Mummy back in," Cameron said.
"He's such a physical presence for us but Dawson is really unlucky to go out of the side, he couldn't have done much more last week. Stevie had last week off and trained really well on Wednesday so it's great to have him back in the side."
Jeremy Cameron is out for at least three weeks with a hamstring and Will Setterfield will miss with concussion while Simpson and Harry Perryman have both been omitted.
