  <title>More funding for SA schools after NAPLAN</title>
  <content>
South Australian schools will receive a $67 million funding increase following poor NAPLAN results.
The extra funding will go towards measures, such as employing more teachers, to help lift literacy and numeracy levels, state Education Minister Susan Close said in a statement on Wednesday.
SA ranked below the national average in the reading and writing component of the nationwide test.
