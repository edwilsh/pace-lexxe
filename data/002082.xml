  <title>Missing kayaker: Search for Japanese baker Junichi Yoshimura 'a recovery operation'</title>
  <content>
A kayaker missing for five days in the freezing waters of Port Phillip Bay is likely to be dead and his body may never be found, Victoria water police say.

A paddle was tethered to the kayak, Sergeant Louis du Plessis told Fairfax Media.
It was still not known if Mr Yoshimura was wearing a life jacket, or how well he could swim, but Sergeant du Plessis said "any person in any type of clothing would not last more than a day" in the conditions.Photo: Supplied
"We are looking for a deceased male at this stage," he said.
Mr Yoshimura, 41, has been working as a baker at Torquay's Zeally Bay Sourdough since arriving in Australia in November.

He went missing after launching his kayak from an Altona boat ramp about 5am on Thursday.

Work colleagues raised the alarm when Mr Yoshimura failed to arrive for work on Friday.
They later found his car at the boat ramp.
Saturday's search was hampered by the extreme weather, as wind gusts topped 50 knots in the bay.
The search was scaled back at nightfall on Sunday, but revived after a police helicopter found the kayak across the bay near Edithvale on Monday morning.
Sergeant du Plessis said divers would not join the search unless there was an indication of where Mr Yoshimura left the kayak. 
There was a "good chance" his body would never be found, he said.
Mr Yoshimura's family is due to arrive in Australia from Japan on Tuesday.
They have been notified of the discovery of the kayak through the Japanese consulate.
Zeally Bay Sourdough baker owner Joel Farnan said news of the kayak's discovery was devastating.
"We thought we were prepared for something like this, but this is when the reality starts to set in," he told Fairfax Media.
Mr Farnan said Mr Yoshimura was a highly skilled baker, who trained in France before joining his team on a skilled migrant visa at the start of 2017.
His skills and knowledge in the small, tight-knit business - where employees regularly work side by side - were already being missed.
Mr Farnan and his family had spent time in Japan with Mr Yoshimura before he moved to Australia.
He described him as "amazingly generous", passionate and very dedicated to his work.
A keen fisherman, Mr Yoshimura often went on expeditions after buying his distinctive '2 Monks' kayak.
"He got his car and then shortly afterwards bought a kayak and often he'd go on these expeditions and come back with fish and share them around the bakery," Mr Farnan said.
"He's really into fishing, it's one of his passions."
Mr Yoshimura had kayaked at Altona a number of times, and also went on expeditions at Port Fairy and Lake Eildon.
Mr Farnan - also a kayaker - said he didn't know whether he was aware of the danger of Port Phillip Bay, but workmates had regularly discussed safety requirements.
"As far as his skills on the ocean I have absolutely no idea," he said. "[But] the bay is treacherous at the best of times."
