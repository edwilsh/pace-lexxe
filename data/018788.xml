KIDS of all ages were in Wollongong on Tuesday to see Hogwarts Castle, Jurassic Park and Star Wars - all in Lego of course.

Following the success of the inaugural Toy Brick Fair last year, Casey's Toys and Wollongong Central have again joined forces to bring the magic of the little building blocks back.

The exhibition features 100 unique displays and models built from more than 500,000 toy bricks.

THE FORCE: Lego enthusiasts looking at the Star Wars creations at the Toy Brick Fair.
Wollongong Central General Manager Dennis Price said the fair had proven to be just as popular with the big kids.

Children can also play at the Lego tables, guess how many Lego pieces are in the giant bowl and take part in a selection of activities with prizes on offer.
The will run until Sunday, January 17 in Wollongong Central Keira Building, lower ground, near Coles.

ALL ABOARD: A Lego train circles a miniature city scene at the Toy Brick Fair.
Tickets are $5 per person (2 years and under free) and can be purchased on the day.

It's open weekdays from 9.30am to 5pm, Saturdays 9.30am to 4pm and Sundays 10am to 4pm.
