  <title>Half a century caring for land down the drain</title>
  <content>
A TENNYSON resident who has spent thousands of dollars of her own money and volunteered countless hours caring for public land next door for the past 48 years is heartbroken Charles Sturt Council has put it up for sale.
Valerie Poole says the council did not consult her or her family before putting the Seaview Rd block on the market despite the fact that she and her late husband, James Poole, had cared for the property for almost half a century.
They have planted about 25 trees on the 711sq m property, installed $10,000 worth of pipes and a sprinkler system and even paid for regular visits from a professional gardener.
The block -  - is valued at $1.3 million.
Mrs Poole, 70, said she had asked to buy the land from the council three times over the years but they had all been refused.
She said she had endured "appalling treatment" from the council, which left a note in her mailbox in December, after the decision to sell the land had already been made, informing her of the upcoming sale.
Mrs Poole's daughter was refused the opportunity to address the council on her behalf after it was officially announced.
"I suspect they already have a buyer, which gives me no opportunity at all," Mrs Poole said.
"I've spent my entire adult life looking out on the beautiful greenery and the birds and I want to see it stay green.
"It absolutely stinks, it is on a dangerous corner and it has never ever been a building block.
"It hurts when I planted all those trees - do they think I've got no feelings?
"If they are allowed to sell it, it will be an absolute nightmare for residents and they shouldn't be allowed to get away with it."
Mrs Poole said she had been so stressed by the situation that she hadn't been sleeping.
Kerry Aitken, who lives a few doors down on Seaview Rd, backed Mrs Poole's concerns.
"The council haven't been very kind to her (Valerie)," Mrs Aitken said.
"We are just up in arms about it because we feel they (the council) can do what they want and there seems to be no avenues for anyone to have any say about anything.
"When you do, you end up having to engage solicitors.
"They (the council) tell you about what they are going to do after they have already made the decision."
Charles Sturt Council chief executive Paul Sutton said the land had been approved for sale in December but he would not elaborate on why it was being sold now given the council has owned it since 1971.
"Legal advice has indicated we are able to sell and it is valued at $1.3 million," Mr Sutton said. "Following approval from (the) council, we formally notified the neighbours that the land was to be sold."
Mr Sutton did not answer how or when the residents were informed or if the council had a buyer.
He also would not comment about whether the neighbours were given an opportunity to address the council or if Mrs Poole should have been given the first opportunity to purchase the land.
