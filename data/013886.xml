  <title>Dukes of Hazzard star on assault charges</title>
  <content>
The actor who played Luke on the 1980s television show The Dukes of Hazzard has been charged in Massachusetts with groping a female member of the cast of a musical he was supposed to appear in.
Tom Wopat pleaded not guilty on Thursday to indecent assault and battery and drug charges.
He was released on $US1000 ($A1250) bail and told to stay away from the woman. He refused to comment outside court.
Waltham police arrested the 65-year-old Wopat about 11pm on Wednesday. Police say during a search of his vehicle they found a white powder believed to be cocaine.
Wopat was supposed to play Julian Marsh in 42nd Street at the Waltham-based Reagle Music Theatre of Greater Boston, but the theatre announced on Thursday that a different actor would play the role.
