  <title>Push to change way we are charged for water</title>
  <content>
SOUTHEAST Queenslanders are facing higher, fixed water bills because they are not using enough liquid gold.

Seqwater has asked for water to be charged like electricity under a total overhaul of the way it bills households.

It comes as the utility admits a revenue shortfall of $163 million following warnings it cannot properly service its debt at current prices.

The massive hole in earnings has been blamed on waterwise residents turning off the tap, with a forecast of a 185 litres per person per day by 2017-18 not eventuating.
