MELBOURNE Storm star Cooper Cronk is juggling his property portfolio as he prepares to leave Melbourne for Sydney.
The two-time Dally M Medallist has listed his Calamvale Queensland investment house.
Any Calamvale sale will not leave him without property in Queensland, having recently settled on an off the plan Mount Gravatt apartment.
Cronk recently settled on the 2016 purchase in the blue chip Brisbane suburb, which cost $472,500.

The redundant Calamvale offering cost Cronk $477,000 in 2007. It was bought new just days after thumping Manly in the Grand Final, one of the two Grand Final wins that were chalked off the Storm's achievements due to salary cap breaches.
Located on the south side of Brisbane, the four bedroom home has become redundant after his mother, Wendy left to live elsewhere. .
The modern family home on an elevated 510 sqm parcel has an open kitchen and dining space that flows to an outdoor entertaining area adjoining the back garden.
Harcourts Calamvale agent Hong Chau is seeking offers above $639,000.

For sale.

Cronk shocked the NRL by announcing he was moving to the Harbour City to be with his Fox Sports fiancee Tara Rushton.
The 33-year-old Melbourne Storm halfback proposed to Rushton over the Christmas/New Year break.
Rushton has been based in Kirribilli since 2014 when she paid $780,000 for a two-bedroom apartment in an Art Deco block.
The Brisbane-born Cronk has spent his career at the Storm following his NRL debut in 2004.
Despite living 900km apart the couple have made the long distance relationship work.
Collecting his second Dally M Medal last year, Cronk credited his happiness off field for his stellar year on the field.
"There's no doubt she's brought a lot of joy and positivity off the field and that translates on the field," Cronk said.
Cronk, who will be at the club in a coaching role, maintains a Richmond townhouse which cost $570,000 in 2006.
