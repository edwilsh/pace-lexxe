  <title>Volkswagen Adds New Entry-Spec Amarok V6</title>
  <content>
Australia has lowered the price of entry to its Amarok V6 range, adding a new Sportline variant as the starting point to the brand's flagship diesel V6 ute.
The new model undercuts the existing Highline and Ultimate model by a considerable $4500 and $12,500 respectively with a price of $55,490 plus on-road costs, putting it within reach of buyers who might otherwise have considered less powerful utes like the  or .
In order to keep the price down the Sportline goes without some of the features of the more highly specified models, but still comes with an Apple CarPlay and Android Auto-compatible 6.3-inch touchscreen, 18-inch alloy wheels, four-wheel disc brakes, front and rear park sensors, a reversing camera, and four USB sockets.

Mechanical specification stays the same, with a 3.0-litre turbo diesel V6 producing 165kW and 550Nm (with a 180kW overboost function) matched to an eight-speed automatic transmission and permanent four wheel drive. A six-speed manual version will be added from 2018.
Volkswagen has made no change to the safety specifications of the new variant, meaning the Sportline, like all other Amarok models goes without rear curtain airbags.
Volkswagen has yet to release images of the Amarok Sportline, Amarok Core Plus shown.
