Top White House officials including one tasked with cyber security have been caught out by a British-based email prankster posing as members of President Donald Trump's inner circle.
The White House admitted a number of officials had responded to emails from the prankster and said it was investigating.
The prankster reportedly shared the email exchanges with CNN, which identified Tom Bossert, Mr Trump's homeland security adviser, as one of the officials who fell for the prank.
Mr Bossert apparently responded, believing he was corresponding with Jared Kushner, Mr Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, and included a personal email address in his reply.
CNN said the email from a fake Jared Kushner Outlook account said: "Tom, we are arranging a bit of a soiree towards the end of August.
"It would be great if you could make it, I promise food of at least comparible [sic] quality to that which we ate in Iraq. Should be a great evening."
Mr Bossert replied: "Thanks, Jared. With a promise like that, I can't refuse. Also, if you ever need it, my personal email is (redacted)."

The network said Anthony Scaramucci, , also responded to the prankster who pretended to be Reince Priebus.
The two have a contentious relationship and , days before Mr Scaramucci was forced out.
Others identified by CNN are Jon Huntsman, Mr Trump's nominee to be the US ambassador to Russia and Eric Trump, one of the president's sons.
Mr Trump said he recognised the email as a "sham" and turned it over to the US Secret Service.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it takes cyber-related issues seriously and is looking into the incidents.
The Secret Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
