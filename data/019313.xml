  <title>Qld tow-truck driver fees to be capped.</title>
  <content>
Queensland tow-truck drivers will need special licences and won't be able to charge more than $250 to tow vehicles from private property under a proposal to be considered by the state government.
An investigation headed by former District Court Judge Michael Forde into dodgy practices among tow-truck operators has recommended the new licences and the cap on fees, along with penalties for those who break the rules.
Acting Main Roads Minister Steven Miles will take the recommendations to state cabinet on Monday.
