  <title>Search after Queensland military helicopter crash</title>
  <content>
A search is under way after a US military helicopter crashed off the coast of Queensland.
The aircraft, an MV-22 Osprey, is believed to have crashed on Saturday afternoon, with several of those on board unaccounted for.
Other military aircraft and ships have been sent to the area, where they are combing the water for any sign of the missing service members.
In a statement, the US Marine Corps Public Affairs Office said there had been a "mishap".
"The United States Marine Corps confirms there is an active search and rescue mission ongoing for service members involved in an MV-22 mishap off the east coast of Australia," the statement said.
"Ships, small boats and aircraft from the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit and Bonhomme Richard Expeditionary Strike Group are conducting the search and rescue operations.
"We will provide more details as they become available."
US forces were in Australia for Talisman Saber, a joint military training exercise involving a combined 33,000 troops, which is held each two years.
