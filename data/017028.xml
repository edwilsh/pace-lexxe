  <title>Stand-off over Sydney homeless tent city</title>
  <content>
Sydney City Council and the NSW government are at loggerheads over a tent city in Martin Place while the state's top cop wants the matter settled by Monday.
Police Commissioner Mick Fuller and Social Housing Minister Pru Goward urged Lord Mayor Clover Moore to resolve the issue after a meeting at Sydney Town Hall on Friday.
The council has the power to remove the property of those sleeping in the thoroughfare but Ms Moore says they won't be moved on until she's assured there's a long-term housing solution and a list of demands are met.
They include the government re-opening Sydney's most famous social housing project - the Sirius building
Ms Moore also wants a 24/7 safe space in the CBD to provide food and services to the homeless, funding for social housing units and approval to extend Sydney's affordable housing levy.
Until then she says police and the government are welcome to use their own powers to move the tent city.
