Mitch Cullen remembers his parents watching his first grade debut in 2010 but when the Kurri Kurri five-eighth notches up game 100 on Sunday the 25-year-old will be surrounded by his own family. 

The Bulldogs junior, who has played "every position except prop" across eight seasons, will have partner Hannah and one-year-old son Oakland on the sidelines to mark the milestone as well as the extended family clan.  

"They'll all be there," Cullen said. "It was only really mum and dad there for my debut, now I've got a whole family of my own."

The 2013 grand finalist said seventh-placed Kurri, who must beat Central at St John Oval to have any chance of returning to the semis, were in a "rebuilding stage".  
Meanwhile, Bulldogs secretary Jeff Polglase said the club were "reviewing" the performance of current coach Ron Griffiths to decide whether they will extend his one-year contract or employ a third mentor at Kurri in as many seasons.
