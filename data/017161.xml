  <title>SC2067: Spirit of the region to drive employment</title>
  <content>
THE Coast's holistic, rejuvenating qualities will shape its people and their jobs 50 years from now, according to the region's chamber of commerce president.
Michael Shadforth heads the Sunshine Coast Chamber of Commerce Alliance and is managing director of Ray White Commercial in Mooloolaba.
"The Coast will really come to grips with understanding how to get the best out of a person," Mr Shadforth said.
"I think in the next 50 years it will be really focused around health and well being.
"It'll be active longevity, both mentally and physically."
He said a reasonably high sense of spirituality would come with that.
"People will come here to rejuvenate in terms of their aspirations for life."
He said the Coast was already giving people what they wanted in life so they could be the best they could be.
"When you think about industry, we don't even know what the industries are going to look like.
But he said the people in those industries would have to be talented and be nourished by more things than just what they ate and drank.
"They have got to be nourished so holistically in their environment they will want to do that because there is no need to be anchored to a location because of your job any more.
"If we start to shine in those areas we will be a phenomena."
Mr Shadforth said a lot of industries would revolve around the premise "how do I leave the place in a better way than I got it"?
"I don't think it will be heavily based in finance, I don't think it will be heavily based in corporate marketing, I don't think it will be heavily based in massive engineering, I don't think it will be heavily based in anything to do in and around that artificial style of stimuli.
"It will be very grounded in the natural aspects."
He said companies would come to the Coast from around the world to work out how to get the best from their people.
"Here that level of technology around how to sustain being a better you every time you come back is going to be pushed up another level."
He said the region's airport would bring opportunity for niche agriculture products like pineapples, macadamia nuts and avocados to be supplied to Asia's middle class.
The way core services like education and health were delivered would also have a unique appeal.
"The treatment of symptoms will also be something that's done slightly differently here in 50 years than it would be done in New York or Hong Kong or Beijing.
"Here will have that one or two per cent point of difference where we are really trying to make sure that it's connected to the country and the land which we offer.
"I think that becomes a really strong niche."
Advances in technology would also change the way people fulfilled their needs.
"I don't know if people are going to need libraries in their own home any more, let alone state libraries," Mr Shadforth said.
"Our tablets are going to supply us with anything that we could have wanted to read or appreciate.
"You could have the Mona Lisa framed in high definition.
"You could probably get to a point where you can actually touch the paint if you wanted to."
Mr Shadforth said people shouldn't fear compression of living space as the population grew.
"I think urban sprawl is what kills society."
He referenced the new CBD project in Maroochydore.
"I think you'll find in the next 15 years that a lot of people will go 'oh no I prefer to live in there'.
He said the safety, proximity to other people and easy access to amenities would appeal.
"I think the people who come to the Sunshine Coast, as long as we are branded correctly, will be people that... care about putting it into a better position than in which they got it.
"That'll be what drives us.
"The population that comes here wants the narrative about who we are and how connected we are with our country and what it offers us."
Mr Shadforth said animal species would enjoy a resurgence in numbers.
"In 50 years you will be able to find a platypus any weekend you want.
"You will be able to find echidnas and koala bears in every national park on the Sunshine Coast.
"You will be able to take your kids fishing off a pier and they will be able to catch a fish good enough to eat for dinner.
"They will also understand that there's no need to rape and pillage that."
He said the attraction of creative entrepreneurs and compression of living would bring more artists to the Coast.
"I think we will get a very creative bunch of entrepreneurs that are stimulated by the next tier (of artist) up from them.
"When those people (artists) find that they can put a really avant garde type of show on and the Sunshine Coast audience appears, that is when we will start to see that."
He said property prices probably discouraged a lot of artists from the area.
"The scary part for me is the people that make it groovy will find it difficult to live here unless we get some compression.
"The rock star or the group that plays live music around the place- they can't come here because they can't afford to live here."
He said Sydney or other large cities held greater appeal.
"They cram into a little units and can find work spasmodically and still take a week off to work in a studio.
"When people talk about that sort of (compressed) housing they forget that it's for the cool, for the artists, for the people that make the vibe.
"You can't all live in a $2 million house and be cool.
"It doesn't happen."
"The Sunshine Coast is different. It has its own personality."
