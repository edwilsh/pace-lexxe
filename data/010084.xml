  <title>Mirabella defamation case back in court</title>
  <content>
Former Liberal MP Sophie Mirabella's defamation case against a regional Victorian newspaper and its editor is due back in a Melbourne court.
Ms Mirabella is suing weekly newspaper The Benalla Ensign and its editor Libby Price in the Victoria County Court over an April 2016 article about an encounter with member for Indi, Cathy McGowan.
An application for the case is listed for Thursday.
Ms Mirabella, who lost the seat to Ms McGowan in 2013, says the article is defamatory because it said "Mirabella had physically pushed Cathy Magowan (sic) out of the way of a photograph for her own political reasons", according to a writ filed on April 19.
Ms Mirabella alleges the newspaper knew the pushing allegations would be damaging to her reputation and election campaign, but they published the "unsubstantiated" story anyway.
The former Indi MP says a day after the article was published on April 20, 2016, her office confirmed to other media outlets no physical contact had taken place.
But the newspaper only acknowledged their "mistake" and withdrew the allegations in October 2016, well after the federal election, Ms Mirabella says in her writ.
