  <title>Retailer awarded for fruits of good labour</title>
  <content>
WORKING in retail is not an easy career, but for the past 24 years Roz White has embraced the challenge and strived to make a difference in the community.
In recognition of her hard work and many achievements, she has been officially inducted into the Independent Grocers of Australia (IGA) Hall of Fame.
Mrs White, with the help of her husband Michael, runs four IGA stores across the Sunshine Coast - at Bli Bli, Peregian Springs, Mooloolah and Mt Coolum.
Mrs White said she was overwhelmed and honoured to be recognised for her contributions to the industry.
"Michael and I began our retail journey in 1993 and, together with our 250 team members, attribute our community involvement as key to our success," MrsWhite said.
"From working with community groups, through to our 'locavore' philosophy promoting local farmers and producers from Queensland, the Sunshine Coast and Australia.
"Strong family values were instilled in me from an early age working on my parents' farm," she explained, "and today I remain hugely passionate and dedicated to supporting our community.
"I am very proud of the Whites IGA team for also being recognised at the awards with the 2017 IGA National Community Award, which has only been possible with the support of our community."
