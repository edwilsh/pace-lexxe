SHAUN Weiss, best known for playing Goldberg in Mighty Ducks, has been sentenced to 150 days in LA County Jail.
Weiss, 38, reportedly stole $US151 worth of merchandise from Fry's Electronics earlier this month. According to , this is the second time he's been busted for petty theft.
Weiss' manager confirmed to Page Six that the actor began his sentence last Friday.
"Hopefully when he gets out he will go to rehab so he can stay sober," the rep told us, adding that Weiss hopes to write while he's serving his time.
Weiss appeared in Heavyweights, Freaks and Geeks, The King of Queens and The Tony Danza Show.
