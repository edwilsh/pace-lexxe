  <title>Trump signs 'flawed' Russian sanctions</title>
  <content>
WHITE House officials say US President Donald Trump has signed a bill to impose new sanctions on Russia.
Two White House officials said that the president signed the bill on Wednesday morning Washington DC time.
The package of stiff financial sanctions against Russia passed Congress with overwhelming support.
It was in response to information that Russia meddled in the US elections, however it has denied doing so.
Moscow responded to the sanctions by ordering a reduction in the number of US diplomats in Russia.
The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly before an official statement.
