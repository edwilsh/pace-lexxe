POLICE had no choice but to shoot dead a radicalised Melbourne teenager who attacked officers with a knife, a coroner has found.
Numan Haider, 18, died instantly when he was shot in the head on September 23, 2014 after stabbing two counter-terrorism officers who had arranged to meet him outside Endeavour Hills police station.
"There was no time or opportunity for the officers to use a lower force to prevent further injuries," Victorian coroner John Olle said in his findings on Monday.
