THE options are endless for Darwinites wanting to build, with home and land packages available for every taste, location, and budget.
From the northern suburbs to Palmerston and even Berry Springs, building from scratch is a way for a family to stamp their own footprint.
In Muirhead, developers have blocks of land that are ten times bigger than your average Sydney lot and 90 per cent cheaper per sq m.
Jacqueline O'Reilly and Shaun Gill have built their home on a 4000sq m lot at Muirhead.
The four-bedroom home has more than 500sq m of living space with three bathrooms and a media room.
The big back veranda overlooks a spacious backyard with a pool, and room for their sons Joseph, 10, and Jacob, 8, to play rugby and cricket.
"This is our forever home," Ms O'Reilly said.
"We designed the house ourselves because Jacob has special needs, so we knew we would be creating our whole life here.
"We couldn't afford to do it in somewhere like Sydney or Melbourne."
Muirhead's average price of $160 persq m compares to a mean of $1152 in Sydney, $592 in Melbourne, and $551 in South East Queensland, according to the UDIA's 2017 State of the Land Report.
Berrimah's Northcrest development is now a hub of activity with the first stage of construction to be completed by November 2017.
Northcrest's Shane Dignan said the Berrimah development would become home to up to 7500 Territorians and include the development of 2000 housing and medium density development sites as well as business, commercial and community activities.
"This project will be developed over the next 10 to 13 years, providing a major economic stimulus to Darwin, creating up to 3200 local employment opportunities," he said.
Northcrest's prices start at $263,000 and range in size from 474sq m to 770sq m.
In June, new land was released at the Healey Release at The Heights, Durack, with 12 blocks ranging from 302sq m to 446sq m.
The development will eventually be home to more than 800 families.
