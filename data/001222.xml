  <title>Elderly Vic woman shaken by home theft</title>
  <content>
A thief has broken into the regional Victorian home of a 96-year-old war widow and stolen her late husband's war medals.
The woman woke at midnight on Sunday in her Kyabram home of 62 years and discovered it had been ransacked.
A small amount of cash was missing and her husband's replica war medals and air force log books were gone.
Police say the woman was very distressed by the theft and they are urging anyone who sees the stolen medals to make contact.
