  <title>Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in war of words with WA Premier over GST carve-up</title>
  <content>
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has become embroiled in an escalating war of words with WA Premier Mark McGowan, setting the stage for a fiery showdown when the two meet privately tonight to discuss the state's GST allocation.
After Mr Turnbull told Mr McGowan to "show some steel in his spine", the Premier responded angrily and said the Prime Minister should "stop acting like Tony Abbott" and making excuses for WA's lack of GST revenue.
The GST issue has dominated Mr Turnbull's week-long trip to the west, after it was revealed WA's already low share of revenue could fall by a further $2 billion over four years due to changes in population estimates.
The WA Government has urged the Commonwealth to intervene, but .
Asked about tonight's meeting during his visit to Albany this morning, Mr Turnbull challenged Mr McGowan to more forcefully stand up to his Labor colleagues around the country and convince them of the merits of GST reform.
"This is a time to see how courageous he is and how prepared he is to stand up for the west," Mr Turnbull said.
"He's got to be prepared to stand up for Western Australia within the Labor Party.
"He can't just be somebody that wants to get someone else to do all his advocacy and fighting for him."
Listening or lecturing tour?

But those comments drew an angry response from Mr McGowan, who said the Prime Minister was making "ridiculous" excuses and "misleading West Australians".
"For what was dubbed as a listening tour, it seems the Prime Minister is more interested in lecturing West Australians," Mr McGowan said.
"Don't act like Tony Abbott and start listening to the people of Western Australia."
Mr McGowan predicted his discussion with Mr Turnbull tonight would be "friendly but forceful", saying the meeting would focus around the predicted $2 billion hit to WA's GST revenue that was revealed this week.
A showdown over the GST this evening could make for an awkward situation tomorrow morning, when Mr Turnbull and Mr McGowan will front the media together to open a new section of freeway in Perth's north.
There has been speculation the pair could announce a "city deal" tomorrow, as a mechanism to boost infrastructure funding for Perth, but Mr McGowan indicated those negotiations were a long way from a resolution.
"If it is just a pic opp, I'm not particularly interested," Mr McGowan said.
The Commonwealth has already signed city deals covering Launceston and Townsville, arrangements that guaranteed money for key infrastructure projects in those locations.
A city deal has been raised as a potential source of federal money for the rest of the WA Government's proposed Metronet public transport system, after part of those plans were funded using dollars previously set aside for the Perth Freight Link.
