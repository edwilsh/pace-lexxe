  <title>Adelaide Crows unperturbed by uncertainty over defender Jake Lever's future</title>
  <content>
Adelaide's chief executive says he's unfazed by reports of sought-after defender Jake Lever meeting with rival clubs.
Lever, who falls off-contract with the Crows at the end of the season, has reportedly met with Melbourne, while Hawthorn and the Western Bulldogs are among other bidding clubs.

It's all about the six pointers; Hannebery through traffic kicks a ripper, Coniglio has a claim to GOTY in Canberra, McDonald-Tipungwuti nutmegs Petrevski-Seton at the G, Billings clutch kick against West Coast and Eddie Betts is back from surgery to work his usual magic from the pocket.

"I actually expect that players might, from time to time, meet [rivals] and whether Jake has or not is kind of a bit irrelevant," Andrew Fagan told reporters on Monday.
"We always assume that people will go through a really thorough decision making process and engage with their families ... and other football clubs. That is actually to be expected."

Lever's teammate Mitch McGovern is also weighing up his future amid offers from clubs in his home town Perth.
Some reports suggest the Crows' offers to the duo are falling short by as much as $300,000 a season compared to the multi-year deals from rivals.

"What I can assure our supporters is, a lot of what they read and hear is inaccurate in terms of numbers and figures and all the rest of it," Fagan said.

"I know it's tough for the fans and I empathise with them but the club is is doing all that it can, and the players will go through their process."
Adelaide forward Charlie Cameron has also been linked to clubs in Queensland, where his family live.
"The truth of the matter is it really doesn't help the situation by providing running commentary on negotiations," Fagan said.
"And I think people understand that. We have made it clear to our fans ... we are doing every possible to ensure that we maintain a competitive and healthy list, not just for this year but into the future."
