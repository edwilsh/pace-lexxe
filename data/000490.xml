  <title>Man pleads not guilty over road rage death</title>
  <content>
A MAN accused of killing a fellow motorist during a roadside altercation has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter.
Tamate Henry Heke, 38, is facing day one of a Brisbane Supreme Court trial today over the incident on December 1, 2015.
Shane Merrigan, 50, died after the alleged altercation on the Gateway Motorway.
Heke, originally from New Zealand, has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and an alternative charge of unlawful striking causing death.
A jury is now being selected.
Police have alleged Heke got into a dispute with the victim over a traffic incident on the Gateway Motorway at Eight Mile Plains before Mr Merrigan was hit by a truck.
More to come.
