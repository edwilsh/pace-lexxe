Laurie Oakes has announced his retirement, bringing to an end a 50-year career in journalism. 
The Nine Network's political editor, who is nearing his 74th birthday, announced he was retiring on Wednesday afternoon. 
The veteran journalist's career has outlasted 14 Australian prime ministers. He is perhaps best known for reading then-treasurer John Howard's budget speech live on television in 1980 - a day before the budget was due to be handed down.
Oakes' last day on air with Nine News will be Friday August 18.
