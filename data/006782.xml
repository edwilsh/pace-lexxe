  <title>Video released in probe of Sydney fires</title>
  <content>
NSW police have released dramatic security footage in their appeal for information about two suspicious fires at a function centre in Sydney's west.
The first fire was put out quickly early on Boxing Day 2016 but it caused major smoke damage at the Bankstown centre, police say.
A second blaze on January 3 caused major damage to the building.
The CCTV video shows two people appearing to pour fuel around the centre's interior and flames engulfing the floor.
It also shows an XR model Ford utility seen in the area about the time of the fire.
Detectives want to speak to anyone who recognises the people or the ute.
