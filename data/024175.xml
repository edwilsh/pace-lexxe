  <title>New route flies Adelaide-Hobart</title>
  <content>
JETSTAR will offer passengers the chance to fly direct from Adelaide to Hobart, starting later this year.
Up to 55,000 people are expected to travel annually on the new route, which will operate three times per week starting from November 14.
Jetstar Group Chief Commercial Officer Catriona Larritt said the service was the first to fly direct between the two cities.
"Thousands of travellers already travel from Adelaide to Hobart via Melbourne, so we are excited to offer direct low-fares between the two cities, making it even easier to travel," she said.
"Both Adelaide and Hobart are experiencing record tourism numbers, and we expect inbound tourism to the two cities to further strengthen with the addition of our new flights."
