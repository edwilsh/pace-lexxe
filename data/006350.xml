  <content>
A four-car crash in Sydney's west has left a man and a woman in hospital.
Police and emergency services were called Mount Vernon just before 9pm on Tuesday after a Mazda 3 and a Mitusbishi Lancer collided head-on, while another two cars were also involved in the crash.
The 23-year-old female driver of the Mazda is in a stable condition in hospital with cuts to her heads and chest, while the 21-year-old man driving the Mitsubishi Lancer suffered fractured legs and hips and is also in hospital.
Both drivers of the other two cars, aged 24 and 25, suffered shock and minor injuries.
