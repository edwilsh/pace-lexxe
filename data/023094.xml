  <title>Canberra Times sport podcast: Raiders circling finals berth after Shark attack</title>
  <content>
With a stunning win over the reigning premiers, the Canberra Raiders have kept their finals hopes alive for another week with their next test across the Ditch.

Can they knock off the New Zealand warriors in Auckland to continue the run and which two games shape as the crucial deciders in their quest?
The Wallabies continue to look more and more like the Wallatahs every day as Australia coach Michael Cheika makes the astounding revelation that 2017 Super Rugby form is irrelevant, but 2014 form is relevant following the omission of ACT Brumbies captain Sam Carter.
Greater Western Sydney begin their charge to the AFL premiership with a resounding win in their third-and-final game at Manuka Oval for the season, while Canberra's Josh Bruce and Jack Steele continue to shine as St Kilda tries to force their way into the eight.
We'll also discuss Canberra' answer to Serena Williams, the Caulfield Cup and local finals.
