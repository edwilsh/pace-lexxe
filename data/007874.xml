THE wonder of Mother Nature has been captured once again in this year's National Geographic Travel Photographer Of The Year Awards.
A photograph of an erupting volcano hit by a bolt of lightning has beaten thousands of other pictures to earn the snapper the top prize,  reports.
Sergio Tapiro Velasco from Mexico took his grand prize-winning photo, titled "The Power of Nature," outside Colima, Mexico.
For more than a decade, Velasco has been studying and photographing the Volcan de Colima, which is one of the most active volcanoes in Latin America and also known as the "Volcano of Fire."

Before he captured the picture, Velasco had been carefully tracking an increase in activity and closely watched the volcano for almost a month.
While shooting on a completely clear night just 7.5 miles away from the crater, Velasco heard a booming noise and witnessed the biggest volcanic lightning he'd ever seen, but until he reviewed the photos he'd taken, Velasco had no idea if he'd actually captured the spectacular event.
He said: "When I looked on the camera display, all I could do was stare - what I was watching was impossible to conceive, the image showed those amazing forces of nature interacting on a volcano, while the lightning brightened the whole scene."
In addition to the grand-prize winner,  - Nature, Cities and People - from more than 15,000 entries from participants in more than 30 countries.
