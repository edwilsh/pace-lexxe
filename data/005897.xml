Popped shoulder benches Blakely

Connor Blakely needs shoulder surgery following his injury against the Giants

SURGERY for Fremantle pair Connor Blakely and Ed Langdon will rule them out for the rest of the season.

Blakely's left shoulder popped out twice in last Saturday's loss to Greater Western Sydney, while Langdon has been out for almost two months after suffering an injury to the posterior cruciate ligament in a knee.

High performance manager Jason Weber told fremantlefc.com.au both are expected to have full pre-seasons.

"Connor had quite a significant shoulder injury at the weekend, while Ed's PCL injury was quite significant, and he's had some challenges along the way," Weber said. 

"Both Connor and Ed will have surgery in the coming week and will miss the rest of the season."
