  <title>Mid-air cable car crash strands 100 passengers above river</title>
  <content>
One hundred passengers have been stranded above a river due to a cable car accident on a sky-way in Germany.
The gondola, which carries people across the River Rhine in Cologne, was stopped on Sunday after a car hit a pillar.
Fire crews have used a crane and a winch to rescue the stranded passengers.
Pictures posted to social media show children and adults being lowered to waiting boats, and strapped in with firefighters.
No injuries have been reported.
