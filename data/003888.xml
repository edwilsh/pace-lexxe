  <title>Late try secures GIO Cup spot for Redbank High</title>
  <content>
A TRY to back-rower Wilson Malaesilia in the final minute against Mary Mount College has secured Redbank Plains State High School a spot in the South-East Queensland schoolboy GIO Cup quarter finals.
The school side trailed 16-6 late in the second half but rallied in a display of class and commitment to win 18-16 to secure a showdown with Wavell State High at Kougari Oval on Wednesday.
Coach Nicholas Faulkner said it was a stunning comeback with five-eighth Matthew Compton-Furner having an outstanding match.
"The boys really did believe and it all came down to grit and determination," he said.
"With five minutes to go they nailed their game plan and (winger) Salvation Sila scored in the corner.
"Then with three minutes to play, our quality players got us into an attacking position."On our fourth tackle, five metres out, we were hoping and praying.
"Then there was some individual brilliance from Wilson.
"He got a pass from our hooker (Prezley Vaoiva) and scored under the posts with 30 seconds to go."
"Our players' player was Matthew Compton-Furner was our standout and had a great game defensively and directing us around the field."
Redbank Plains were second in the Gee Shield this year and lost just one game throughout.
Two Ipswich schools are in the quarter-finals with Ipswich High also taking on Marsden High on Wednesday at Kougari Oval, Wynnum.
