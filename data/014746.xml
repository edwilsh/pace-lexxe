  <title>Man smothers girl, 11, during rape bid</title>
  <content>
A New York man smothered an 11-year-old girl while trying to rape her at his rural home, police say.
A felony complaint filed in Chenango County Court accuses 36-year-old James Brower of intentionally killing Jacelyn O'Connor early on Sunday.
Brower was arraigned on a first-degree murder charge on Thursday and sent to the county jail without bail. He asked for a public defender to represent him.
He's due back in court on Tuesday.
District Attorney Joseph McBride said Jacelyn was the half sister of Brower's two sons. She lived in Morris, in neighbouring Otsego County.
State police troopers found the child dead on Sunday in Brower's home in Norwich. Brower was arrested on Tuesday.
Morris Central School is holding a vigil for Jacelyn on Monday evening.
