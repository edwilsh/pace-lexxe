  <title>Canberra man sentenced to four years' jail over drug-fuelled crime spree</title>
  <content>
A Canberra man has been sentenced to four years in jail over a drug-fuelled crime spree involving a string of burglaries in Canberra in February and March this year.
Dylan Dugdale, 25, pleaded guilty to more than 50 charges in the ACT Supreme Court.
The offences ranged from burglaries of private homes, to car theft, and breaking into the Evatt Primary School.
Justice Michael Elkaim noted the fact all the crimes were over a short period.
"This might be regarded as a crime spree, in which the offender abandoned all semblance of lawful behaviour and did his best to take property belonging to other people," he said.
One victim noted the shock and sense of violation when Dugdale robbed their house, taking their car while their children were home.
Dugdale said he was affected by drugs and had little memory of the crimes.
Justice Elkaim referred to a warning given to Dugdale by former Justice Richard Refshauge who sentenced him for earlier offences, telling him he hoped he would find something useful to do instead of burglarising people's homes.
Justice Elkaim reflected on those comments saying:
"It is obvious that the offender found nothing else useful to do.
"Although the offender is relatively young, now aged 25, he is already effectively an experienced criminal with little prospect of rehabilitation."
Justice Elkaim ordered Dugdale pay more than $5,000 in reparations to the individual victims.
But he refused to order a further reparation sought by Insurer NRMA after it was forced to make a payment to one of the victims.
Justice Elkaim said he would use his discretion to refuse the application.
"The offender is being sent to prison for a substantial time," he said.
"He will have no opportunity to make the repayments.
"His background is such that upon release the only presently predictable method of him raising the funds is by committing further burglaries."
Dugdale will be eligible for parole in 2019.
