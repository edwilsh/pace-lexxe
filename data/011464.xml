  <title>Trade surplus shrinks 58pc on lower iron ore and coal exports</title>
  <content>
Australia's trade surplus narrowed dramatically in June on the back of weaker commodity exports and the arrival of some big ticket imports.

Key points:

The trade surplus in June came in $1 billion below forecasts
Iron ore and coal exports went backwards after a big May result
Big aircraft, telecommunications and industrial equipment orders boosted imports

In seasonally adjusted terms, the surplus narrowed 58 per cent to $856 million from the revised down $2 billion recorded in May.
The market had expected a decline, but expected the surplus would come in at $1.8 billion.
Exports fell 1 per cent to $31.8 billion, while imports were up 2 per cent to $31 billion.
The value of top quality "fines" iron ore exports dropped 18 per cent, dragged down by an 10 per cent fall in price and an 8 per cent decline decline in volumes.
Coal exports were down 6 per cent after May's massive rebound from Cyclone Debbie.
The resource sector was propped up to a degree by volatile gold exports which rose by 27 per cent - or $406 million - and LNG shipments buoyed by a 6 per cent increase in both volumes and price.
Rural goods eked out a 1 per cent gain thanks largely to a 4 per cent rise in meat exports outweighing an 8 per cent fall in wool.
The import side of the ledger saw the arrival of a $400 million aircraft order and a big jump in telecommunications and industrial equipment.
More to come.
