  <title>US Open an Aussie nightmare for surfers</title>
  <content>
AUSTRALIANS Tyler Wright and Sally Fitzgibbons might be leading the world title race but when it comes to the US Open of surfing, locals rule.

The form pair of the opening rounds of the world tour event at Huntington Beach were bundled out by American surfers in shock quarter-finals losses.

The US Open has been a disaster for Australian surfers with six-time world champion Stephanie Gilmore beaten in the second round.

World champion Wright was taken down by world No. 12 Coco Ho in the final two minutes of their match-up for one of her worst results of the last two seasons.

Fitzgibbons was sent to the sand at Huntington Beach by inform California native Save Erickson.

It was a costly loss for Fitzgibbons who could have overtaken Wright in the world Championships race if she had progressed further at the event at Huntington Beach.

For the first time this season, the semi-finals will be an all-American affair with Ho meeting Tatiana Weston-Webb and Erickson up against Courtney Conlogue.
