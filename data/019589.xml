  <title>Getting careers off the ground</title>
  <content>
SHELDON College is giving students the chance to take their future careers sky high with an aviation course of a different kind.
The school has teamed up with ACE Aviation to deliver a drones program to its Year 10, 11 and 12 students.
The course, delivered by ACE Aviation chief executive and aeronautical engineer Mark Viswa Nathan and air traffic controller and air crash investigator David Wyman, gives students knowledge needed for a Certificate III in Aviation (Remote Pilot - Visual Line of Sight) - to be offered at the school in 2018.
Year 10 student Bence Major took out the prize for the highest test score and also the flight competition - landing the drone on the cross bar of the goalposts on the oval.
"We came away from the two-day course not only having greatly enjoyed ourselves, but having learnt skills and knowledge which will most likely be of great use to us in the future," he said.
