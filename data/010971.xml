  <title>[SPOILERS] 'Game of Thrones:' Who is alive (and dead) in all the major houses</title>
  <content>
While watching "Game of Thrones," do you ever catch yourself wondering, "Wait, is that person dead or alive?"

There's so much death, and so many characters, that it's certainly a possibility - even for someone who has been paying close attention.

It can also get hard to keep track of who's related to whom, so it also helps to keep track of where loyalties lie.

To help you with both of these problems, here's a handy guide to the life status of every member of the major noble houses in Westeros.

He's sort of an (dis)honorary Arryn, since he was briefly married to Lysa before he pushed her through the moon door, plus he's Lord Paramount of the Vale.
