  <title>Suicide how-to Google searches rose after Netflix release</title>
  <content>
The controversial series 13 Reasons Why triggered an increase in Google searches for specific methods of suicide and suicide hotline queries, US researchers suggest. 
The findings published Monday follows the release of Netflix's latest foray into youth mental illness, To The Bone, which prompted a  from youth mental health groups over its depiction of anorexia. 13 Reasons WhyPhoto: SMH
The researchers at San Diego State University used Google trends to compare the volume of US-based suicide-related Google searches in the weeks before and after the premiere of the show on March 31.

It sparked both emotional and reasoned debate over responsible media representations of suicide, and questioned whether the show glamorised teenage suicide or raised awareness about the  among Australians aged 15 to 24 years old. 
The study excluded any searches mentioning Suicide Squad, the recently released blockbuster film, so their findings would not be contaminated. 

Suicide searches were 19 per cent higher in the days following the premiere, amounting to 900,000 to 1.5 million more searches than expected, the researchers reported in a JAMA.

For 12 of the 19 days analysed, suicide searches were significantly higher than expected, ranging from 15 per cent on April 15 to 44 per cent on April 18. To The BonePhoto: Netflix
Seventeen of the top 20 suicide-related searches were higher than the researchers expected, with most focusing on suicidal ideation. 
"How to commit suicide" was 26 per cent higher, "commit suicide" was 18 per cent higher, and "how to kill yourself" was 9 per cent higher.
Searches for suicide hotlines also rose, including "suicide hotline number" (21 per cent) and suicide "hotline" (12 per cent). 
Public awareness-related searches were also up, with "suicide prevention" rising by 23 per cent and "teen suicide" 34 per cent higher. 
"13 Reasons Why elevated suicide awareness, but it is concerning that searches indicating suicidal ideation also rose," the researchers wrote.
It was not clear if any searchers attempted suicide after googling, but suicide search trends were correlated with actual suicides, media coverage of suicides were associated with an increase in suicide attempts, and searches for specific methods of suicide increased after the show's release, the authors said. 
"The deleterious effects of shows such as 13 Reasons Why could possibly be curtailed by following the World Health Organisation's media guidelines for preventing suicide," the authors suggested.
They included removing scenes showing suicide, and including a suicide hotline in every episode. 
The authors wanted the series retro-fitted with these changes, and included in the planned second season. 
US youth mental health experts warned that the show's success would foster similar "binge-watching" series. 
"This immersion into the story and images may have a particularly strong effect on adolescents, whose brains are still developing the ability to inhibit certain emotions, desires and actions," they wrote in a JAMA editorial.
Australia's  strongly urge against including explicit content, method and location details about suicide.
In April, Australian youth mental health foundation  an increase in the number of calls to its counselling services helplines from young people, parents and schools in the days after the show's release. 
Headspace issued a strong warning to viewers over the graphic scenes in the show. 
"There is a responsibility for broadcasters to know what they are showing and the impact that certain content can have on an audience - and a young audience in particular," said head of Headspace's online counselling service, Dr Steven Leicester.
