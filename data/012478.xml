For more than 20 years, Swedish label  has cultivated itself in the fashion industry as minimalistic and innovative, yet timeless; which are the exact design elements found in their second Sydney store, which opened last week.
Following the original space in Paddington, shoppers can expect to find the label's experimental textures, tones and silhouettes in the new 390 square metre CBD store.
Creating an "alternate universe" in the inspired L-shaped store, stainless steel walls and yellow hues dominate- a design ethos that unifies their design spaces worldwide. The stores' windows and ceilings have been lowered, and it features 700 lighting fixtures. Steel fixtures work harmoniously with organic benches and stools.
"We opened our first store in Sydney in 2009 and since then the Australian market has been very close to our hearts," said Acne Chairman Mikael Schiller.
 "Now it feels great to open a large second store in the central of Sydney, the space being a good representation of the present day Acne Studios universe."
, Monday to Wednesday, Friday 10am-7pm, Thursday, 10am-9pm, Saturday and Sunday 10am-7pm.

The ultimate Australian slashie has now added fashion designer to her colourful CV, alongside author, app guru and skin care brand creator. Making her debut in the fashion world, Zoe Foster Blake has added her signature flair to a collection in collaboration with Melbourne-based label.
The 'flothes' as Zoe dubbed them on Instagram (a cross between food and clothes) have a nostalgic 80s and 90s Australian undertone, and give us the opportunity to add a little bit of Zoe's effervescence to our wardrobe. The pieces feature her favourite foods, animals and lifestyle, think Iced Vovo jumpers, retro-inspired graphic tees, a graphic tee with 'Chips' written in red glitter and oversize wool knits featuring giant cockatoos (her "good luck omen") and lobsters.
"Skin and Threads offered me the chance to do anything  in our collaboration and I was sure my taste would be too fruity. But no! I was given total freedom to have my ideas sartorially realised," said Foster Blake.
"I selfishly made the collection something I would want to wear,here's hoping my love of bright colours, lobsters and hot chips translates."
While the 17-piece capsule collection does have an element of novelty, it also includes current trending silhouettes and wardrobe staples including a gingham trench coat, high-waisted cropped jeans and metallic pleated skirts perfect for weekend adventures or making a statement at your next event. You can shop the pre-sale now on the Skin and Threads website, with the full collection available in six  stores nationwide and the brand's Myer concessions from Monday August 7.

Pair your jeans with a button up shirt and blazer for a casual friday work look, otherwise opt for double denim or teaming with a faux fur jacket for evening events.  If you want to take your look one step further in the fashion conscious stakes, wear your favourite vintage or custom denim with an old tee to show your support for sustainable fashion. If we are honest, goodwill is the best trending style to follow, and we have some style inspiration for you in our cart this week,
Jeans for Genes ambassador Nadia Bartel hasto our Melbourne Sale Whisperer, Melissa Singer for how to style the latest denim trends. She said she's encouraging her friends to "get wilder than ever before when it comes to their denim looks".
"Frayed, distressed, embroidered and even double denim, the more fun, the better," she said.
