  <title>MFB top brass exodus continues in Vic</title>
  <content>
The exodus of top brass from Melbourne's Metropolitan Fire Brigade has continued with acting chief officer Paul Stacchino the latest to quit the organisation.
The MFB announced his resignation on Tuesday, less than a month after the brigade lost chief executive Jim Higgins, who also left.
Acting CEO Russel Eddington said Mr Stacchino had "helped steer the organisation through some challenging times" but did not provide a reason for the departure.
The MFB is due to be merged with paid firefighters from the CFA to create Fire Rescue Victoria, in a government bid to circumvent federal laws preventing a controversial union pay deal being signed.
Mr Stacchino raised his concerns about CEO powers at a Fire Services Bill Select Committee in July.
"What will be the concern for me in the office of chief officer is that the new Fire Rescue Victoria will not have within its governance structure a board, a CEO or a chief officer," he told the committee.
Emergency Services Minister James Merlino said Mr Stacchino had made the decision to resign and wished him "all the best".

The departure also follows that of MFB chief officer Peter Rau in September over what his wife said was bullying from the United Firefighters Union, and deputy chief officer David Youssef in October.
