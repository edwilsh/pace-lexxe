From Today's 
Financial Review
: The money-laundering scandal could be the tipping point that breaks down CBA's insular approach to technology development.
: Fund managers slam government for failing to protect mum-and-dad investors from franking credit losses.
: Having purged former Naked CEO Alex Malley from the CPA website, remaining board members will now follow him out the door.

United States

US stocks were slightly up in early afternoon trading on Monday, with the Dow on track to close at a record high for the ninth straight day, after squeezing out another all-time high just after the open.
The rise in the Dow also put the blue-chip index on track to close higher for the 10th straight day, its longest streak of consecutive gains since February.
"We have strong earnings that is helping the market," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group.
"I have seen a lot of companies exceeding their revenue growth and we also have better-than-expected global growth, which are the main drivers for equities."
Analysts, on average, expect S&P 500 earnings to have expanded 12 per cent in the second quarter and project earnings up 9.3 per cent for the September quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Tesla said it would raise about $US1.5 billion through its first-ever high-yield junk bond offering, as the US luxury electric car maker seeks fresh sources of cash to ramp up production of its new Model 3 sedan.
Hedge fund investor Leon Cooperman, the chief executive of Omega Advisors, told cable television network CNBC that his firm's biggest position was a bullish bet on Google parent Alphabet.

Cooperman said that his position in Alphabet shares constituted between 4-4.5 per cent of his fund and cited the company's excess cash and strong earnings growth as reasons for its being "not expensive". He also said First Data Corp was one of his fund's second-largest holdings.
Europe

European stocks held steady after Friday's biggest rally in three weeks spurred by strong US jobs data.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 0.1 per cent at the close.
ArcelorMittal led a gauge of mining stocks to the best gains among industry groups as steel and iron-ore prices surged. The measure is overtaking the broader benchmark in 2017 after lagging it in the first half. Media stocks slid 0.6 per cent while drug makers fell for the fourth time in five days.
Among shares active on corporate news, Paddy Power Betfair slipped 4.7 per cent after saying chief executive officer Breon Corcoran will step down after 16 years with the betting company.
PostNL fell 5.1 per cent after predicting that full-year operating income will be near the lower end of a previously forecast range.
Data on Monday showed German industrial production unexpectedly slipped in June. That follows evidence last week that momentum at the start of the third quarter lagged behind that of France, Italy and Spain for the first time in 12 years.

Germany's DAX Index slid 0.3 per cent on Monday. The measure has turned into one of the biggest laggards among global peers since a June record.
The Stoxx 600 is down about 3.6 per cent from a peak in May, amid bets that the strengthening euro will trim profit growth for the region's exporters.
Asia

Hong Kong stocks posted modest gains on Monday, buoyed by strength in technology firms as well as Chinese resource and financial shares.
The Hang Seng index ended up 0.5 per cent at 27,690.36 points, while the China Enterprises Index gained 0.5 per cent to 11,054.41.
Information technology firms were the top performers, with the sector index advancing 2.9 per cent.
Social media and gaming giant Tencent Holdings rose 3 per cent to close at a record high of $HK320.60.
China stocks ended higher across the board on Monday, shaking off early losses, as investors bet upcoming data will continue to show strong economic growth.

The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.5 per cent to 3726.88 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.5 per cent to 3279.46.
Analysts had attributed early losses to investors taking a wait-and-see approach to Chinese data scheduled to start rolling out this week. China will post trade data on Tuesday and inflation on Wednesday. Bank lending numbers could come later this week while industrial output, retail sales and investment readings will be released next Monday.
Currencies

: A rising currency works against the broad economy, and the market.
The Federal Reserve can leave interest rates where they are for now because inflation is not likely to rise much even if the US job market continues to improve, St. Louis Fed president James Bullard said on Monday.
"The current level of the policy rate is likely to remain appropriate over the near term," Bullard told the America's Cotton Marketing Cooperatives 2017 Conference in Nashville, Tennessee.
Bullard said recent readings of low inflation are "concerning" because they may not be temporary but indicative of persistent factors such as better technology that is driving down the price of many goods and services.
Bullard does not vote on monetary policy this year at the Fed, though he participates in the central bank's regular policy discussions in Washington.

Mexico's peso slipped to a nearly one-month low against the US dollar as the impending start of talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement gave the market a renewed bout of jitters. The peso sank to a record low in January on fears that President Donald Trump would rip up NAFTA, but it has rallied as his administration has taken a more conciliatory tone and moved to renegotiate the 23-year-old accord.
Commodities

A surge in the billet market over the weekend gave iron ore prices a big boost on Monday, Metal Bulletin reported.
Hebei's provincial government announced late last Friday that several cities, including Shijiazhuang, Tangshan and Handan, will see steel production capped at 50 per cent of capacity during the heating season from November to March. The announcement sparked big gains in the ferrous markets - the price of billet increased by 120 yuan ($US17.80) per tonne over the weekend, and rose a further 30 yuan ($US4.50) per tonne on Monday. Prices for finished steel, in turn, rose on Monday.
Oil prices fell as much as 2 per cent on selling triggered by a rebound in production from Libya's largest oil field, along with worries about higher output from OPEC and the United States.
Output at Libya's Sharara field was returning to normal after a brief disruption by armed protesters in the coastal city of Zawiya, the National Oil Corporation (NOC) said. The field has boosted Libya's oil production, which climbed to more than 1 million bpd in late June.
Australian Sharemarket

The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index and the broader All Ordinaries Index each lifted 0.9 per cent to 5773.6 points and 5824.5 points, respectively.
