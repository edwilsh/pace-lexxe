  <title>Laurie Oakes to retire</title>
  <content>
Veteran Channel Nine political reporter Laurie Oakes will retire later this month.
The network has announced the 73-year-old's last day will be on August 18.
Oakes graduated from Sydney University in 1964 with a Bachelor of Arts and joined the Daily Mirror before moving to television reporting with Channel 10 in 1975.
The three-time Walkley Award-winner moved to Channel Nine five years later and has become a Canberra bureau institution.
He said covering politics was "an addiction".
"But now I'll be able to devote more time to reading crime fiction," Mr Oakes quoted Oakes as saying.
"That will be my equivalent of a methadone program."
More to come.
