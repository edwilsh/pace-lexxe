  <title>US decries Russia</title>
  <content>
The United States has described  as "uncalled for", with the country now weighing its options, a State Department official has said.
On Friday Moscow ordered the US to cut hundreds of diplomatic staff and said it would seize two US diplomatic properties.
Putin said in an interview with Vesti TV that 755 US diplomatic and technical staff would have to leave Russia by September 1.
"Because more than 1000 workers - diplomats and support staff - were working and are still working in Russia, 755 must stop their activity in the Russian Federation," he said.
A US official has said: "This is a regrettable and uncalled for act. We are assessing the impact of such a limitation and how we will respond to it."
New US sanctions were in part a response to conclusions by US intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 US presidential election, and to further punish Russia for its annexation of Crimea in 2014.
The bill, which passed the Senate on Thursday by a vote of 98-2, would give Congress new power to stop President Trump from easing sanctions against Moscow.
It would also set into law penalties President Barack Obama's administration imposed against Russia in December for meddling in the US election last year and for its aggression in Ukraine.

Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats and closed Russian compounds in Maryland and New York. At the time, Russia did not mount a proportional response.

Moscow said on Friday the US had until September 1 to reduce its diplomatic staff in Russia to 455 people, matching the number of Russian diplomats left in the US after Washington expelled 35 Russians in December.
On Friday an official at the US Embassy, who did not wish to be identified, said the Embassy employed about 1100 diplomatic and support staff in Russia, including Russian and US citizens.
Putin said that Russia could take more measures against the US but not at the moment.
He repeated that the US sanctions were another sign of worsening relations between the two countries.
However, he said Moscow and Washington were achieving results on cooperation even "in this quite difficult situation". The creation of the Southern de-escalation zone in Syria showed a concrete result of the joint work between the two countries, Putin said.
