  <title>Enjoy great family reading, by gum</title>
  <content>
HUGH Hayward is well on his way to passing down his favourite tales to his daughter Marlowe.
The two-year-old is enjoying classics such as Tales From The Gum Tree, which features a set of characters close to Mr Hayward's heart.
"I remember the characters from when I was a kid," he said.
"It's nice to be able to share these stories and have that nostalgia. The good old days and values are still around to be passed on to our kids."
