  <title>Vic magazine-reading home invader arrested</title>
  <content>
A police officer has been injured while arresting an alleged burglar who was found flicking through magazines in a home in Melbourne.
A Frankston woman called police when she discovered an unknown man in her home during the early hours of Friday morning, and when police arrived the magazine-reading home invader resisted arrest, injuring an officer.
The 27-year old Frankston man was taken to hospital under police guard for facial injuries suffered during the arrest and is expected to be interviewed on Friday morning.
