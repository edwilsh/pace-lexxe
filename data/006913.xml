  <content>
The Australian Centre for Robotic Vision has taken out the top prize at the  Challenge. Their entry in the Grand Championship in Combined Task section picked the team up a lazy US$80,000.

The competition is held over several events that started back last November when teams put in their proposals. Last week, the teams competed with the Aussies coming out on top against a number of teams from a cross the world.

In order to win, the ACRV team had to comete tasks such as object recognition, pose recognition, grasp planning, compliant manipulation, motion planning, task planning, task execution, and error detection and recovery to successfully pick and stow unique items.

The Amazon Robotics Challenge was held during the RoboCup at the Nagoya International Exhibition Hall in Japan.
