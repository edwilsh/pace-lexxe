Two ACT Policing officers illegally accessed the AFP's database for a recording of a confidential CrimeStoppers tipoff, but have avoided jail time.
ACT Policing and AFP officers face two years jail for accessing information off the Police Real-Time Management Information System not in line with their official duties.
The matter was subject of an internal conduct report, obtained under a freedom of information request but heavily redacted.
A criminal investigation was dropped by the internal watchdog after it failed to determine how the officer gained access to the Crimestoppers tipoff.

The sun will keep shining in more of Woden's town centre, if a revised draft plan is passed. The plan includes a rule for a minimum of three hours of sun a day to be retained to the town square, as well as to adjoining homes.
The plan also shows Athllon Drive will be rezoned for higher density housing between Hindmarsh Drive and Callam Street.
It reduces the area set aside for a new supermarket east of Callam Street to allow for a small convenience store instead.

A 74-year-old man who took advantage of a woman with an IQ of 40, and who was 40 years younger than him, has been jailed.
He had known the woman since she was 9, and he was fully aware of her intellectual limitations, a court has heard. Her intellectual disability meant she could not consent to sex.
"Masquerading as a quasi-carer, the offender took advantage of [the woman] for over three years to satisfy his own sexual appetite," Justice Elkaim said.
