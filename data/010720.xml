  <title>Suncorp profit lifts 3.6% to $1.08bn</title>
  <content>
Suncorp's full-year profit has risen 3.6 per cent to $1.075 billion, with gains in the Australian insurance business helping offset lower margins in banking and a fall in its New Zealand units profit.
The Sydney-based financial services provider's revenue for the 12 months to June 30 rose 12.3 per cent to $17.39 billion compared to a year ago.
Suncorp has declared a final dividend of 40 cents a share, taking its full-year distribution to 73 cents, which is up five cents on last year.
