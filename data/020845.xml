A MAN armed with a shotgun has stormed a Scone bank and robbed tellers of cash.

Police said the bandit entered the Kelly Street bank about 11.15am and threatened employees with the shotgun.

He was handed an amount of cash before fleeing the scene.

None of the attendants were injured.
He got into a blue vehicle, which was last seen heading west on Kingdon Road. 
The man is described as being of a large build, wearing a blue hooded jumper with grey long pants, white joggers, black and grey-coloured camouflage pattern hooded jacket. 
He was carrying a green bag and was armed with what was believed to be a shotgun.
Hunter Valley detectives are investigating.
