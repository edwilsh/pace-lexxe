  <title>'Get stuffed': Brownless unleashes on umpires</title>
  <content>
BILLY Brownless has unleashed on the umpires from Friday night's clash between Geelong and Sydney at Simonds Stadium.
While the free kicks were an even 25-25 by the conclusion of the match, Brownless suggested the Cats had been harshly dealt with in crunch moments, including at the start of the final term when Mitch Duncan was penalised for tummy tapping Tom Papley.
"I tell you who can get stuffed," Brownless said on Triple M.
"The umpires! They can get stuffed!" What happened in the start of the last quarter?
"(Tom) Papley goes down, he dives, don't worry about that! Took a dive, I don't blame him, that's what blokes do to get a 50-metre (penalty) or a reverse free kick.
"The umpire was right there, he pays a soft free kick, then he misses the bloody goal - he may as well have kicked it for him, the umpire!
"And then Wylie Buzza kicks one from 70, one of the great goals of all time ... I don't know what happened! What happened with Wylie Buzza's kick from 70?!"
The tirade comes days after .
