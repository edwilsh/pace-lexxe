A mumbling man punched a woman in the side of the head in an unprovoked attack in Thornbury.
The woman, 29, was strolling down Mansfield Street about 10.15pm on July 25 when a man approached her from behind.
She screamed, and the man punched her in the side of the head before running off toward Dundas Street.
The woman later told police her attacker was about 183 centimetres tall, with dark skin and closely cropped hair. He was mumbling and slurring in a foreign language.
With the victim's help police have put together a composite image of the man. Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
