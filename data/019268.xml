Endurance: Madeline Hills will compete in the 5000m heats later this week after finishing 26th in the 10,000m final.

ILLAWARRA'S Madeline Hills will return to the track on Friday (AEST) for the 5000m world championships heats, after finishing 26th in the 10,000m final in London on Sunday morning (AEST).
Continuing her move into the longer distance disciplines, Hills, stopped the clock in 32:48.57, 22 seconds behind Australian counterpart Eloise Wellings, who was 22nd. 
The entire field was blown away by remarkable Ethiopian Almaz Ayana, who added the world title to the Olympic crown she won last year in Rio. Ayana clocked a winning time of 30 minutes 16.32 seconds, with the winning margin of 46.37 seconds to countrywoman Tirunesh Dibaba easily the biggest in world championships history.
Hills has previously recorded a personal best of 31:41.10 to qualify for the 10,000m event at a meet in the US. 
Only returning to full time training in 2013, Hills was seventh in the steeplechase in a time of 9:20.38 and 10th in the 5000m in 15:04.05 at the Rio Games last year.
The heats for the world championships 5000m will be held at the 2012 London Olympic stadium on Friday morning (AEST), before the final is run on the last day of competition on Monday next week.
Meanwhile, Bulli's Ryan Gregson will compete in the 1500m heats on Friday (AEST). 
The national record holder and two-time Olympian is in some career-best form, Gregson clocked his fastest ever 3000m time in a Diamond League meet in Morocco last month.
The 1500m final is also Monday next week.
