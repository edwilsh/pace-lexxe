  <title>Trial Banned Drinkers Reister roll out begins</title>

DARWIN sports clubs will test run the Banned Drinkers Register ahead of next month's roll out of the Gunner Government's alcohol management policy.
Health Minister Natasha Fyles announced the month-long trial to test the technology at St Mary's football club today.
The BDR scanners will be rolled out across the Territory on September 1, Ms Fyles said.
The trial run begins this week for anyone wanting to buy takeaway alcohol from the club.
She said some of the older technology used previously had been replaced with new machines, which scanned IDs within two seconds.
"We're taking action by bringing forward the roll out of new BDR devices across the Northern Territory ensuring the best possible response times," she said.
