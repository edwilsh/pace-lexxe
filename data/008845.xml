  <title>Ewen's top of his game</title>
  <content>
WALKING on to set with three top Hollywood names was daunting, to say the least, for Collingwood actor Ewen Leslie.
The 37-year-old plays opposite Nicole Kidman in the second season of Jane Campion's acclaimed Top Of The Lake, which also stars Elisabeth Moss.
All six episodes of Top of the Lake: China Girl premiere at the Melbourne International Film Festival on Saturday, when Leslie will watch it with Campion for the first time.
"At this stage of my career, to find myself opposite Nicole, with Elisabeth and being directed by Jane ... three very strong women at the top of their game, it was daunting but obviously really rewarding," Leslie said.
"I learned a lot on that job ... there were times when I would want to follow natural instincts but Jane would be like look, no," he said.
But having commanded the stage for three hours straight as Richard III for the MTC in 2010, Leslie certainly was capable of holding his own. "I barely left the stage," he said of that performance.
"I do love the immediacy of theatre ... the nature of shooting film and TV is that it stops you from having that," Leslie said.
Four years after Campion's first series of Top of the Lake, set in New Zealand, the second series picks up in Bondi, Sydney, with Elisabeth Moss back as Detective Robin Griffin.
She's paired with partner Miranda, played by Gwendoline Christie, the formidable Brienne of Tarth from Game of Thrones.
The storyline centres on the body of a sex worker found washed up in a suitcase on Bondi Beach.
But a big unanswered question from series one was what had happened to Griffin's child, who she gave birth to and gave up for adoption after being gang-raped at 15.
Series two introduces us to that child, Mary, now 17 and living in Sydney. Her adoptive parents, Pyke and Julia, played by Leslie and Kidman, have just split up.
"I play someone who's stuck I suppose, in a bit of a rut, inactive and depressed," Leslie said.
"But he has an amazing relationship with Mary, who doesn't have a great relationship with her mother and resents the breakup."
Four years ago, there was never any intention to make a second series of Top of the Lake, Leslie said.
"It was a pretty bold move (to continue the story) in Bondi, given the (New Zealand) setting was so intrinsic to Top of the Lake," Leslie said.
Top of the Lake: China Girl, Forum Theatre, from 10am on August 5. Screenings will be followed by a Q & A with Campion, writer Ariel Kleiman, screenwriter Gerard Lee and Ewen Leslie with fellow cast member Alice Englert.
It screens on Foxtel and BBC First from August 20.
