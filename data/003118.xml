cameo

SPOILER ALERT Ed Sheeran's cameo stirs up fans as season seven of Game of Thrones kicks off.

"As most of you have probably heard by now, there has been a cyber incident directed at the company which has resulted in some stolen proprietary information, including some of our programming," HBO Chairman Richard Plepler wrote in a message to employees, which the company shared with reporters.
The company declined to comment on reports that unbroadcast episodes and scripts were among the data hacked, citing an "ongoing investigation" by unspecified law enforcement officials.

Entertainment Weekly reported that hackers stole 1.5 terabytes of data and had already posted online unbroadcast episodes of "Ballers" and "Room 104," along with "a script or treatment" for next week's episode of "Game of Thrones."
Reuters also received an e-mail on Sunday from a person claiming to have stolen HBO data, including "Game of Thrones."Photo: HBO
The show is now in its seventh season and due to wrap up next year.
