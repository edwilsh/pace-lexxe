  <title>Raceday focus: Warracknabeal</title>
  <content>
BALLARAT trainer Archie Alexander will take a strong squad of horses to Warracknabeal.
In his brief time at Ballarat, Alexander has had nine starters at the Wimmera track for two winners, a second and two thirds.
He has five horses entered and he's confident they will be around the mark.

BEST BET

NIL DESPERANDUM (R9, No. 10 $3.40)
Resumed from a spell with an easy win at her second start at Mildura. Her trainer Patrick Payne said before and after the win that he regards her as a smart mare. Stick with her.
NEXT BEST

LA DALLIANCE (R10, No. 10 $4.40)
Been racing consistently. Close-up behind the in-form Antagonist last start at Geelong Synthetic which reads well for this.
VALUE BET

UNIQUE STORM (R8, No. 10 $9.50)
1000m specialist back to her pet distance. Well drawn and should run a bold race.
THE TRAINER

ARCHIE ALEXANDER

BRUNILLA (R1, No. 12)
"I think she'll go really well. She's trialled well at Ballarat. She's got to improve on her debut but that was a hot maiden."
STAR D'VEGA (R5, No. 12 $26)
"She hasn't shown much in her two starts over shorter journeys but she'll be suited by the step up in distance. I'm hoping for improvement and thinking she's a top three chance."
DEEP SEA LADY (R6, No. 11 $15)
"Blinkers go on her first time. If she could return to her best she could win but I'm sitting on the fence."
LA DALLIANCE (R10, No. 10 $4.40) "She looks well placed in a Benchmark 58. She should go close but my main concern is whether the track is wet."
CASINO BLITZ (R10, No. 15 $8.50)
"I don't think there's much between them and if it was a heavy track he'd be a really good chance."
THE JOCKEY

Ryan Maloney took the honours for ride of the day with his one mount at Caulfield last Saturday, Every Faith winning. Maloney has had eight rides this week for two firsts, one second and three thirds. He has seven rides today at Warracknabeal made including four rides for Patrick Payne highlighted by MASTERSON (R7, No. 2 $3.40) and NIL DESPERANDUM (R9, No. 10 $3.40).
