  <title>Knights aim higher with winning run</title>
  <content>
SIX weeks ago, the Ipswich Knights could only dream of holding Grange Thistle scoreless.
But their latest Brisbane Premier League performance showed how much the team's commitment and mental application has improved since that mid-season slump.
After beating Grange Thistle 1-0 in Thursday night's catch-up match, stand-in captain Dale Robinson is aiming even higher.
He hopes the Knights can strive for sixth place by beating championship contenders Peninsula in their next football clash on August 12 before a shot at Capalaba in their final home game on August 19.
Such a positive attitude typifies how the Knights have tightened up their defence and managed to find the net when it counts - like Emmanuel Peter's 80th minute match-winning header from a terrific Jack Cabassi cross out wide.
"It just seems to have turned the corner,'' Robinson said. "As a whole unit we are working a lot better together.''
Robinson has been captaining the side in recent weeks with good friend Dan Liddy out injured. He's happy to share the responsibility with Liddy, who has been regaining his fitness in the Knights' past two victories.
While the Knights' latest win was far from perfect, Robinson said it was pleasing seeing the players respond to coach Danny Wilson's call after a tough period.
"Grange is always a very physical side,'' Robinson said. "They have a couple of big boys and matching it with them is probably the main focus of the game.''
Robinson has been playing in a centre back role with Takuto Kakimoto, assisted by right back Cabassi and left back Devon Munn.
