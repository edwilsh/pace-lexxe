  <title>Melbourne Express: Friday, August 4, 2017</title>
  <content>
Recap: A man is in critical condition after being hit by a car in Bittern last night, Ambulance Victoria says.
The man aged in his 20s was struck on Frankston-Flinders Road just before 8.30pm.
He sustained head injuries and was rushed to The Alfred in a critical condition.

There has been a crash on the Western Ring Road, near the Tullamarine exit. 

I'll see what else I can find out.
Hammer-wielding thieves have held up a service station in Laverton North. 

Police said four masked men, one armed with a hammer, struck the Little Boundary Road service station just after 3am. 

The men assaulted the attendant and stole an amount of cash and cigarettes, before fleeing in a silver sedan, possibly a Holden Astra.

The attendant was not injured. 

Police are urging anyone with information on the hold up to contact Crime Stoppers.

It turns out yesterday was the coldest day of the year so far. It didn't even make double digits yesterday, with the temperature reaching a top of just 8.9 degrees in Melbourne. 

Today will be slightly warmer, with a top of 13 degrees expected. 

We're also in for a rainy few days, but then again after such a Dry July it's a good thing Melbourne will be getting some decent precipitation. 

It's going to be a cold and wet weekend Photo: Craig Butt

Hopefully the trains will all be working today!
