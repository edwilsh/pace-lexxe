  <title>Tasmania's Commissioner for Children Mark Morrissey quits for part-time work</title>
  <content>
Tasmania's Commissioner for Children Mark Morrissey has quit, and will leave the role next month.
Mr Morrisey said he had decided to move to part-time work after more than three decades in senior leadership roles.
He said the challenge for child protection in Tasmania was now to actually make changes.
"After a long career spent working in leadership roles in children's policy development and service delivery, I am very clear that the greatest challenge lies not just in developing policy, but in its implementation," he said in a statement.
"Implementation is never easy. It must be done in a way which allows continual review, reflection and improvement with a clear focus on the long-term outcomes and benefits intended to be achieved.
"Quite simply, it takes time and commitment."
Mr Morrissey said the Government had committed to reform child protection and out-of-home care.
"The reforms recommended in the Child Protection Redesign authored by Professor Maria Harries, if fully implemented, provide a clear way forward," he said.
"I would encourage all sides of politics to stay the course with the current set of reforms to the child protection and out-of-home care systems in Tasmania, and implement a system of independent expert oversight of the reform process, as recommended in my 2017 report."
Mr Morrisey's 2017 report looked .
It found the number of deaths of children and young people due to intentional self-harm was higher in Tasmania than nationally.
Children in the state were found to have poorer dental health than the national average and alcohol and drug use was above the national average.
Mr Morrissey also found approximately 30 per cent of Tasmanian children aged between 12 and 15 were overweight and nearly 10 per cent were obese.
He was appointed to Commissioner for Children role in October 2014.
Government thanks Morrissey for reform push

Human Services Minister Jacquie Petrusma said Mr Morrissey had made a significant contribution.
"Mr Morrissey has been an active participant in our reforms to the child protection system, helping to shape future services," she said.
"He has been a strong advocate for the need for these reforms and for the redesign of the system, and we thank him particularly for his work in this regard.
"On behalf of the Government, I express my sincere appreciation to Mr Morrissey for his service to Tasmanian children and young people, and wish him well in all his future endeavours."
The Government intends to fill the role of Commissioner for Children and Young People as soon as possible following Mr Morrissey's departure.
