  <title>Which clubs are hardest hit by injury?</title>
  <content>
GREATER Western Sydney may yet prove to be as -unstoppable as the Terminator this season.
Adelaide has clear air for another premiership push and Port Adelaide's resurgence has solid foundations.
Melbourne's rollercoaster season looks more glass half-full than half-empty, while St Kilda appears to have run out of excuses.
BRETT DELEDIO:
FIRST CLASS:
We refer to the 2017 hurt ladder - the table where every game a player has missed through injury is recorded alongside a quality measure showing the direct scoreboard impact.
The Giants are clearly on top. Ravaged by injury to such an extent they launched a mid-season review of their own procedures, they are still third on the real ladder.
Unkillable? Maybe. But for a team many critics have -portrayed as an AFL-created machine, Judgement Day is coming. Can they all get them all back and in form in time?
With Brett Deledio, Ryan Griffen and Stephen Coniglio among the injured, GWS has missed 167 games for an estimated loss of 385 points on the scoreboard - 3 1/2 goals a week.
"I think every coach and high-performance manager looks at why your injuries come around," coach Leon Cameron said last month.
"So just looking into every aspect of the way we train - the surface we train on, how the injuries are sustained ... think every club does that when they have injuries.
"What probably came of it was probably 95 per cent of it is just unlucky - that's just the way it is and there's probably five per cent we can probably do a little bit better at."
West Coast is second for scoreboard pain. With Nic Naitanui out long-term and Josh Kennedy missing games, Champion Data's formula has the Eagles losing 264 points.
Melbourne is 10-8 in an up-and-down season, but the loss of Max Gawn and Nathan Jones cost 248 points.
The Crows have been relatively fortunate with injury, while Port Adelaide has been charmed, losing only 81 points in 18 games.
Geelong has missed 110 games through injury - the sixth-most - but not many have been to stars. The Cats have lost only 138 points, the fifth fewest.
St Kilda, despite a quiet medical room (second-fewest games missed and third-fewest points lost) so far has been underwhelming in a season that promised more.
