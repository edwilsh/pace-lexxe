  <title>Big crocodile wants to tell a 'tail'</title>
  <content>
A HUGE 4m boss croc is stalking the Blackmore River near Southport.
This shot of the monster was taken by Gippsland couple Wayne and Margaret Bastin as they put out crab pots on the river.
Mr Bastin said they cut the motor and drifted nearby to admire the beast.
"We're not used to looking out for crocs. You can see how easily you can get caught out if you're not paying attention," he said.

The massive croc had clearly faced off with an equally terrifying beast. Part of its tail was missing.
The Bastins were staying with Southport resident Glenn Norris, who said big crocs were a frequent sight in the river. He said people were often far too complacent.
"You see people (doing dangerous things) all the time - putting boats in at the ramps where they're at the back of the boat in deeper water. I've seen people swimming in the river," he said.
The 4m croc isn't the biggest to make itself known in the river in recent times.
Last year, a 4.7m crocodile was taken from the river.
