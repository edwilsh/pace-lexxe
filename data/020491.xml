  <title>Tobruk Rat grateful for his ton of fortune</title>
  <content>
RAT of Tobruk Bill Corey will join the special ranks of returned servicemen when he celebrates his 100th birthday on Monday.
Mr Corey, who "only feels about 80", grew up in Tarlee in the state's lower Mid North and went off to war at age 22.
He spent more than five years living on tinned food, but declares that he was "born lucky" and blessed with good health over the past century.
"To live through those dust storms in the desert, the heat, moisture and rain in New Guinea and Borneo and to still be alive at 100 - I guess it is a bit remarkable," he said.
"Since I've turned 90, I've had an unbelievable life because I've represented Australia back in Brunei, Singapore and Egypt."
The Rats of Tobruk are an elite group of Australian soldiers who fought in the Middle East in World War II.
Mr Corey served in the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion - a unit especially famed for its actions at Tobruk and the battles of El Alamein.
There are few survivors now, although one West Australian veteran and South Australian Len Allen also celebrated their 100th birthdays this year.
More than 3000 Australian Rats lost their lives at Tobruk and more than 900 were captured and became POWs.
Over his lifetime, Mr Corey recalls technological changes from horse and carts to cars, radios to colour television.
Mr Corey was married to his late wife Iris for 61 years, and cooks and cares for himself, with the help of his son Don and daughter Dianne.
"I've had a wonderful life," he said.
"I've always been very moderate in everything and I've always been positive, and I've always laughed a lot."
Minister for Veterans' Affairs Martin Hamilton-Smith thanked Mr Corey, who served with his grandfather, for his contribution to the state.
"I admire his courage and his attitude which epitomises the contribution, loyalty and sacrifice of all those South Australians who have served in conflicts since Federation," he said.
On Monday, Mr Corey will share morning tea with the South Australian governor Hieu Van Le to celebrate the remarkable milestone.
