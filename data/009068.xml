  <title>Andrew Denton to undergo heart surgery 'within days'</title>
  <content>
AUSTRALIAN television presenter Andrew Denton will undergo a triple bypass '' after being diagnosed with advanced heart disease.

The brainchild and former host of 'Enough Rope' had been scheduled to help power the campaign to legalise assisted dying in Victoria.

The 57-year-old is one of the faces of the campaign in his role as a director of Go Gentle Australia - a leading advocate for voluntary euthanasia.

However, Denton has now been forced to quit the campaign trail to focus on his health.

Go Gentle Australia campaign manager Paul Price insisted Denton's absence wouldn't derail the group's efforts.

"The Go Gentle campaign continues in full force," Mr Price told .

"In the next weeks and months we will be marshalling the support of the more than 75 per cent of Victorians who want voluntary assisted dying to become law."

Mr Price said Denton hoped he would be back by September.

Victorian politicians will be granted a conscience vote on voluntary euthanasia later this year.
