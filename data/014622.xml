  <content>
A lawyer linked to embattled former Ipswich mayor Paul Pisasale says he plans to defend an extortion charge levelled against himself.

Magistrate Anthony Gett made an order to suppress the name of the alleged extortion victim.
During a brief hearing, the court heard the 35-year-old's charge "somewhat relates" to another matter recently heard before the court.
According to the charge sheet, Mr McKenzie is accused of demanding money, with a threat to cause "detriment" to another person, between January 31 and March 17.
Outside court, Mr McKenzie said he would defend the charge.
He remained on bail, with his matter to be heard next on August 21.
