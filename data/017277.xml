  <title>Rare Penfolds Grange wine set for auction</title>
  <content>
A rare complete set of Penfolds Grange wine is set to go under the hammer in Adelaide and could fetch up to $280,000.
The set is made up of 62 bottles from the 1951 to 2012 vintages, with some signed by the Penfolds' chief winemakers of the day.
Auctioneer Marc du Plessis says there has been keen interest in the set which will be sold on Sunday.
"You might find one complete set come up every 10 or 15 years at auction," Mr du Plessis told AAP.
A similar set in Melbourne was reportedly sold for $300,00 last year.
Penfolds Grange is considered a cornerstone of the Australian wine market and is officially heritage listed by the South Australian National Trust.
It has won numerous awards both nationally and internationally.
The 1951 Grange was legendary winemaker Max Schubert's first vintage, with many of the bottles given away to friends.
But buyers now pay upwards of $50,000 to get their hands on a single bottle.
