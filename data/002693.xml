  <title>Trump, Mooch 'speak same language'</title>
  <content>
FORMER House Speaker Newt Gingrich said President Trump and his communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who went on an X-rated tirade against the former White House chief of staff, speak the "same language."
"President Trump is a New Yorker. He and Scaramucci sort of speak the same language," Mr Gingrich told John Catsimatidis on the Cats Roundtable radio show on 970 AM in an interview that aired on Sunday. "And this way he has somebody that makes him kind of comfortable that he's getting taken care of."
"Scaramucci is an entrepreneur. He's aggressive. Trump wants somebody willing to mix it up with the news media, get in the middle of the fight, try to get things done," said Mr Gingrich, a former Republican congressman from Georgia,
Mr Trump named Mr Scaramucci, a Long Island native and former hedge fund executive, to head up the White House communications department on July 21 in a shake-up that led to the resignation of press secretary Sean Spicer.
Mr Gingrich said he thinks the president appreciates the tough-talking Mr Scaramucci having his back.
"I think that Trump is probably very happy with him right now and I think that's good for Trump himself because part of the reason Trump gets so aggressive is he feels like nobody is defending him and he's gotta go out and do it all himself," he said.
In an interview with The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza, Mr Scaramucci railed against Reince Priebus, who he had been feuding with in the White House.
"Reince is a f - king paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac," Mr Scaramucci said in the profanity-laced interview that was published on Thursday.
By Friday, Mr Preibus, a former chair of the Republican National Committee, was out as chief of staff, and Mr Trump named John Kelly, his Homeland Security director, as his replacement.
