  <title>How a morning cooking club is preserving Jewish culture, one recipe at a time</title>
  <content>
On a Monday morning in Sydney's eastern suburbs, a group of women have gathered together to cook.
They've been doing this for the past 11 years.
Their mission: to gather the best Jewish recipes from Sydney and around the world and preserve them for future generations.

"In the beginning, our aim was to write a book for charity," said Lisa Goldberg, who has been given the title of Chief Pot Stirrer.
"It then evolved into this incredible project.
"We started off collecting the best, most loved recipes from our food-obsessed community in Sydney, then we went Australia-wide and then we went to the world."

More than a decade later the Monday Morning Cooking Club is going strong.
"The aim was to find recipes, to collect, to curate, to test - of course re-test obsessively - so that we could then preserve and share them with the whole world through our books," Ms Goldberg said.
The offerings range from traditional recipes for lavosh crackers, chicken soup and matzo balls, to pickled carrots and shortbread.

"Every recipe that we have in the book comes with a story about the cook that's given it to us," said Natanya Eskin, who has been with the club since its inception in 2006.
"One wonderful story is from a grandmother who came to us with a little scrap of paper, a recipe called fladen.
"It's an old world European cake that was her mother's recipe. She had never made it herself, she just had her mother's scrap of paper.
"We made it, it is now in the book for the world to have and also for her future generations to have as well."
The women have used social media to broaden their search worldwide, asking people to send them their treasured Jewish recipes.

In their latest book, not surprisingly called It's Always About the Food, they've gathered recipes from Cardiff, New York, Sydney, Jerusalem, Johannesburg and Nova Scotia.
The group say they want to preserve and honour the recipes and stories of their community.

Cooking club member Merelyn Chalmers loves sharing tips and techniques and teaching unconfident cooks how easy it is to create an impressive meal.
Her mother's chiffon cake was legendary and was kept as her secret recipe for 50 years.
That recipe was published by the cooking club and Ms Chalmers said it was now baked all over the world, carrying on her mother's legacy.
"To me, food without memory is just digestion," Ms Chalmers said.
"By preserving these recipes, we're really preserving people's memories."
