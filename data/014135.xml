  <content>
WHILE she appears on local TV screens this weekend, Aussie actor Emma Booth will already be in Canada shooting scenes for one of the biggest shows in the world.
Booth, who appears in Channel 7's highly anticipated Roger Rogerson biopic Blue Murder: Killer Cop from this Sunday, has signed on with hit US drama Once Upon A Time. She starts filming on the cult series tomorrow.
"It is exciting, really exciting to be part of one of the biggest shows in the world," Booth said. "I have been overwhelmed by the number of fans who have wished me well and who are super-excited for me to join the cast. This show really does have a huge following."
Booth said her involvement in Blue Murder: Killer Cop was all about being in the right place at the right time.
"I was in Australia when the opportunity to do Blue Murder came up, and obviously I jumped at the chance," she said.
"I love working in Australia, it is home."
