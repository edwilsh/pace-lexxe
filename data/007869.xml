  <title>CCTV footage shows arson at Eddie Obeid-linked Bankstown function centre</title>
  <content>
Police have called for public assistance to identify two men wanted over separate arson attacks on a building linked to the family of disgraced former NSW MP Eddie Obeid.
The men were caught on CCTV deliberately lighting a fire at the Bellevue Reception Centre in Bankstown, in Sydney's south west.

The centre operates from a building owned by a company whose director is Paul Obeid, Eddie Obeid's son.
Eddie Obeid, who is currently serving a prison sentence for his family's secret business dealings, is listed as a former director of the company.
Police also want information about a black Ford utility also caught on CCTV at the time of the first attack on Boxing Day 2016.
A second attack occurred eight days later.
On Wednesday, Detective Superintendent Murray Chapman said a development application had been lodged for the building, which incurred serious damage in the arson attacks.
Detective Chapman said future plans for the building were being taken into account.
"We are aware of a development application for that site; it's one of a number of lines of inquiry... we can't rule out," he said.
"The strike force has made significant progress and we believe we are getting close to identifying the offenders involved."
