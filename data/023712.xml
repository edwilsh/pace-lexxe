  <title>Cousin of buck's party soldier also dies</title>
  <content>
A man who died after an attack near a Melbourne train station has been named as the cousin of soldier Natasha Rowley, found dead after a Victorian buck's night.
Melbourne man Marcus Rowley has been named by his family as the victim of a Saturday night attack in West Footscray, for which another man has been arrested.
Fairfax Media on Monday reported Mr Rowley returned from the funeral of Ms Rowley, found dead after a Melbourne buck's night last month, just days before the attack.
