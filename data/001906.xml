  <title>'Come inside': Reporter's insane live cross</title>
  <content>
A TURKISH television reporter proved her commitment to the task at hand when she continued a live weather report despite being pelted with hail stones.
"I apologise to our viewers, I can barely stand up. A huge hailstorm is hitting Istanbul ... I feel the pain of the hail on my body ... I have difficulties walking ... huge hail stones are hitting us.
Ice is hitting us on the head," the reporter says, according to a YouTube translation.
She's handed an umbrella, which she abandons within seconds as she continues to get pummelled by the extreme weather.
Safe in the studio, the news anchor pleads with the reporter to abandon the live cross and seek safety.
"Just give us pictures. Please get somewhere safe. If you can hear me, come inside. We only need to see the weather. I can even hear the sound from the studio - we are really talking about huge hail stones."
Umm, we hope she's not still out there?
