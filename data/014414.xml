  <title>Biofuel machine turns seeds to diesel</title>
  <content>
Victorian trials have used mustard seeds
A machine which turns seeks into diesel fuel has been unveiled in the South Australian town of Tailem Bend.
The machine, which has been trialled in Victoria over the last four using mustard seed, can deliver 150 litres of fuel per hour from excess soya beans or canola.
It has been developed by South Australian Biofuels, which will charge a fee per litre of fuel produced.
Enginnering manager Morgan Hunter said the idea of the machine was that it would decentralise the fuel cycle for farmers, who could turn excess product into fuel.
Hunter claims the machine has ten times the power of competing solutions.
