  <title>ACT Health infrastructure audit found more than 100 'high risks' in ageing assets, including hospital switchboard</title>

An audit of ACT Health assets across Canberra found more than 100 "high risks" in the directorate's infrastructure in 2016, including an "extreme risk" linked to the Canberra Hospital's ageing main switchboard.

But Speaker Joy Burch rejected that claim in June, on the basis of official legal advice from an independent arbiter who assessed Mr Barr's claim, Keith Mason QC.
Ultimately, the ACT Health Infrastructure Asset Condition Report and minor works priorities was tabled in the legislative assembly on Tuesday afternoon.
It detailed some 143 "high risks" associated with ageing infrastructure assets across the hospital, including four extreme risks, with serious concerns about the hospital's main switchboard and ageing helipad.
Consultants assessed the condition of more than 30 ACT Health-owned buildings across Canberra, including both public hospitals, health centres and student accommodation in Belconnen, Garran and Philip.

The assessment found "600 issues" across all ACT Health assets, many of which were rated low or medium risks.
It also found the cost of rectifying all "minor works" came to $71.1 million at Canberra Hospital, $32.4 million at Calvary Public Hospital and $2.7 million at "all other sites".

The Canberra Times understands urgent electrical works were completed in the wake of the fire, and a was issued days after the incident.
A $1.2 million contract was also awarded in August last year to replace the hospital's ageing helipad with a new one, works meant to be completed by December this year.
The main switchboard caught fire during maintenance works earlier this year, causing about 60 people to be evacuated from the hospital and surgeries to be cancelled, prompting the Opposition's motion to have the AECOM report tabled.
Opposition health spokeswoman Vicki Dunne said Health Minister Meegan Fitzharris had to "tell the community what she is doing to fix our decaying hospital, particularly with regard to the sub-standard switchboards and helipad".
"Ever since Ms Fitzharris was appointed Health Minister, she has repeatedly claimed she wasn't told about a range of critical issues such as infrastructure risks that led to the hospital switchboard fire in April, long-standing poor data integrity and failures to complete reviews," she said.
"I am calling on the Minister to keep the Assembly informed of progress on fixing the 147 extreme and high risks that the AECOM report has identified at The Canberra Hospital."
Comment was sought from Ms Fitzharris' office prior to filling this story.
