  <title>Police release Sydney terror plotter without charge</title>
  <content>
One-of-four men arrested over an alleged terror plot to bring down a plane has been released without charge.
Federal police have spent days rifling through several properties across Sydney following the arrest on Saturday afternoon of the men on suspicion of being behind the conspiracy.
A 50-year-old man was released from police custody about 7pm on Tuesday without being charged with a criminal offence, a joint statement from the AFP and NSW Police said on Wednesday.
The remaining three suspects will stay in detention under special powers which allow police to hold them for up to a week.
"This investigation remains ongoing, and further information will be provided at an appropriate time," the statement said.
The alarming plot allegedly involved an improvised device and the target was a plane, with one theory suggesting the would-be terrorists planned to use a meat grinder to conceal their home-made device.
Professor Greg Barton, a terrorism expert at Deakin University, says the suspects may have been directed by handlers in Syria.
"My speculative guess is they were probably trained in how to prepare TATP," he told AAP.
The chemical, which was used in the Manchester Arena bombing in May and also in Paris in the 2015 attacks, is unstable but can be powerful when placed in a pressure vessel.
Prof Barton said it also didn't produce "tell-tale" signs picked up at airport swab tests and would have appeared opaque under an X-ray.
"There's a chance if someone had a hand-turned sausage grinder that's not electric, it was packed so it didn't rattle, and had a plausible story that they were asked to bring it back as a gift, that might just be plausible enough for it to slip through."
While Prof Barton said the conspiracy was "clearly the most sophisticated terror plot" Australia had ever seen, it likely would have failed because the bomb may have been stopped at security, failed to detonate or failed to bring an aircraft down.
Meanwhile, Etihad Airways on Tuesday confirmed it was helping Australian authorities with the investigation amid reports the arrests were made after a tip-off from foreign intelligence services.
News agency Reuters cited a US official as saying the plot was "fairly well along".
Police have until Sunday to charge the men before they are released, however, it's understood detectives might be able to apply for further detention provisions.
