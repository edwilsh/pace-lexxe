  <content>
An Adelaide chiropractor has been granted bail after being charged with indecently filming his clients.
The man, who can't be identified, appeared in the Adelaide Magistrates Court on Friday and was released on home detention bail with strict conditions including a requirement for him to lodge $40,000 in cash with the court.
The court heard he had allegedly filmed people while they were undressing and ordered him to appear again on October 10.
