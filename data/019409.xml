  <title>World Athletics Championships 2017: Lapierre misses out in long jump</title>
  <content>
Fabrice Lapierre prided himself on his inconsistency. No matter how a meet was going he always knew he was always capable of pulling anything out.
Two years ago in Beijing at the last world championships that glorious capacity for inconsistency saw him win a silver medal.
This year Lapierre could not find the consistency he needed. Each of his three jumps were within four centimetres of one another and a long way short of what he needed to pressure the leaders
Lapierre's best jump was 7.93, his worst 7.29m. None of which was good enough to keep him in a final eight where every other jumper cleared eight metres.
South Africa won gold and bronze in the long jump, split by an American Jarrion Lawson who with his last jump of the night fell just 4 cms shy of gold medallist Luvo Manyonga with 8.48m
Lawson was in silver with 8.44 and Ruswahl Samaai in bronze with 8.32m.
Earlier Ethiopia's Almaz Ayana won by almost an entire lap to win the 10,000m gold in 30:16.32. Australia's Eloise Wellings finished 22nd in a season's best 32:26.31while Maddie Hills was 26th in 32:48.57.
