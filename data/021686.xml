  <title>Stunning photos show what it's like inside a Chinese factory that makes toys to sell to the rest of the world</title>

NEW YORK CITY - China makes much of what the world buys. According to , the country was producing 25% of the globe's manufacturing output by value in 2015.

In 2013, when Cheng Cheng - currently an intern on Business Insider's graphics team - was a photography student in London, she had the idea to produce a body of work that would visualise mass production. Hailing from the Jiangsu province of China, she decided the place she came from would be the best place to do it.

Inside a toy factory in the Jiangsu province, she saw workers handcrafting stuffed-animal versions of characters whose faces they do not recognise.

"It's cliche [to] talk about 'made in China,' but because it's my hometown I have an emotional connection with that," she told Business Insider.

Here's what she saw of the workers' day-to-day routines.
