  <title>Storm swansong for Hoffman?</title>
  <content>
MELBOURNE Storm is quietly confident about Ryan Hoffman returning to the club next season.
Storm officials have held talks with Hoffman, 33, about a possible comeback after New Zealand Warriors informed the veteran a new contract would not be forthcoming.
The 301-game second-rower made 245 appearances at Storm between 2003-10 and 2012-14 including three Grand Final wins.
Storm football director Frank Ponissi confirmed club officials had met with Hoffman about a potential swansong season.

"Without giving away too much, we've certainly had conversations with Ryan about finishing his career here and that is a possibility," Ponissi told the Herald Sun.
"He's got some other offers at the moment, which he's considering, but we're certainly having a chat.
"It's still very ... early days, he has got a couple of other options that he's considering but it would be great to get him back."
Hoffman averaged 96.6 metres and 26 tackles a game before he damaged his ankle in the pre-game for Round 17.
The 14-time NSW Origin representative has attracted interest from Sydney NRL clubs and French powerhouse Catalans, despite not having played for six weeks.

But Storm must be considered a frontrunner for Hoffman, who remains a much-loved figure among players, coaches, officials and fans.
Hoffman travelled to Melbourne last month to help celebrate Storm captain and premiership teammate Cameron Smith's 350th game.
Hoffman's tally at the Warriors stands at 56 games including 23 as captain, but his papers were stamped early in the year when the club signed prized Storm utility Tohu Harris.
If successful, signing Hoffman would help Storm offset the experience set to be lost next season with the departures of Harris, Jordan McLean (Nth Queensland) and Cooper Cronk.
While adding depth, Hoffman could also fast-track the development of exciting second-rowers Felise Kaufusi and young gun Joe Stimson.
