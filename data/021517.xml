  <content>
Dapto Chiefs caused the upset of the season with a 5-0 shut out of Illawarra premiers Wests Cardinals.

Chiefs' win was on the back of a complete game from pitcher Tim Inglis, who threw 98 pitches for seven strike outs, just three hits and just one walk.

Their defence was perfect, making no errors to Cardinals' two.
Veteran Chiefs' batter Troy Green hit four from five, including a double and two runs batted in, and was supported by shortstop Craig Leighton's 2-5 that started a three-run fifth inning with his single to left field.

In defeat, Cards will welcome back their MLB academy representative Alex Osborne next round who has spent the last 10 days training on the Gold Coast. 
Meanwhile, at Fred Finch Park, Northern Pirates and Berkeley Eagles staged a 12 innings pitchers duel that finished in a 2-all draw after time ran out.

Pirates' starter Dylan Rower matched his Eagles counterpart Blake Barnard, with both going the first seven innings with Eagles holding a slim 2-1 lead.
A costly error from the Eagles' third base in the top of the ninth resulted in Bobby Twedt levelling it up, after his lead off double, against reliever Tim Atherton, started the inning the best way possible for the Bucs.

Neither side could break the deadlock with Pirates' reliever Lachlan Crawley solid in his five innings, while Barnard was required to pitch the final two innings for his side with their usual closer Atherton dominant in three innings pitched for one hit, six strike outs and one unearned run.
