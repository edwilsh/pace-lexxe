  <title>BOM: Why a warm winter does not equal hot a summer</title>
  <content>
JULY might have been particularly balmy compared to past years but that doesn't mean summer will be a stinker, forecasters say.

The last month didn't break any Ipswich winter records but the average maximum temperature was consistently above the long term average of 22.9.

While winter was warm, Bureau of Meteorology forecasters say it's too soon to match that with a super hot summer.

"It didn't break any records but the average July maximum is  22.9 so it was 1.7 above the long term average," BOM forecaster David Crock said.

"Along with the rest of the state is was well above average and unseasonably warm.

"It's hard to say too much about what it means for summer  but the three month prediction shows warmer than average temperatures."

Friday, Saturday and Sunday are expected to be fine and sunny with maximums of 25 degrees throughout the weekend.
