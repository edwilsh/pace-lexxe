exit
COOTAMUNDRA MP Katrina Hodgkinson has announced her shock resignation, forcing the electorate into a by-election. 

Issuing a statement at 4pm on Monday, Ms Hodgkinson said it had been an honour to serve the Riverina. 

While details remain scarce, she said her decision was not one based on a single issue - rather her "length of service". 
The Nationals parliamentarian thanked her husband Jack for his support throughout nearly two decades of public life - and her wonderful children, Georgia and Hamilton, who have known her as an "MP Mum".

This makes her the fourth party member to announce their exit from parliament this year, following Duncan Gay, and Thomas George and Kevin Humphries who will retire at the 2019 election.
