  <title>The Internet Reacts To Game Of Thrones Sea</title>
  <content>
Another week, another tweetstorm, and it's time to see what the Internet thinks about the latest episode of Game of Thrones. Jump on in to go once more through the emotional roller coaster of Game of Thrones season 7, episode 3: The Queen's Justice.

The Mother of Recaps is back for another week. And with an episode title like that, we know it's going to be juicy. Maybe even literally. Who knows what Cersei is capable of at this stage?

This week's episode opened, like all of them, in Dragonstone. Predictably a lot of fans were pretty excited about Daenerys and Jon Snow finally meeting, but more people were caught up on the way they were introduced...

Missandei: You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn...
*1hr later*
Ser Davos: Dis jon snow...
Jon Snow:
- M E L O D Y (@themelodyly)

Jon Snow listening to Daenerys introduction be like:
- David Andino (@onidnadivad)

Others were mad at Daenerys for being so stubborn about the fate of the continent she wants to rule.

Like.....folks believe in dragons, but the army of the dead is too much? Y'all fuckin annoying.
- Eurahoe Greyjoy (@Parkour_Lewis)

But did anyone else find that scene just a little... boring?

Dany meeting Jon Snow for the first time just feels like the most boring Facebook argument ever.
- Hayley Prime 4 (@_HayleyElise)

Down in King's Landing, Cersei is playing the Mad Queen in the best possible way. You can't help but cheer for her even if you hate her guts.

Cersei made a compelling scene involving Ellaria Sand and the remaining Sand Snake. That's how good her character is.
- Lucy Steigerwald (@LucyStag)

CERSEI IS NOT A LIKABLE CHARACTER
that being, i found so much enjoyment watching her get revenge on Ellaria Sand üòàüëåüèΩ

Back to Dragonstone, Jon plans his future career as a miner.

Jon Snow, on next weeks episode of .
- Rhaegar Targaryen (@RhaegarTheAndal)

Meanwhile, we're still wondering... where's this guy at?

Where is the Night King?
- Azi Heron (@AziHeron)

Back at Winterfell, we get another character meeting (well, reunion) that's been anticipated for a long time. Turns out it's just as underwhelming as the Jon and Dany one.

So you thought that Bran could not get more boring ? You thought that all that walking around in snow had a purpose ?
- r-T (@rT28250462)

At least she is not Rickon.
- 9GAG (@9GAG)

Jon Snow: Undead
Bran: Emotionless Vegetable
Arya: Wears people's flayed faces
Sansa at the reunion:
- Liam McCormack (@_Liam_McCormack)

Sansa: Who are you?
Bran: The Three Eyed Raven.
Sansa:Who are you?
Arya: No one.
Sansa:Has everyone lost their minds?
- The Great Comedy (@TheGreatComedy1)

But honestly we're all just waiting for this guy to get out of the way.

I watch every new episode of Game of Thrones in the hope that it's the one where Littlefinger dies.
- Adam üêª‚öæÔ∏èüíôüôè (@BornHeel)

Over in the Citadel luckily Sam is finally done with grossing us out. This time he's just teaching people that reading the instructions is how to get things done.

Sam is the one guy who actually reads Terms&Conditions.
- Arya Stark üê∫ (@Arya_No1)

Jorah, after sleeping off his terminal case of greyscale, is ready to go back to his Khaleesi.

Archmaester: Ser Jorah how did you get rid of that Chlamydia?
Ser Jorah: a little rest and the climate!
- Jamie Jameson (@Puck_Incarnate)

Jorah Mormont on his way to get  friend zoned

A lot of the scenes in this episode had people a little confused, but none more than the ambitious attack on Casterly Rock. With Grey Worm and Euron making it all the way to the other side of Westeros, and Arya not even reaching Winterfell yet, a lot of fans are bewildered by the pacing of this season.

HOW DOES ANY OF THIS MAKE SENSE
- Hayley Prime 4 (@_HayleyElise)

But seriously how can Euron go to Casterly Rock so fast?
- Myrcella Baratheon (@SweetMyrcella)

Me trying to figure out how Jon made it to Dany, but Arya still hasn't made it to Winterfell    
- Emily (@ecostello94)

Waiting for the arrival of Arya in Winterfell like:
- carm (@ehicarm)

Others were disappointed by the scale of the battle itself...

I feel like in any other season, the Casterly Rock sequence would've been 6+ minutes long. We just got a glorified montage
- Laura Brown (@lcbrown91)

Or just by the scale of the castle.

Casterly Rock: Expectation vs Reality
- selkie (@__valfoy)

But this is quickly forgotten in the face of Olenna Tyrell exiting the series in style.

Can we just talk about the fact that she üëèwas üëèthe üëèreal MVP üëèüò≠ ü§ß
- Nuria   üçÄ (@nurialds16)

Olenna at the end of that episode tho
- Maddie J Marsh (@MaddieJayMarsh)

Olenna's last words had me like
- Alex Helen Reid (@alexpractice89)

All you need to know about last night's Game of Thrones.
- Ashley (@MoreThanAMilSO)

Olenna: I'd hate to die like your son.. tell cersei i want her to know it was me
- CKAS (@cdkrstlannnn)

Only Olenna Tyrel would still be able to beat Jaime in the middle of her own death scene. Slay, Olenna, slay.
- Zachary Burgess (@RealZachBurgess)

Seriously, we didn't see her die on screen so this can still definitely happen.

If next week's  doesn't open with this I'm done with it.
