  <title>Nelson Bay Road upgrade continues but $70m 'not enough'</title>
  <content>
Hopes that Nelson Bay Road would receive funds for the full duplication in this term of government have been dashed.
While work is about to start on an upgrade to a roundabout at Willamtown a scoping study has revealed the state government's $70 million is well short of the mark.

Scot MacDonald
"The $70 million stands and we will roll that out and the roundabout is part of it," the Parliamentary Secretary for the Hunter Scot MacDonald said.
"[But] I've now got to go to the Premier [Gladys Berejiklian] and the Roads Minister [Melinda Pavey] to ask for more money."
Ms Berejiklian's predecessor Mike Baird visited Port Stephens at the 2015 state government election to pledge $70 million to the duplication.
Before that, at , Mr MacDonald said any more work would depend on the long term lease of the state's poles and wires network that's since happened.
For the past two budgets Port Stephens voters were told that .
Mr MacDonald received that study this week.
"It will be three to four times that [$70 million] figure," he said.
"I've been taken aback by it, the scale of what's needed in this comprehensive study, we now understand the scale of what's required.
"I've now got something concrete to go in to bat for."
The roundabout upgrade at the corner of Medowie and Nelson Bay roads is part of a $6 million allocation.
The works will include a double right turn from Medowie Road, west towards Newcastle as well as extended approach and departure lanes on the eastern side of the roundabout to improve roundabout performance.

Part of the $6 million will be spent on design work to upgrade the intersection of Nelson Bay Road and Lemon Tree Passage Road.
Mr MacDonald said the RMS undertook a comprehensive corridor study for Nelson Bay Road in 2016.

HAPPIER TIMES: At the opening of the last stage of the Nelson Bay Road upgrade in May 2015 were Cr Sally Dover, Scot MacDonald, Maitland mayor Peter Blackmore, Port Stephens MP Kate Washington and then Roads Minister Duncan Gay.
That study highlighted a "significant increase in freight and light vehicle traffic" between Newcastle and Williamtown Airport.
The priority, he said, will be to continue the duplication between Fern Bay and the Airport to address the significant increases in freight and traffic.
"The NSW Government will continue to deliver projects as part of the $70 million upgrade and I will be making representations to the Premier,Treasurer and Roads Minister regarding the full scope of works," Mr MacDonald said.
"I anticipate working with Hunter Regional Organisation of Councils, Port Stephens Council, Chambers of Commerce, the RAAF and the community to build support and a strong case for the NSW Government to consider."

The NSW Government is currently investing in a number of priority projects in the Hunter including:
·         $391 million M1 Pacific Motorway Productivity Package
·         $280 million Newcastle Inner City Bypass
·         Newcastle Light Rail and the new Newcastle Interchange
·         $120 million New England Highway Scone Bypass
·         $12 million for replacement of the New Engalnd Highway rail bridge at Gowrie Gates
·         $5 million for planning the M1 to Raymond Terrace upgrade
·         $1.7 million for upgrading the M1, John Renshaw Drive and Weakleys Drive Intersection
·         $5.4 million for Hunter Pinch Points
·         $23.4 million for the 3.8km duplication of Tourle Street and Cormorant Road.

MORE TO COME.
