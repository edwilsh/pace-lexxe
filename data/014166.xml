  <content>
A FEMALE postal worker has been attacked by a man as she delivered letters on her motorcycle in Midland.
The postie, 71, was delivering the mail on Templeman Place when she was allegedly assaulted at about 1.30pm.
She passed a man who was walking along the street then travelled down Cooper Street before returning to Templeman Place, heading north.
The man then approached her and caused her to stop, before pushing her, causing her to fall on a fence.
While she was on the ground, the attacker kicked her several times before running off along Templeman Place.
The postie was taken to St John of God Hospital in Midland.
Police were unable to locate the man, who was described as being in his 20s, tall, with tanned skin, unshaven and wearing a black hoodie.
Anyone who can assist in this investigation is asked to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or make a report online at
