  <title>Commission of inquiry into PNG election top priority for opposition</title>
  <content>
PNG's new parliamentary opposition says one of its first actions will be to push for a commission of inquiry into the conduct of the recent national elections.
Peter O'Neill was re-elected Prime Minister on the floor of parliament yesterday with the support of 60 MPs and 46 opposing.
That's a much smaller majority than when he was elected PM after the 2012 election by 94 parliamentarians.
One of the leaders on the opposition side is Kerenga Kua, who says the opposition is in a much stronger position.
He tells Liam Fox that one of their first priorities will be a demand for a thorough examination of the electoral process.
