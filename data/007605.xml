  <title>McGoverns a mouthwatering Freo prospect</title>
  <content>
HOW would two McGovern brothers look in Fremantle's starting 18?
It's a distinct possibility in the near future, according to Fox Footy's Anthony Hudson.
Adelaide's Mitch McGovern looms as one of the most-wanted out-of-contract players should he remain unsigned by the Crows at season's end.
The 22-year-old only served to enhance his stocks with a remarkable pack mark and goal in the dying moments of last weekend's clash with Collingwood to help Adelaide salvage a draw.
McGovern saves the day

West Coast defender Jeremy is contracted to the Eagles until the end of next season.
But speaking about Mitch's future on SEN this morning, Hudson raised the prospect of the two brothers linking up at the Dockers from 2019.
"It was put to me yesterday that the idea is that he wants to play with his brother at Fremantle and that Jeremy will end up at Fremantle as well... in a couple of years' time, when (Jeremy) is out of contract," Hudson said.
"His dad, of course, used to play for Fremantle."
Andrew McGovern was an inaugural Docker who played 63 games for the club.
The McGovern brothers teaming up would be a mouth-watering prospect for any side, with speculation on Mitch's future set to intensify as he edges closer to coming out of contract.
