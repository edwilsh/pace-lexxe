The same-sex marriage issue is again threatening the stability of the Federal Government.
Conservatives are angry that some Liberals have not ruled out crossing the floor to force the lower house to debate the issue.
Yesterday Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said Liberal backbenchers have the right to cross the floor.
But some inside the party have privately warned Mr Turnbull fails to understand the process.
They argue there is a major difference between casting a conscience vote on an issue and supporting the Opposition to drive the parliamentary agenda.
Mr Turnbull's critics warn by crossing the floor, the small group of Liberals would be exposing that the Government has lost control of the House.
Senior ministers are insisting the Government policy is to have a plebiscite to ask voters to decide whether the law should be changed.
Employment Minister Michaelia Cash says the party will be sticking to its election commitment.
"Our policy as a government is very clear. Our policy is a plebiscite and we have no plans to change it," Senator Cash said.
and some Liberals are now arguing there is no point trying again.
But Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said the Coalition must stick to the plebiscite policy.
"The commitment hasn't expired, the commitment we took to the next election is that we would give the Australian people a say on whether or not the definition of marriage should change and that we would give people a say on a plebiscite," Senator Cormann told ABC RN.
Australian Marriage Equality, which has been lobbying to allow same-sex marriage, has welcomed the growing signs of support emerging from the Coalition.
"We thank Brisbane MP Trevor Evans and Senator Dean Smith and all the parliamentary supporters of marriage equality for their commitment to fairness, equality and resolving this issue in the parliament," the group's executive director Tiernan Brady said.
