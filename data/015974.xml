Bungala One under construction
Spanish group Elecnor has been awarded a $173 million contract to construct the second phase of the Bungala solar farm in South Australia.
Elecnor won the contract for Bungala One in April, and has already begun construction. The two phases will comprise over 437,000 solar panels and deliver a total of 275MW of capaciity.
A third phase is under development and will add 100MW, for a grand total of 374MW.
The South Australian plant, near the town of Port Augusta, will be built for the investment consortium comprising Enel Green Power and Dutch Infrastructure.
The plant is due to connect to the grid by early 2019, with Origin signing a purchase agreement.
Elecnor will build and operate the two projects for a period of five years after construction is completed.
