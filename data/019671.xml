As a Golden Rose campaign looked to end before it truly began for one runner, another promising three-year-old highlighted his bright future at Kembla Grange on Saturday. 
While Peter and Paul Snowden's Group 1 nominated Conquest failed to fire a shot, Super Ex was impressive snatching his maiden victory for trainer Mark Newnham. The Excites colt benefited from a slow speed to edge out Goldolphin's Catesby by a head as the leading pair put a gap of 5- 1/4 lengths on Conquest in third. 
"He has got the ability and will definitely go on with it," Super Ex's jockey Mitchell Bell said.
"He has got scope to be Saturday class. He will work through his grades as a mature horse next preparation."
Catesby ($3.40) was given an easy time in front, with Super Ex ($2 fav) poised at the James Cummings trained colt's side. When the pace went on in the straight, the leading duo quickly paired off to fight it out.

Super Ex lifted over the final strides to edge out his rival. 
"He was tough," Bell said.

"We only went steady and it didn't give much for what was behind us. I knew [Jeff Penza's ride Catesby] would sprint well off the slow speed and the blinkers on. He did that and left my horse a little bit flat-footed. But the further he got the better he got.
