  <title>Flash mob wish for young Melbourne boy</title>
  <content>
Young Victorian boy Eitan has been battling leukaemia for four years but now he just wants to dance, dance, dance.
The seven-year-old will star in a flash mob with hundreds of people at Melbourne's Federation Square on Wednesday as part of a charity wish.
After spending years in hospitals since the age of two, he wants to become a viral internet star and wants to "make new friends".
The dance to Justin Timberlake's Can't Stop The Feeling kicks off from 4pm.
People are encouraged to learn the dance, via a video on the Make-A-Wish website, or turn up and cheer Eitan on.
