THE Mooch may be headed to Hollywood.
Anthony Scaramucci wants to parlay his short-lived stardom as White House communications director into an acting gig, according to .
The gossip site reports that a major Hollywood producer has been in touch with Scaramucci to create a White House version of Spin City.
The two working titles for the sitcom or feature film are 10 Days in July and Attack of the Swamp Monsters, TMZ says.
The concept is an outsider storming to power in Washington, much to the consternation of longtime political hacks who try to strike back at him.
The Mooch flamed out as comms director when new White House Chief of Staff John Kelly ousted him after only 10 days in the wake of his profanity-laced conversation with a New Yorker reporter.

Despite his turbulent swing through the White House, Scaramucci has told  that he still considers his tenure a success.
He had planned to host an online event Friday to address the American people directly - but cancelled his appearance on Thursday afternoon.
