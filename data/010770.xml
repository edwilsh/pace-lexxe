  <title>Cocaine jelly found in passenger's luggage</title>
  <content>
An American man has been charged after allegedly being caught concealing a kilo of cocaine-laced petroleum jelly in his suitcase at Melbourne's airport.
The 21-year-old man arrived at Melbourne International Airport from Colombia on Tuesday and border force agents found a jelly-like substance, which authorities say contained one kilogram of cocaine, in his bag.
The man appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Wednesday charged with importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, and he is due to appear again on October 25.
