  <title>Currie St Crawl a success</title>
  <content>
NAMBOUR was the place to be and the place to be seen on Saturday, July 8, for the inaugural Currie St Music Crawl.
The main street was absolutely jam-packed with people, and it was standing room only as more than 20 musical acts played in five different local venues around town.
Local businesses were also buzzing with cafes and restaurants right up and down Currie St and beyond overflowing with people. On behalf of the Nambour community, I'd like to say a massive thank you to the outstanding team at Queensland Music Festival and the council for working together to make this event a spectacular success.
Bloomin' great
THAT second weekend in July was also very special for the Queensland Garden Expo that once again brought fantastic colour and life to the Nambour Showgrounds.
This was the event's 33rd year here and it's really amazing to think that what started as a single-day event with about 300 visitors in 1985 now brings more than 38,000 people through the gates. A big congratulations and thank you to event manager Marion Beazley and Peter Young for their continued efforts in making the garden expo such a great traditional showpiece for Nambour and the Sunshine Coast.
