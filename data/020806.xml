  <title>Kevin Conroy Steps Into Christian Bale's Batsuit For Iconic Dark Knight Speech</title>
  <content>
During his time starring in Batman: The Animated Series, and in the countless video games, direct-to-video movies and other spin-offs since then, Kevin Conroy has defined Batman's voice for an entire generation. Which is why it's such a delight to hear him become Christopher Nolan's own Dark Knight.

Over on Nerdist's Talkin' Toons, Conroy and fellow voice actor Rob Paulsen (Animaniacs, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) do a nice table read of the ending moments of Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, including Batman's speech about being the villain Gotham needs after the Joker's rampage. Also, like, not to be that person, but remember how Batman gave this whole speech about playing the villain and then promptly quit being Batman?

Way to go, Christopher Nolan.

You can check it out on . But we've also got to give props to YouTuber , who synced the recordings up with the actual footage from The Dark Knight. It might not be perfect, but it's Batman. He's already better than perfect.
