  <title>Terror raids timed to boost polls</title>
  <content>
A Labor politician has suggested the weekend's terror raids were part of a Federal Government conspiracy to boost its standing in the polls.
The Northern Territory's Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence and Women's Policy, Sandra Nelson, made the accusation on Twitter while watching the ABC's Q and A program on Monday night.
'Polling for LNP not good,' she tweeted. 'Therefore we now have a 'terrorist attack'. How convenient. #QandA.'
Pressed on her comments by freelance photojournalist Ted McConnell she doubled down, saying no-one could confirm anything about the terror raids, and that people were jumping on the bandwagon because the 'Neocons' said so.
But it was a more contrite Ms Nelson in an official statement sent to Sky News today.
She said she understood the threat of terrorism was real, and said she was sorry if her tweet suggested otherwise.
'I realise now that while it was a throwaway comment, it was a mistake, and insensitive to come across as flippant about an issue that concerns Australians.'
Ms Nelson is the niece of former East Timor president Jose Ramos Horta. She fled East Timor in 1975, arriving in Australia as a refugee.
Comment has been sought from Northern Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner.
