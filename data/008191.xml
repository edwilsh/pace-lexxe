  <title>Price labels Aussie golfers key to Cup success</title>
  <content>
GOLF: Nick Price will be looking to Jason Day and Adam Scott to lead from the front at next month's Presidents Cup to break the International team's drought in the competition against the Americans.
The Australian stars have slipped down the world rankings and remain winless in 2017 but they remain the second and third best players on the International team behind Japan's Hideki Matsuyama.
World No.3 Hideki Matsuyama will spearhead the International challenge in the Presidents Cup.
Captain Price said both need to be at their best if his team is to taste victory for only the second time since 1998.
"The top five on our team haven't played their best in recent months," Price said ahead of this weekend's World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational
"So hopefully they'll start really getting their games into shape now.
"There's so much to play for between now and the Presidents Cup. They just need that little bit of momentum going into that week."
Price and assistant captain Ernie Els are the only members of the extended 2017 Internationals team who have played on a winning Presidents Cup team.
The Presidents Cup takes place at New Jersey's Liberty National from September 26.
