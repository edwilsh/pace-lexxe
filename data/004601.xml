  <title>Super sisters lop long locks to help sick kids</title>
  <content>
MT MARTHA sisters Milija, 10, and Arija, 9, are boasting stylish bobs after sacrificing their long hair to help other kids in need.
The pair decided to cut their hair and donate it to create wigs for children who have lost their hair due to a medical condition.
They are also hoping the initiative will help them raise $3000 for Variety.
The Mt Martha Primary students have collected $1720 via their Everydayhero fundraising page and are hoping to collect the remaining $1280 in the coming months.
"Wigs cost families up to $6000, lasting up to two years, meaning families can spend tens of thousands of dollars on the purchase of wigs," the girls' page stated.
The pair had their hair cut at Silk, Mt Martha, last Wednesday.
Mum Jenny said she was proud of the girls.
"They were really excited to make a difference," she said.
