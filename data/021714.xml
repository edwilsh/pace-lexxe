  <title>Heartache behind Guy's extreme transformation</title>
  <content>
IT IS a whole new Guy.
His body transformation has had the whole country talking and now The Daily Telegraph can reveal the images from Guy Sebastian's Men's Health Australia cover shoot.
The award-winning singer has revealed to the magazine he was on a downward spiral when he decided to embark on a health kick.
"I was drinking too much. I wasn't eating well. And everything I thought I was doing right wasn't working," Sebastian said.
For years the father of two said he tried to shrug-off comments about his body.
"As a guy you pretend it doesn't affect you. But it does," he said.
, the singer started the new "it" ketogenic diet which drastically reduced his carb intake.
"Early on, Jules and I went through one week where we were disgustingly hungry and whining about it," he said.
"But that passes. I don't obsess about food anymore."
