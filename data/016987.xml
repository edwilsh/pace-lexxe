  <title>Pies great's $5m pitch for big Roo chase</title>

COLLINGWOOD premiership captain Tony Shaw says the Magpies should attempt to lure North Melbourne spearhead Ben Brown with a big-money, long-term deal.
The 24-year-old is among the contenders for the Coleman Medal, having booted 51 goals this year.
While the Pies have been linked to a move for Sydney tall Sam Reid, Shaw said his former side was better off looking to Brown.
"If I was going to spend money, Sam Reid - would I spend a million dollars on Sam Reid? No way known - because he's injury prone, inconsistent, plays well when his contract comes up a lot, Sam Reid," Shaw said on 3AW Radio.
"The other one around - and he's still got one more year (on his) contract, is Ben Brown.
"Now they're thinking about giving him more.
"I think Ben Brown - if I was Collingwood - I'd go out and offer Ben Brown a million dollars."
Shaw said the combination of Brown's age, room for improvement and demonstrated ability to perform in a struggling side made him the perfect target.
"I'd offer him a million dollars for five years because he's 25 in November, he's shown (he can perform) in a side that's struggled and maybe not great ball movement to get it in their forward line," he said.
"He's shown he can perform in a side that struggles - and he's improving. Wayne Carey says there's a lot of improvement because he's improved things that he (knew) he had to but he's got other things he can improve on.
"I reckon a million dollars is under the ante for five years of a player of his ilk and it's what Collingwood needs to allow Moore and other players around him - Fasolo, Elliot, those types to become better players."

When posed the possibility of North Melbourne offering Brown a contract in the region of $700,000, Shaw said the Pies should look to blow that out of the water.
"$700 (thousand) in the next? Well I'd be just knocking on his door, just saying 'son, here's a million a year for five years, just come over, baby,'" Shaw said.
While Josh Kelly has been valued at up to $1.5m per season, Collingwood great said he'd pay Brown that sort of money before the Giants midfielder.
"I'd be paying $1.5 for Ben Brown before Josh Kelly any day because he's a key position player and goal kicker," he said.
"It's what your club needs, too, isn't it? Someone needs a midfielder like Kelly, they'll pay.
"But $1.5 (million) for Kelly, that's crazy."
