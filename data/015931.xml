  <title>The business week in numbers</title>
  <content>
Origin cranks out the petajoules, Vodafone finds new friends, the new housing market isn't cooling, Rio's record and Crown's post-crackdown cracker - here's a taste of the numbers that mattered this week.
MONDAY
323 petajoules - Origin Energy lifted full-year oil and gas production by 40 per cent to 323 petajoules, helped by the ramp-up of operations at its Australia Pacific LNG project and better-than-expected output from its conventional oil and gas business.
TUESDAY
190,000 - The nation's third-ranked telco, Vodafone Hutchison Australia added 190,000 new customers to lift its subscriber base to 5.7 million, while reporting EBITDA of $477 million in the six months to June 30, up 15.9 per cent from a year ago.
WEDNESDAY
10.9% - The ABS said approvals for new home construction spiked 10.9 per cent in June, featuring a 20 per cent surge in the 'other dwellings' category - apartment blocks and townhouses - suggesting the housing market is still far from cool.
THURSDAY
$US1.10 - Rio Tinto's record dividend of $US1.10 per share - about $US2 billion in total - followed a 93 per cent increase in half-year profit, courtesy of stronger iron ore and coal prices.
FRIDAY
96.7% - Crown Resorts' full-year profit lifts 96.7 per cent to $1.9 billion, thanks to a $1.6 billion gain mainly from the sale of its share in the former Macau joint-venture Melco Resorts & Entertainment, but VIP highroller turnover falls 48.9 per cent in the wake of China's gambling crackdown.
