  <title>FC Barcelona confirms Neymar's departure to Paris Saint Germain</title>

Brazilian striker Neymar is leaving FC Barcelona, with the club confirming the news on Twitter on Wednesday.

The Brazilian striker left the training ground minutes after speaking to the team, it said.
It comes after Neymar signed a new Barcelona contract to 2021 in October, in which his buy-out clause was raised to 222 million euros ($US263 million).

Neymar Jr hasn't trained on Wednesday with the permission of the coach

Barcelona tweeted shortly after the radio report that Neymar, who has been with the Spanish club since June 2013, did not train on Wednesday "with the permission of the coach."
In another Twitter posting restricted to the sports press, the club said he was leaving but gave no further details.
Neymar signed for Barcelona from Brazilian side Santos for 57.1 million euros, although it was later revealed the cost was closer to 100 million euros.
