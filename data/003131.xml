  <title>STOCKS FINISH MIXED: Here's what you need to know</title>
  <content>
Stocks finished mixed as earnings season pressed on amid gradually improving economic data.

The S&P 500 was little changed, while the Dow gained 0.4% and the Nasdaq lost 0.4%. The Nasdaq, heavily weighted toward mega-cap tech stocks, proved once again that it's capable of having a mind of its own in going against the broader indices.

Meanwhile, recently-IPOed social media startup Snap had a volatile first day of trading following the expiration of its first post-offering share lock-up.

First up, the scoreboard:

Dow: 21,908.79, +78.48, (+0.36%)

S&P 500: 2,471.75, -0.36, (-0.01%)

Nasdaq: 6,348.90, -26.15, (-0.41%)

US 10-year yield: 2.29%, +0.003

WTI crude oil: $US50.24, +0.53, +1.07%
