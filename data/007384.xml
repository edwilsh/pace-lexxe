  <title>Charge upgraded over sword attack</title>
  <content>
A MAN accused of attacking a police officer with a samurai sword will have one of his charges upgraded when he appears in court on Wednesday.
Milos Radovic, 45, had been remanded in custody after being charged over the incident last month and will appear in court again on Wednesday.
On Wednesday morning, WA Police advised that a charge of intent to maim by unlawful wounding will be upgraded to the more serious charge of attempt to unlawfully kill.
The officer was attacked with a samurai sword in an incident at a Parkin Street house just before 5.30pm on July 19.
Police had been responding to a family violence incident between a man and a woman.
The officer was left with a deep head wound and taken by ambulance to Royal Perth Hospital.
He lost a litre of blood and needed more than 25 stitched to the head wound.
