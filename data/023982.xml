  <title>Netflix made its 'first ever' acquisition by buying Mark Millar's comic book publisher</title>
  <content>
Netflix has acquired comic book publisher Millarworld in its "first ever" acquisition, the company announced Monday.

The brainchild of comic book creator Mark Millar, Millarworld has been responsible for characters and storylines like Kick-Arse, Kingsman, and Old Man Logan, all of which have been made into major studio films in recent years.

Netflix and Millar are now teaming up to bring his characters and new content to the service in the form of Netflix-exclusive projects.

"Mark has created a next-generation comics universe, full of indelible characters living in situations people around the world can identify easily with," said Netflix chief content office Ted Sarandos in a statement. "We look forward to creating new Netflix Originals from several existing franchises as well as new super-hero, anti-hero, fantasy, sci-fi and horror stories Mark and his team will continue to create and publish."

Though Netflix has not disclosed the terms of the acquisition, Millar said in a statement that "this is only the third time in history a major comic book company has been purchased at this level."

While Netflix does not release its viewership numbers, the acquisition of Millarworld seems to signal that its four current Marvel Comic shows ("Luke Cage," "Jessica Jones," "Iron Fist" and "Daredevil") have performed well with the streaming service's audience.

Millar previously spent eight years as a writer at Marvel, where he developed the comic book story arcs that inspired the first "Avengers" movie, "Captain America: Civil War," and "Logan."
