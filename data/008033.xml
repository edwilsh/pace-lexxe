  <title>Billy Brownless has never been this angry</title>

BILLY Brownless isn't taking Patrick Dangerfield's suspension too well.
The Geelong star yesterday accepted a one-match ban for a dangerous tackle on Carlton's Matthew Kreuzer on the weekend, meaning he is ineligible to win his second successive Brownlow Medal.
The 27-year-old was essentially in a two-horse race with Richmond's Dustin Martin to take out the top gong in footy, but Geelong refused to challenge his suspension and risk rubbing the gun midfielder out for two weeks.
Footy Show personality Brownless - who played nearly 200 games for the Cats - lost his mind over Dangerfield's ban and unleashed an extraordinary rant on radio on Tuesday afternoon.
"Patrick Dangerfield is a national treasure, you know what the Match Review Panel (MRP) are? *****," Brownless said on Triple M Melbourne's The Rush Hour, which he co-hosts with James Brayshaw.
"Fair dinkum, they can all get f***ed. Last time I checked you're still allowed to tackle in our game. Last time I checked, it's still known as a contact sport. The last time I checked, in a contact sport, there's still a chance you're going to get hurt. Not according ot the f***wits running the MRP.
"He pins the arms - perfect tackle. He brings Kreuzer to the ground."
Brownless didn't stop when Brayshaw - laughing hysterically at his colleague's obviously over-the-top assault - tried to point out the Blues ruckman had already got rid of the ball when Dangerfield completed the tackle.
"Jim, if you f***ing interrupt me I'll knock your smug f***ing head right off," Brownless said.
"The rules that apply to the rest of the competition don't apply to Patty, it's that simple. If some list-clogger from another crap club knocks a bloke out with a tackle give him six weeks, no one gives a f***. This is Danger, the best player in the comp, he can do whatever the hell he likes.
"It's like I always say Jim ... I've forgotten what I always f***ing say.
"Jim, this is a disgrace. (Former VFL CEO) Ross Oakley, you can get f***ed.
"(Former AFL CEO) Wayne Jackson, (former football operations manager) Adrian Anderson, (former CEO Andrew) Demetriou, (former Brisbane Bears president) Paul f***ing Cronin, (former Hawthorn president) Jeff Kennett, you're all f***ing idiots.
"Patty is gold, he's an angel."
The rant, part of Brownless's regular "Billy's bake" segment, was obviously scripted and tongue-in-cheek (we think?), but that doesn't make it any less hilarious.
