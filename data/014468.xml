  <title>Homeless woman arrested over CBD hit run</title>
  <content>
A homeless woman has been arrested after a double hit-run in Melbourne's CBD.
Witnesses outside St Paul's Cathedral last night say an offending white car ran a red light, before allegedly striking a pedestrian and a cyclist at the intersection of Flinders and Swanston Streets about 6.30pm.
The white vehicle sped off, leaving the two men injured in the rain in the middle of the road.
Paramedics arrived quickly and assessed one of the men at the scene.
The other needed to be stabilised before being rushed via ambulance to Alfred hospital where he remains with non-life threatening injuries.
Three hours after the incident, at around 10pm, a woman of no fixed address was arrested along Flinders Lane near Elizabeth Street.
The 32-year-old was reportedly found close to the offending vehicle.
