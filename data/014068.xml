  <title>NSW dominate Jillaroos Merit team</title>
  <content>
A FEW months ago Jessica Sergis didn't even dare to dream of being a Jillaroo but a spectacular debut for NSW has seen her named in the Jillaroos Interstate Challenge Merit team ahead of the 2017 World Cup.
To the victor go the spoils with the triumphant NSW team at the recent challenge snatching 12 of the 17 spots in the inaugural Jillaroos Merit Team named on Friday.
Sergis, 19, thrust herself into the mix for the Jillaroos when she scored a try hat-trick on debut for NSW in their defence of the interstate challenge less than a fortnight ago.
At the time she said it was "a dream" just to be in the Blues, playing the sport she gave up promising careers in rugby and AFL for.
On Friday she was named as one of 12 Blues players honoured with Merit squad recognition, along with five Maroons.
Also named were Kezie Apps, who fought her way back from a serious leg and ankle injury sustained in February, veteran Ruan Sims and star Sam Bremner.
"Those in this Merit Team not only deserve to be named due to their on-field performance, but every one of them has gone above and beyond to include and embrace new audiences, fans and participants, particularly in the lead up to the Interstate Challenge," said Jillaroos coach Brad Donald.
"As a Jillaroos squad, which includes a majority of members from both Interstate Challenge teams, a representative from each Affiliated State, and a member of the victorious Australian Defence Force World Cup winning team, we now set our sights on preparing for the Rugby League World Cup.
"Whilst those who were named in the inaugural Merit Team deserve recognition, we refocus now as one team with one goal and that is to defend the World Cup on home soil."
The Jillaroos will come together in a camp next month with World Cup pool matches and semi-finals played at Southern Cross Group Stadium from November 16.
