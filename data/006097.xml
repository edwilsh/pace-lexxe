  <title>RSPCA seize 21 cats in property raid</title>
  <content>
TWENTY-ONE cats were seized by the RSPCA on Tuesday after inspectors raided a home in Victoria's northeast.
The cats, of varying age and sex, were found to be living in squalid conditions "detrimental" to their health.
They were transported to an RSPCA facility in Melbourne's southeast and treated for cat flu and fleas.
RSPCA inspectorate team leader Guy Gorman said the warrant was obtained following an earlier inspection of the Murrindindi property.
"Following our inspection, we concluded that the living conditions were detrimental to the cats' welfare," Mr Gorman said.
"Therefore, we sought and obtained court permission to enter the dwelling and seize animals determined to be at immediate risk with their welfare seriously compromised."
He said the cats were in immediate risk and their welfare was "seriously compromised".
Three RSPCA Victoria inspectors executed the warrant with help from Victoria Police and Murrindindi Council
