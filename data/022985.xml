  <title>David Hallberg's 'dark days' in Melbourne pay off for Australian Ballet</title>
  <content>
If you think this is a tough Melbourne winter, spare a thought for David Hallberg.
The world renowned ballet dancer - who cut his teeth at American Ballet Theatre before becoming the first American principal at the Bolshoi - spent all of last year (and then some) hiding away here in recovery from a busted ankle.Photo: Eddie Jim
"Those were very, very dark days," he says. "I didn't think I'd ever dance again."
After unsuccessfully trying to manage his injury, Hallberg returned to Australia where he had performed a few times as a guest of the Australian Ballet, and handed himself over to its physio team, head by Sue Mayes.Photo: Eddie Jim
"I had to turn off everything - I had to literally turn off social media and email. I shut my American phone down and focused solely on rehab," he says. "I didn't know it needed that until I came down here and it just called for all of my physical and mental stamina.
"Challenging" doesn't come close to describing what he felt during those 14 months, he says, but "they had absolute faith [in my recovery when] I had no faith".

A successful return to the New York stage earlier this year for ABT's spring season proved their faith was not misplaced. After a three-year absence, the 4000-strong audiences of the Metropolitan Opera House welcomed him back with open arms.

Hallberg describes his post-recovery comeback as a "rebirth". "It was a very emotional homecoming ... a big turn of the page," he says.Photo: Eddie Jim
In that time his profile has continued to rise, including landing lucrative advertising deals with Nike and Tiffany & Co.
Now he is back in his "second home", Melbourne, to give back to the company he credits with saving his career.
Hallberg will share the principal role with Australia's Kevin Jackson in the Australian Ballet's Symphony in C later this month. And, through his role as the company's inaugural international artist in residence, is mentoring its young dancers.
"They [the Australian Ballet] have given me such a gift, [which] I want to reciprocate as much as possible," he says.
With Symphony in C - an accessible, 40-minute tutu-romp by George Balanchine - Hallberg comes full circle. It was one of the first roles he performed as a young principal with ABT, 15 years ago.
"Revisiting the role, it feels very different - yet familiar," he says.
He approaches things differently now.
"I now know that I'm not invincible," he says. "I know how to maintain and condition my 'instrument'.
"I think through the lows you really get to know your true self."
The Australian Ballet's Symphony in C is on at the State Theatre, Arts Centre Melbourne, August 24 to September 2.
