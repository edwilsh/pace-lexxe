  <title>Carrum Downs family brews winning beer recipe</title>
  <content>
TECHNICALLY it's a lager, but don't expect an everyday drop when you taste Dainton Family Brewery's Cherrywood Smoked Rye Baltic Porter.
A creation of master brewer Dan Dainton, the tasty drop took out top honours when it was named 2017 Champion Australian Craft Beer at the Craft Beer Awards.
Mr Dainton, who runs his Carrum Downs-based brewery with father Kevin, said he was rapt with the win.
"We have come out on top. It's great to know the long hours of toil have paid off."
Mr Dainton likened the taste of his award-winning beer to a chocolate cigar.
"I came up with the recipe off the top of my head. I had never heard of anything like it," he said.
"The Baltic Porter is a style of beer. I like using rye in beer.
"I like smoky, dark beers. I thought I would give this a try."
The Cherrywood Smoked Rye Baltic Porter also won a gold award in the porter and stout category.
