"And now I'm going to a ball."
But the evening of the University of Sydney's St John's College formal ended very differently.

Mr Perrottet, the younger brother of NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet​, is charged with three counts of sexual intercourse with a 19-year-old woman without her consent near the college car park the early hours of October 18, 2015.
The 20-year-old has pleaded not guilty.

The jury began to hear Mr Perrottet's version of events for the first time as he sat in the witness box in the NSW District Court on Wednesday afternoon.
