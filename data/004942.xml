  <title>Anti-corruption advocates call for incoming PNG gov't to set up ICAC</title>
  <content>
As the political manoeuvring continues ahead of tomorrow's first sitting of PNG's new parliament, an advocacy group has called on all MPs to show a real commitment to tackling the issue of corruption.
ACT NOW! has launched a petition calling on the freshly-elected politicians to support the establishment of an Independent Commission Against Corruption within 100 days.
Prime Minister Peter O'Neill promised to create an ICAC during the last term but it never eventuated.
ACT NOW! campaign coordinator Eddie Tanago says that during the campaigning period many MPS promised to tackle corruption, and it's now time to back up their words with action.
