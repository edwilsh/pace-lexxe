  <title>Off-leash park unveiled</title>
  <content>
Grover the airedale retriever had to wait four years but he's finally got an off-leash park where he can play.
Grover's owner Frances Cottom has campaigned for years and is thrilled Greater Dandenong Council has created one at the eastern end of Springvale Reserve. She first took a petition to council in 2013 but as the years rolled by, she began to doubt if it would ever come true.
Councillor Sean O'Reilly regularly raised the matter until finally the area was enclosed in June.
"Grover loves the park - we go there almost every day," Ms Cottom said.
Cr O'Reilly said the area showed that residents should speak up if they want change.
"It might not happen overnight but it does happen," Cr O'Reilly said.
