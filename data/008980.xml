NEWCASTLE representative coach Stu Pinkerton plans to get more high-profile mentors to the Hunter to share their knowledge after a successful session with Wallabies boss Michael Cheika.

Newcastle senior and junior rep coaches and representatives from premier rugby clubs spent an hour with Chieka on Friday, the final day of the Wallabies' training camp in the city.

"Cheik gave the coaches a fantastic insight on how the Wallabies train, how he plans to move forward with this squad and get better results," said Pinkerton, who played alongside Cheika at Randwick.

Pinkerton involved a number of specialist coaches, including Alan Gaffney, Tim Rapp, Steve Merrick and Jeremy Paul, in the senior rep program this season.
Next year junior and senior teams will train on Sundays at Southern Beaches' complex and Pinkerton will make the elite coaches available to all teams.

* Coaches weren't the only ones to benefit from the Wallabies visit. Breakaway Ned Hanigan did a session with Wanderers. The 22-year-old went to St Josephs College with Two Blues winger Pat Vaughan and was happy to assist.

* Referee Des Gilbert will officiate his 100th first grade game when he controls the clash between Southern Beaches and Wanderers at Alan Davis Field.

* Lake Macquarie prop Willie Fraser will miss the next two games after taking an early guilty plea on a striking charge. 

* Maitland young gun Luke Rees achieved a rare feat against Singleton, playing a part in colts, second grade and first grade.
