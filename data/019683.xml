  <title>Crane collapses on Sydney building</title>
  <content>
Two people have been taken to hospital after a crane collapsed onto an apartment block in Sydney's south.
Police were called to Brodie Spark Drive at Wolli Creek after 9.30am on Sunday, following reports a crane had fallen off one building and crashed into another.
A resident, Felicia Nguyen, told Fairfax Media the crane fell onto a penthouse apartment, crushing a balcony.
Police say no one was inside the crane at the time.
An ambulance spokesman told AAP two people had been taken to St George Hospital, with one of them suffering a leg injury.
Fire and Rescue NSW superintendent Josh Turner told reporters four buildings had been evacuated while they figure out how to remove the crane.
Emergency services have created an exclusion zone in the area with the airport line partially closed between Central and Turrella on Sunday afternoon.
Police have advised people to check www.livetraffic.com.au for updates on road closures.
