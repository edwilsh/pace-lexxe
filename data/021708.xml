  <title>Sister grieves US Marine killed in Osprey crash off Queensland</title>
  <content>
The family of one of three Marines killed in an aircraft accident off the coast of Queensland has asked for prayers for their lost loved one.
Corporal Nathan Ordway from Wichita, Kansas, was onboard the MV-22 Osprey that crashed as it attempted to land on the USS Green Bay about 4pm Saturday, about 30km from Shoalwater Bay military training area.
It's believe the controversial tilt rotor aircraft slammed into the flight deck and slid into the Coral Sea.
Twenty-three of the 26 Marines onboard were rescued, but three could not be saved.
Cpl Ordway's family have confirmed he is among the missing Marines.
His sister took to the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit's Facebook page to ask people to "please pray for my brother".
Family friend Heidi Peltzer also asked for people to "please pray for his life, his safety and comfort for the family", in a social media post.
