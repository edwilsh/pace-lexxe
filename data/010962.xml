Join us for our 2017 Makeathon, where talented Makers will collaborate to create innovative, technological solutions to some of the problems faced by people with disability.

This December, we invite you to join us to Make A Difference and collaborate in one of the most exciting, creative and innovative experiences of a lifetime.
TOM: Melbourne is proudly brought to you by Debbie Dadon AM and Israel Trade Commission in partnership with Swinburne University of Technology and Flying Fox. 
TOM:Tikkun Olam Makers is a global movement bringing together people with disabilities and Makers to develop open source assistive technology to address everyday challenges.
We are proud to host TOM:Melbourne 2017. During the 72 hour makeathon we will develop hardware and software product prototypes designed to meet needs that people with disabilities identify are important to them. By bringing together people who understand the needs ('need-knowers') alongside engineers, designers, developers and makers, and providing a space for innovation and prototyping, we will create solutions, make new connections and share unique experiences.
Join a group of talented individuals for three amazing days to experience how tinkering and technology can impact lives.
