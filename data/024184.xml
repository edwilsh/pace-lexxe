  <title>Garma: What young people think about constitutional recognition and a treaty</title>
  <content>
Indigenous leaders have been tirelessly working at the  to create change for the next generation, but what do young people think about the moves that are afoot?
Siena Stubbs, 15, from the East Arnhem Land community of Yirrkala, said she wanted her people to have a voice in Federal Parliament.
"That would be amazing," she said.

"Sharing a different view from our perspective we aren't all one but just that little insight on this type of life would help.
"We have a lot of intellectual people that have the chance to do that," Ms Stubbs said.
The landmark discussions that have taken place at Garma this year have focused on how to finish the fight for constitutional change so the next generation can focus on other issues.
The calls are for a constitutionally enshrined body in Parliament for Indigenous Australians and a treaty.
"I think that it's important to recognise the past owners and really understand and give recognition because they built the foundation and they've kept culture strong," Siena said.
"Up until now we haven't let anyone knock us down.
"It will be a change that's big but it's just a little tweak and if we can do that a lot of people will be happy," she said.
Garma has been a life-changing experience for many high school students who have travelled to the remote community of Gulkula for the biggest Indigenous forum in the country.
"We learnt to move out of our comfort zone, we made new friends, did various activities," 16-year-old Saraiyah Pilot, from Brisbane, said.

"There's still heaps to understand and learn."
The final forum at Garma focused on the next steps towards constitutional change and many leaders said a campaign needed to be established to encourage the wider Australian population to vote 'yes' in a referendum.
Non-Indigenous students like Brisbane student Sarah Rooshan said they supported those calls.
"It's definitely a good and powerful message that we're all equal," she said.
"Come here, this is one of the best places to learn about Aboriginal people and learn about culture."
