  <title>German unemployment falls</title>
  <content>
The number of unemployed persons in Germany ticked down by 9000 in July, helping the jobless rate hold steady at an historic low of 5.7 per cent.
Monthly jobless queues in Europe's biggest economy contracted for the ninth consecutive month to 2.537 million people in seasonally adjusted terms, the Federal Labour Agency said on Tuesday.
Analysts had expected the data to show unemployment falling by 5000.
At 5.7 per cent, the July jobless rate remains at its lowest level since German unification in 1990.
"The news from the labour market is positive," said Labour Agency chief Detlef Scheele.
"Employment has risen strongly again and business demand for new employees is continuing to rise at a high level."
In seasonally unadjusted terms, unemployment in July rose by 45,000 to 2.518 million as result of the traditional summer slowdown in the labour market.
The unadjusted jobless rate edged up to 5.6 per cent this month from 5.5 per cent in June, the labour agency reported.
Seasonally unadjusted unemployment was 143,000 lower than in the same month year.
