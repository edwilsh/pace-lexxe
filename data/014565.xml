  <title>Avo on toast, but not as you know it</title>
  <content>
SMASHED avo on toast for dessert? Innovative chef Jason Wright will flip breakfast at his new Manly restaurant, Arthur's Oysters & Seafood.
The wacky dish is one of the desserts the former Scottish Rising Star Chef of the Year has created.
"Smashed avo on toast is so popular in Manly, I wanted to have some fun with food and do something that hasn't been done before," he said.
"It is essentially breakfast as a dessert. Everyone who has tasted it is loving it."
Mr Wright's take on the hipster favourite is made by mixing pureed avocado with Glace vanilla bean ice cream.
Wright, who started as a pastry chef, makes 'toast' from toasted dessicated coconut, white chocolate and panko breadcrumbs. This dish is plated up with dollops of mango puree and his piece de resistance, corn flake sauce.
Customers won't need to dip into their savings, smashed avo on toast is $14. Arthur's Oysters & Seafood is located at 46 Pittwater Rd. It opens on August 8.
