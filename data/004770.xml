  <title>Queensland has hottest July on record</title>
  <content>
Queensland has recorded its hottest July on record and above-average temperatures are set to continue for the rest of winter.
The mean temperature across the state was 2.65C above the long-term average of 15.94 per cent, with Mackay and St George measuring their highest maximum July temperatures on record.
The weather bureau's David Crock says the three-month outlook predicts continued high temperatures for the Sunshine State but it's too early to tell if Queensland is in for a scorching summer.
