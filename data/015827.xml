  <title>ANZ CEO says CBA woes will besmirch other big banks </title>
  <content>
ANZ chief executive Shayne Elliott says the other big three banks will allegations of money laundering and suspect transactions at the CBA's ATMs.
Mr Elliott said he was surprised to see the issue emerge at CBA but all the other big banks would be lumped in to the reputational damage because the public tended not to differentiate between the big four.
"We're an industry, and I don't take any pleasure in seeing one of our peers you know, have incidents like that," Mr Elliott told reporters in Adelaide after an ANZ customer lunch.
"I don't know the details, I've only seen what I've read in the newspapers, so you know it was a surprise to see that," he said.

He stridently defended ANZ's own record, saying that ANZ had a maximum customer limit of $5,000 for those types of deposits and had received the all-clear from AUSTRAC in a review of its network.

"ATMs at ANZ, we don't take those kind of deposits so it's a much lower threshold, so it's not an issue for us," he said after the function at Adelaide Oval.
But all of the big four would be caught up in the fall-out. "Anything that happens to one of the large, major banks impacts us all because people see us as an industry".
Earlier at the lunch, Mr Elliott fielded a question from a customer about the CBA money laundering allegations."We don't have that particular issue," Mr Elliott said.
But he said the CBA's reputational battering would spread to the rest of the big four.

"They kind of infect the whole industry," Mr Elliott said.
As the eye-popping  CBA's other rivals were also on the front foot stating their machines were fully compliant, accepted less than $5,000 or removed non-compliant machines years ago.
The staggering 53,700 breaches allegedly made by the bank were detailed in a . The document alleges that Commonwealth Bank had a policy of not reporting some transactions in excess of $10,000 which is a breach of the Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing Act.
Westpac, which is Australia's second largest bank, is believed to have removed any non-compliant machines some time ago. A spokesman for the bank declined to provide specific details around the types of machines that were removed but said the bank was working closely with Austrac.

"Westpac constructively engages with Austrac and takes its obligations around these issues very seriously. While we don't comment on reviews that regulators conduct across the industry, we will continue to work closely with Austrac to ensure that Westpac meets its regulatory obligations," the spokesman said.
A spokeswoman at NAB said automatic teller machines at the bank accept less than $5000 in a single deposit. The intelligent deposit machines at the heart of the Austrac allegations accepted up to 200 notes or $20,000 at a time which Commonwealth Bank processed and automatically credited to the accounts of its customers, some of which were registered under fake names.
"NAB takes its AML/CTF obligations, and its role in protecting our customers from money laundering and terrorist financing, extremely seriously. The development of sound systems and controls are our priority, and we work closely with the regulator on intelligence and regulatory development" the NAB spokeswoman said.
