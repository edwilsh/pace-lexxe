  <title>Victorian murder accused seen with knife</title>
  <content>
An accused killer pulled a long knife partly wrapped in tape from under his mattress before the body of Melbourne man James Russouw was found, a court has been told.
Christopher Lavery, 31, is on trial for the 2008 murder of the 24-year old whose body was found inside his torched Jeep with a taped knife sticking out of his neck beside a Burwood East sports oval.
On Monday in the Supreme Court of Victoria, witness Nicholas McCarey said he once saw Lavery with a knife about 20cm long, with the end wrapped in duct or electrical tape.
