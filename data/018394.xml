  <title>Chris Cornell's daughter sings 'Hallelujah' in his memory</title>
  <content>
The daughter of late musician Chris Cornell has delivered a brave tribute to her father and his close friend, late Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington, on live television in the United States.
Twelve-year-old Toni Cornell took the stage in New York City for a Good Morning America broadcast to honour her father, who took his own life on May 18 this year, and Bennington, who also took his life on July 20.
Bennington's band, Linkin Park, were meant to perform at the event, but pulled out after his death, leaving OneRepublic to step into the breach.
Along with OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder, Toni performed Leonard Cohen's iconic song Hallelujah - the same song Benningfield performed at Cornell's funeral.
"It's an honour to perform this for my dad and for Chester," Toni told Good Morning America.

Toni's confidence in front of a crowd can perhaps be attributed to the handful of times she performed alongside her father at his gigs.
After his death, Toni shared a written tribute to her father on his official Facebook page.
"Our special connection was always the arts. Poems, books, music, writing. We both have a unconditional love for it," she wrote in an open letter to Cornell.
"Who's going to introduce me to movies like 'Purple Rain' and songs like 'The Beautiful Ones' now? I'm hoping I will find some because you trained me so well."
Cornell was found dead in his hotel room after a sold-out concert in Detroit.
Benningfield, who became close with Cornell in 2007 after they toured together, was found dead in his Los Angeles home two months later.
Cornell is survived by Toni, his wife Vicky Karayiannis, his daughter Lillian, 18, and his son Christopher, 11.
Benningfield is survived by his wife Talinda and his six children.
