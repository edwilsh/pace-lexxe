  <title>Vic abortion protester to fight charge</title>
  <content>
A Melbourne woman charged with harassing people outside an abortion clinic is expected to face court.
Kathleen Clubb was charged with prohibited behaviour within a safe access zone in 2016 and is due to in court on Thursday.
When she faced the Melbourne Magistrates Court in December, Ms Clubb's defence lawyer said they planned to fight the charge on the basis it went against the Australian constitution and impinged on "an implied right".
Safe access zones near Victorian abortion clinics came into effect last year, after the state parliament passed legislation banning protesters from harassing people within 150 metres of such premises.
Under the Act, it is an offence to communicate with people entering or leaving such services in a way that is "reasonably likely to cause distress or anxiety".
Clubb was the first person to be charged under the new law, after she allegedly approached people walking near an East Melbourne clinic last August.
