  <title>Angelic Spirit promises better things</title>
  <content>
ALTHOUGH Angelic Spirit scraped in at her debut it was impressive enough for her managing owner, Terry Henderson from OTI Racing, to stamp her as a spring filly.
Henderson said he was expecting an easier win but pointed out she wasn't suited by the slow speed.
RACEDAY FOCUS:
TURF WARS:
"The best part of the win was her last 200m where she ran home in 11 seconds. She needed the tempo a little stronger but they crawled in the early stages," Henderson said.
He said Angelic Spirit had the makings of a VRC Oaks filly.
Angelic Spirit was spotted by OTI's New Zealand agent Phillip Caltado when she won a trial earlier in the year. Angelic Spirit is the first horse OTI has had trained by Trent Busuttin and Natalie Young. She opened at $9 with TAB fixed odds and was backed into $2.80 favourite.Orange pipped
BIG Orange's bid to make it three consecutive Goodwood Cups just failed when he finished second to three-year-old Stradivarius on Wednesday morning.
Big Orange has run in the last two Melbourne Cups, finishing fifth in 2015 and 10th last year but is not expected to come back this year.
Wicklow Brave, who ran 22nd in last year's Melbourne Cup, finished fourth, while Qewy, who finished fourth in last year's Melbourne Cup and also won the Geelong and Sandown Cups, was second last.Paris recalled
TOUGH stayer Trip To Paris, winner of the 2015 Gold Cup at Royal Ascot and runner-up in the Caulfield Cup, has been retired.
His trainer Ed Dunlop said Trip To Paris would be retired to live at the National Stud at Newmarket. "He will be retrained for showing and parading with the Retraining of Racehorses. It's a fantastic place for him to go," Dunlop said.
Trip To Paris finished second to Mongolian Khan in the 2015 Caulfield Cup and fourth behind Prince Of Penzance in the 2015 Melbourne Cup.Talent on trial
AN extraordinary amount of talent will be in action at the Flemington jump-outs on Friday morning. The opening jump out contains Redkirk Warrior, Hartnell and Heatherly,
Lindsay Park has many of its spring aspirants in addition to Redkirk Warrior in action with Vega Magic, Tulip, Formality, Sheidel, He Or She and Harlow Gold all trialling.
