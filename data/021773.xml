  <title>Melbourne weather makes life hard for PNG in AFL International Cup</title>
  <content>
The defending champions Papua New Guinea have lost their opening match in the 2017 AFL International Cup, going down to arch-rivals Ireland 41-30.
Fiji have started the tournament off in fine style with a thumping win over France by 80 points to 14.
AFL South Pacific Development Manager Ben Drew says the tournament is off to a great start, despite the Melbourne weather, and the men's match between PNG and Ireland has set the standard.
