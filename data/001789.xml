  <title>Ram 1500 Rebel Headed Down Under In 2018</title>
  <content>
The  range, available through importer and RHD conversion specialist American Special vehicles, is set to expand Down Under in 2018 with the introduction of the performance oriented Ram 1500 Rebel.
ASV already offers the larger Ram 2500 and  pickup trucks in Australia, and will have its first 1500 Rebel on show at the 2017 National 4x4 Outdoor Show in Melbourne this August.

The Rebel is based on the smaller 1500 model and is powered by a 291kW 5.7-litre petrol V8 engine in place of the bigger 6.7-litre turbodiesel V8 in the 2500 and 3500 trucks.
Other Rebel touches include a unique Ram-branded matte black grille in place of the regular chrome-trimmed crosshair grille that front the bigger pickups, 17-inch alloy wheels with 33-inch tyres, and Rebel-embroidered seats with red accents.
"With the Ram 2500 and 3500 now established in Australia and becoming a regular sight across the country towing the biggest loads, we are now looking at how we are going to expand the Ram range in Australia," says Alex Stewart, General Manager of Ram in Australia.

"The Ram 1500 Rebel takes the legendary Ram Truck in a totally different direction from the 2500/3500, something that is self-evident from the totally different grille and distinctive rumble from its massive V8 engine."
Ram Australia has revealed it is considering launching the model in 2018 priced below the 2500 Laramie which starts at $139,500.
