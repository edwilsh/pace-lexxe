He has pleaded not guilty to one count of manslaughter and an alternative charge of unlawful striking causing death.
On the third day of  on Wednesday, the jury watched a video of Mr Heke's interview with police in the hours following the fatal incident.Photo: Nine News
Mr Heke told officers Mr Merrigan had started "tailgating" him in the fast lane, before he proceeded to swear and make hand gestures.
The jury heard Mr Heke allegedly tried to get away from him, but when he followed the accused also "gave him the finger".

The video showed Mr Heke telling police that after about five minutes, Mr Merrigan wound down his window and motioned for him to pull into a side lane.

Mr Heke was recorded as saying he decided to follow so he could "see what his problem was".
The court heard Mr Heke describe how the pair were swearing at one another when they got out of their cars.
"He's pushed me twice," he told police in the recorded interview.
"He took a swing.
"He hit me on my face."
Mr Heke could be seen holding back tears as he said he then hit Mr Merrigan back.
"He fell on the road," he said.
"I tried to catch him."
The trial continues.
