  <title>Crossfit win '100 times better' than Olympics</title>
  <content>
SHE represented Australia in weightlifting at the Rio Olympics, but Tia-Clair Toomey says winning this year's CrossFit Games is "100 times better".
Toomey finally became the fittest woman on the planet after finishing as bridesmaid in 2015 and 2016.
After her victory, Toomey said the Olympics paled in comparison.
"Ten times better. Like 100 times better," she said.
It was a Down Under one-two at the games, in Wisconsin, USA, with Toomey, on 994 points, just pipping fellow Aussie Kara Webb.
And the pair had plenty of love for each other.
"When I first started CrossFit, I looked up to Kara Webb," Toomey said.
"When you put two Aussie chicks together like that, we don't know how to hold back," Webb said.
"We love our sport. We love our country. I feel so incredibly proud of Tia."
Only the fittest athletes on the planet can make it at the CrossFit Games, widely known as one of the toughest sporting events on the planet.
The games involve events including running, swimming, weightlifting and other tests of strength, fitness and skill.
American Matt Fraser stamped his mark on the sport, dominating the men's event to record back to back titles.
