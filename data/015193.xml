  <title>Ex-union boss charged with destroying docs</title>
  <content>
The lawyer for a former CFMEU boss accused of destroying documents has slammed trade union investigators for charging his client with an offence that did not exist.
David Hanna briefly appeared in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday after reportedly being charged in June with destroying documents in April 2014.
The 52-year-old was originally charged with a section of the Royal Commissions Act that did not exist and had to have the offence amended at his first mention.
Outside court, solicitor Terry Fisher said Hanna was looking at all his options.
"It may well be they've simply charged the wrong person," Mr Fisher said.
"They've had a long time to work on this and they couldn't even get the charge right to start with.
"It just shows the sloppy nature of the investigation."
Hanna's case will return to court on October 6.
