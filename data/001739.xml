  <title>Patrick Dangerfield's Brownlow Medal hopes dashed by MRP's offer of one-game suspension</title>

Patrick Dangerfield's hopes for a second consecutive Brownlow Medal have been dashed by the news the match review panel (MRP) has offered him a one-game ban for a dangerous tackle.
Dangerfield tackled Carlton's Matthew Kreuzer to the ground without the ball, at which point the Carlton ruckman hit his head on the ground. He left the field concussed and did not return to the game.
Debate had raged as to whether Dangerfield would be suspended for the tackle, as the on-field umpire did not deem it a reportable offence at the time.
Geelong and Dangerfield have until tomorrow afternoon to decide whether or not to challenge the ban and keep the Brownlow favourite's hopes of a rare back-to-back alive.
More to come.
