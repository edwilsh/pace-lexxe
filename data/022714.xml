  <title>RSPCA looking for dog allegedly bashed with hammer</title>
  <content>
RSPCA Queensland is appealing for information about a dog which was allegedly bashed with a hammer and has not been seen since.
RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty said the incident occurred about 6.30pm on Wednesday, July 17, at Mott St, Gaythorne.
Mr Beatty said it was alleged that Cheeky, a four-year-old Staffordshire bull terrier, and a blue Australian cattle dog escaped from their yard and attacked a small dog at that time.
"Cheeky was restrained by the owner of the small dog who then allegedly hit her with a hammer," he said.
Cheeky has not been seen since and the RSPCA is urging anyone who may have witnessed the incident or saw someone disposing of a body to come forward.
Cheeky is white with black patches and was wearing a studded black leather collar at the time of her disappearance.
Phone the RSPCA on 1300 264 625.
