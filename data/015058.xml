Victoria has recorded its coldest day in 19 years and there is more wild weather on the way.
Thursday was the coldest day for almost two decades, and most chilly August day since 1970, reaching a maximum of just 9C, the Bureau of Meteorology reported.
Extreme weather has been forecast for the weekend, with strong wind warnings issued for some coastal areas and blizzard-like conditions in alpine regions.
