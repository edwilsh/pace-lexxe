  <title>Sink teeth into Dental Health Week</title>
  <content>
DENTAL Health Week, August 7 to 13, is the Australian Dental Association's major annual oral health promotion event.
The association says the aim of Dental Health Week is to educate Australians about the importance of maintaining good oral health in every aspect of their lives.
This year the theme is Oral Health For Busy Lives, with the aim of helping us all appreciate that, no matter how busy we are or where we are in life, we can find the time to care for our teeth and gums.
Throughout the course of Dental Health Week, dentist everywhere are reminding us to take the time to brush and floss properly, and to make booking time with your dentist as much a priority as booking your car in for a service or seeing your hairdresser.
