  <title>CBA chief Ian Narev says tough regulator obviates need for Royal Commission</title>

Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief executive Ian Narev says the action brought by AUSTRAC, which alleges breaches of the bank's anti money laundering obligations, reflects the work of a tough regulator, which obviates against the need for a Royal Commission into the sector. 
In an interview on Sunday, Mr Narev said the action filed by AUSTRAC in the Federal Court "shows we've got an extremely active, diligent regulator".
Asked whether the latest revelations against Commonwealth Bank - which involve allegations about  - justify renewed calls for a Royal Commission into the banking sector, Mr Narev said: "If you combine APRA and ASIC and AUSTRAC and others, our argument all along has been we've got very strong regulators, appropriately demanding very high standards of us, and they're doing their jobs.
"I think this is an example of a strong regulator being seen to be very forceful." 

"I do not believe what we are seeing here is the result of any cultural aspects in the organisation."

While CBA is preparing to file a defence against AUSTRAC's allegations, Mr Narev said the bank had "made mistakes".
He said it has "a very high degree of respect" for AUSTRAC and that CBA will continue to cooperate with the regulator, a relationship that is crucial to ensure the security of the financial system. 
"The criminal element are becoming much more sophisticated and regulators are doing what they ought to do and becoming much more vigilant. And we need to move in response to those times," he said.
