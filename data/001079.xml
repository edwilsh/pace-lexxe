AUGUST - Haider conducts internet searches on the movements of then prime minister Tony Abbott, an AFL game, and a military base.
SEPTEMBER 18 - Haider confronts police at the Dandenong Plaza with the black and white Shahada flag, often used by IS militants.
The teens posts a photo of himself on Facebook wearing camouflage gear and a balaclava while holding the Shahada flag. Below the photo are derogatory comments about AFP and ASIO.
The photo was posted on the same day NSW Police conducted Australia's largest counter-terrorism operation, with more than 800 officers involved in pre-dawn raids in Sydney.
SEPTEMBER 20 - Islamic State calls on its supporters to kill soldiers and civilians in Australia, the US, and Europe.
SEPTEMBER 23 - Haider, 18, tells a public servant he thinks his application for a passport had been rejected for "bullshit" reasons.
The teen is shot dead outside Endeavours Hills police station after stabbing two counter-terrorism officers who had arranged to meet him at 7.30pm.
OCTOBER 3 - A coronial investigation into Haider's death begins.

2016
MARCH 7 - The inquest into Haider's death begins before Coroner John Olle.
2017
JULY 31 - Coroner Olle finds police had no choice but to shoot Haider as there was no opportunity "for the officers to use a lower force to prevent further injuries".
