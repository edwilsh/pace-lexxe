"It's all over between Amber and Elon and she's devastated. It was his decision," the insider told The Mail on Sunday in the UK.
"He ended it a week ago. He'd heard certain things about her behaviour that didn't sit well with him."
Numerous publications in the US have also confirmed the report with sources telling Us Weekly that their busy schedules had also played a role in their breakup.

The news came after the couple attended Splendour in the Grass music festival in Byron Bay two weeks ago.
The pair have been spotted around the Gold Coast and northern NSW during their time in Australia for filming.
Yesterday, there was radio silence from both camps.

The actor was first linked to the boss of US electric car giant Tesla last summer when they were spotted together in London. Musk made his first millions as co-founder of online payment service PayPal and currently plans to build the world's largest lithium ion battery in Adelaide.
Last month Heard's father David spoke openly about their relationship which he called serious.
"Amber and Elon are both very serious about each other. She would love to get married," he told Grazia magazine.
"One of the things they want to do is settle down and have a family. They are making plans for that."

The breakup follows Heard's dramatic divorce from Johnny Depp.
Their relationship broke-down when the couple were living in Australia while Depp filmed Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.
