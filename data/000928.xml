  <title>Pin-up look a winner</title>
  <content>
AFTER a vintage styling course, Ruby Corvette could not bring herself to go back to "basic hair and beige lipstick".
The 31-year-old won a course with Bettie Butcher at the Bombshell Burlesque Academy last year and went on to compete in her first pin-up competition in November.
"I entered my first pageant, the Christmas-themed Miss Show n Shine, because I just love Christmas and wanted a legitimate excuse to wear a light-up Frozen snowflake dress that I had made," the South Brisbane woman said.
"Taking the time to sew beautiful garments, set my hair and look after my appearance makes me feel amazing, inside and out."
A finalist in the GreazeFest Pin-ups on Parade at Cleveland Showgrounds next month, Ms Corvette said she initially had some reservations about competitions where women were judged on their appearance.
But she found the pin-up scene was a "beautiful, inclusive space".
"Women of all ages, backgrounds and physiques are celebrated for their fashion sense, vintage styling skills, charm and confidence," she said. "Winners are selected based on their style and choices rather than what they've won in the genetic lottery."
