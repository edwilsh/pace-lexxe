  <title>Man dies during penis enlargement surgery</title>
  <content>
A HEALTHY young man in Sweden has died during penis enlargement surgery which involved injecting fat from his stomach into his penis.
Fears are growing for the safety of the procedure after the fluid injected into the perfectly healthy 30-year-old's manhood to boost girth began leaking.
The fat then travelled all the way to his lungs, resulting in an embolism that in turn ruptured blood vessels, according to a study published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences.
Within minutes the patient, who had no previous heart conditions, had a cardiac arrest.
Despite CPR he died two hours later.
The study said: "This is the first described case where a seemingly simple and safe procedure of penis enlargement by autologous fat transfer caused sudden death in a healthy young man".
Urologist Tobias Kohler, of the Mayo Clinic, who was not involved in this study, told BuzzFeed that one reason many advise against the "completely useless" surgery, is because it "never works" and because of "other horrible consequences, from disfigurement to permanent erectile dysfunction to even worse".
In April last year, a fake doctor in New Jersey was jailed for five years after performing the botched penis enlargement surgery that killed 22-year-old Justin Street.
Authorities said the lethal injection shot directly into Street's bloodstream, shutting down his vital organs and leading to his death the following day.
A medical examiner found the young man died from a silicone embolism - a rare complication of cosmetic surgery - and has ruled his 2011 death was homicide.
As reported by Norman Rowe, a board-certified surgeon, a 10-minute Botox-style procedure can add 1.5 inches to the circumference of a man's member.
