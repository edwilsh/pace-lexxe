  <content>
A man and a woman have suffered facial injuries after a violent confrontation in a car park on the Gold Coast.
A group of people were talking in the car park in Main Beach at around 11.10pm on Thursday night when ten cars arrived with a man from one of the cars approaching a 20-year-old man and assaulting him, police say.
A woman, also 20, went to the man's aid but was also assaulted by the man with a group of women who had arrived in the contingent of cars also assaulting the woman.
The attackers left the car park taking the woman's car keys and mobile phone. Both the man and the woman were taken to Gold Coast University Hospital with facial injuries and police are investigating.
