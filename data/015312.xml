  <title>WA surf event stays on championship tour</title>
  <content>
The Margaret River Pro will remain part of the championship tour following a campaign by Surfing WA, professional surfers and the state government.
There was speculation the event would be dropped from the tour after its five-year contract ended this year, but the World Surf League has agreed to at least a two-year extension.
The competition attracts the world's best surfers including Kelly Slater, Mick Fanning and Stephanie Gilmore, and injects $5.4 million to the South West region every year.
