  <title>Crash, bang: Lucky no one was in the lounge room</title>
  <content>
WAS this lucky or unlucky for the occupants of a northeastern suburbs home? Depends on your perspective.
A runaway car smashed through their lounge room wall today, causing a lot of damage - but the home's two occupants were in a different part of the house and escaped injury.
At 11am, a white Ford Ranger ute came off McLaughlan Rd, Windsor Garden, and crashed through a fence and into the home's lounge room.
The driver, a 22-year-old Parafield Gardens man, was taken to the Modbury Hospital for observation.
Two people were home at the time of the incident but were at the rear of the house and escaped without injury.
