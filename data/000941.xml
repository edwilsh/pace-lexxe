  <title>Turbulence factor in fatal Vic plane crash</title>
  <content>
An elderly trainee pilot was likely troubled by turbulence at a rural Victorian airport where he crashed and died, with safety investigators noting a lack of information about the potentially hazardous conditions.
The 72-year-old was killed near Yarram airport in September 2016 while trying to perform a touch-and-go manoeuvre, but fell into a steep descent and hit the ground, the Australian Transport and Safety Bureau said on Monday.
A combination of the pilot's age and medical history, coupled with mechanical turbulence - experienced often near the airfield, but not officially reported - likely exacerbated the mishandling of the light aircraft, ATSB said.
