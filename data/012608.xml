  <title>Former NSW Labor leader to quit parliament</title>
  <content>
Former NSW opposition leader John Robertson has announced his retirement from politics.
He took over the party leadership following its crushing defeat by Barry O'Farrell's Liberal-Nationals coalition in 2011 and stepped down in December 2014.
"The Labor party owes John a huge debt of gratitude for assuming the leadership at perhaps the lowest point in our history, immediately after the 2011 election," current leader Luke Foley said in a statement on Thursday.
"John's courage, tenacity and hard work rebuilt NSW Labor from the ashes of our 2011 electoral defeat."
Mr Foley credited Mr Robertson with Labor's improved result in 2015 when it clawed back 14 seats while running against Mike Baird's coalition.
"John Robertson worked as an electrician at Parliament House and rose to lead Australia's oldest political party, NSW Labor, on the floor of Australia's oldest parliament," Mr Foley added.
"He should be proud. The Labor Party is proud of John."
