  <title>Vic priest charged over child pornography</title>
  <content>
An Anglican priest has been charged with child pornography offences following police searches at a Melbourne church and home.
The 52-year-old was arrested on Thursday when officers visited a church at suburban Sunshine and a nearby residence, following a 12-month police investigation.
A spokesman for the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne confirmed the man was a priest and said he has been "stood down by the archbishop with immediate effect."
The church will cooperate fully with the investigation, the spokesman added.
The priest was bailed to appear in Melbourne Magistrates Courts on Friday, charged with transmitting child pornography and related offences.
