  <title>McDonald's is killing Orange Hi-C  --  and people are furious</title>
  <content>
People are trying to come to terms with the tragic loss of Hi-C Orange Lavaburst at .

McDonald's  that it would replace the iconic Orange Hi-C with a new soda, called Sprite TropicBerry.

While the replacement roll out started in May, it wasn't an immediate switch, as locations continued to serve up Hi-C until their stock was depleted. 

So, some people are still showing up to their local fast-food joint, eager for Hi-C, only to realise that it is no longer being served. 

And, they aren't happy. 

Even McDonald's workers are mourning the loss of the beverage. The cover photo of the Facebook page  currently reads "In Memory of HI-C ORANGE LAVABURST." 

"We had a customer do the voice survey and tell us that we are stupid for getting rid of it," one apparent McDonald's employee commented on the photo. "He told us he was never come back to McDonald's ... He was cussing and then we seen him the next day." 

Business Insider has reached out to McDonald's to see if the chain would ever consider adding the beverage back to its menu, and will update the article if we receive more information.  

Good afternoon to everyone except the  employee who thought of getting rid of the Orange Hi C.
