As you move through the stages of your life, your needs can change. But that doesn't mean your address needs to change too.

More seniors are staying in their home longer, with a recent report by the government Productivity Commission showing over 60 per cent of older Australians would strongly prefer to 'age in place' by staying in their own homes.

4. Kitchen

Slide out shelves and drawers can enhance the usability of your kitchen
Consider installing pull-out or pull-down shelves that move to meet you to reduce the risk of falling objects in your kitchen pantry. Drawers that close automatically can also enhance your time in the kitchen by reducing your exertion when cooking. 
You could also look at having your dishwasher elevated slightly, to reduce the amount of bending you need to do to stack or unstack it. 

Consider sitting rather than standing when working at your kitchen countertop by ensuring your countertops are a range of heights, or alternatively, prepare your food while seated and relaxed at the dining table. 

Easy modifications such as these can enhance your experience in your home and ensure you feel safe and happy as you enjoy your twilight years.
