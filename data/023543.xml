  <title>Justin's sweet anniversary tribute to Jennifer Aniston</title>
  <content>
IT'S been two years since Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux married in a top secret wedding ceremony at their Los Angeles mansion.
Since then, they've continually proven they're #ultimatecouplegoals. And on their second wedding anniversary, Theroux took the opportunity to celebrate the milestone with a super sweet photo - making us just a little bit jealous in the process.
Over the weekend, the 45-year-old actor posted a sweet snap of himself relaxing with his famous wife. In the pic - backlit with a rather angelic glow of sunlight - Aniston, 48, plants a kiss on her man's cheek.
Theroux captioned the moment with three simple emojis: A cupid's arrow, a love heart and the peace sign.
Theroux frequently gushes about his relationship with the Friends star, telling Rhapsody magazine in April: "Marriage makes the small things much smaller and the big things small."
He added: "You have an ally. It's good to have someone have your back."
The two stars first started dating in 2011 before tying the knot in a top secret ceremony at their Bel Air pad in August 2015. Only a handful of their famous pals attended the intimate backyard affair, with Howard Stern, Chelsea Handler, Sia, Ellen DeGeneres and Lisa Kudrow on the guest list. Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel officiated, while Courteney Cox served as Jennifer's maid of honour.
