  <title>Bucky the police dog nabs alleged burglar</title>
  <content>
A FOUR-legged crime fighter managed to sniff out an alleged burglar in East Perth last night.
WA Police's canine operations were called to a burglary at a liquor store on Hay Street about 10.25pm when police dog Bucky was ordered to spring into action.
It is alleged a woman climbed on to the store's roof and entered the building.
"Police attended and when the shop owner arrived, entered the building," Sgt Andrew Maher said.
"Bucky was deployed and located the female hiding behind the shop counter.
"It is further alleged the female removed alcohol from the store and placed it in the roof space."
A 22-year-old Newman woman has been charged with offences including burglary and stealing.
She is due to appear in Perth Magistrate's Court today.
Bucky and his handler spent more than two years based in Geraldton, where the pooch was considered a favourite crime fighter. He recently moved back to Perth.
