  <title>Bail bid by man charged over 1997 murder</title>
  <content>
A man recently charged with the 1997 murder of his Gold Coast business partner is making a bid to be released from custody.
Neil Pentland, 68, was arrested in June following a reignited investigation into the execution-style killing of Philip Carlyle, who was shot four times in the head.
Pentland is expected to face a bail hearing in the Brisbane Supreme Court on Friday.
