  <content>
Rio Tinto has delivered shareholders a record interim dividend, with surging earnings from its iron ore division helping boost underlying earnings for the six months to June 30 by 152 per cent to $US3.9 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of $US4.15 billion; in the previous corresponding period the company's posted underlying earning of $US1.56 billion.
Rio will pay an interim dividend of $US1.10, up from US45¢ for the first half of the 2016 year. It's previous highest interim dividend was US96¢, at the height of the mining boom.
The company has also launched a $US1 billion share buyback of its British shares.

Australia's biggest iron ore miner saw earnings from its key division climb 87 per cent to $US3.3 billion.
Rio shares have surged 37 per cent in the last 12 months thanks to stronger commodity prices.
There were also good results from Rio's coal division, where underlying earnings rose 170 per cent to $US1.4 million, and its aluminium division also posted strong gains, with earnings rising 55 per cent to $1.7 billion.
The Anglo Australian miner has also made its target to cut $US2 billion worth of costs over the 2016 and 2017 years six months earlier than expected.

Rio's net debt was just $US7.6 billion, down from $US9.6 billion at the same time last year.
