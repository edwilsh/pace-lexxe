Swift says David Mueller grabbed her in June 2013 during a visit backstage at the Pepsi Center in Denver.
Swift says she and her support team didn't call police immediately. Instead they called his boss.

The radio station interviewed Mueller and fired him two days later.
Mueller denies inappropriately touching Swift on her buttocks and is suing the singer-songwriter for $US3 million ($A3.8 million) in damages for losing his job at country radio station KYGO.
, seeking $US1 and a ruling that holds him responsible.
