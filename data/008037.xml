  <title>Qld barrister fined $4000 for contempt</title>
  <content>
A Brisbane barrister, who claimed the $50,000 in cash that former Ipswich mayor Paul Pisasale was found with at Melbourne airport belonged to his client, has been fined for contemptuous comments made to a magistrate.
Sam Di Carlo appeared in the Brisbane Supreme Court on Wednesday over contempt proceedings brought by the attorney-general in relation to comments he made to Magistrate John Costello in January last year.
While noting all lawyers experience frustration at times, Chief Justice Catherine Holmes agreed Mr Di Carlo's remarks amounted to contempt and fined him $4000, to be paid within three months.
It came after barrister Shane Doyle QC, for Mr Di Carlo, told the court his client had reflected on his conduct and acknowledged the need to temper his emotions.
But Mr Doyle said it was noteworthy that the 60-year-old had been acting in the interests of his client at the time.
References from former clients also painted him as a "compassionate" legal professional with "an established willingness" to act for those in need including on a pro bono basis, he said.
Earlier this year, Mr Di Carlo came forward a day after Mr Pisasale announced his shock resignation, citing complications linked to multiple sclerosis, to say he'd asked Mr Pisasale to collect the money for him on behalf of a client.
