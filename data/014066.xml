  <title>Commonwealth Bank in damage control over anti-money laundering allegations</title>
  <content>
The Commonwealth Bank is locked in the early stages of damage control as it confronts , exposing itself to potential fines of almost a trillion dollars.

Key points:

Alleged 53,700 breaches involving use of Intelligent Deposit Machines between 2012 and 2015
CBA board predicted to ask why bank's compliance systems failed to detect alleged breaches
Mr Durbin says AUSTRAC has taken view 'that this is systemic'

Gavin Durbin, former senior executive at the financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC, predicted the CBA board would demand answers on how the bank's extensive compliance systems failed to detect or report the alleged breaches.
Mr Durbin, who worked closely on enforcing anti-money laundering regulations at AUSTRAC, told AM that with the allegations going to the top of Australia's biggest bank, a blame game would almost certainly be underway.
"I would imagine that someone's head is going to have to roll," Mr Durbin said.
"It's too serious a breach given the crime syndicates [allegedly] involved and the money involved.
"The reputational damage is what this is all about.
"I think AUSTRAC has taken the view that this is systemic, it's ongoing and a disregard for the law. We can't have that."
The alleged 53,700 breaches involving the use of Intelligent Deposit Machines between 2012 and 2015 attract fines of up to $18 million each - meaning potential fines of around $960 billion.
The Commonwealth Bank said it was cooperating with AUSTRAC and it was committed to adhering to anti-money laundering rules.
However, Mr Durbin said he could not understand how the alleged breaches were not picked up and allowed to continue.
"Frankly I was very surprised. The obligations of the Act are very clear," Mr Durbin said.
"How this fell through I don't understand. I truly don't.
"Not looking at accounts, not reporting suspicious matters - it's the bread and butter of the reporting regime."

The allegations have already overshadowed the CBA's full year profit result, which is set to be released next week.
CBA chief executive Ian Narev will be under pressure to answer questions about the new allegations, as Labor continues to push for a royal commission into unethical and unlawful banking behaviour.
