  <title>Men armed with speargun rob Mackay couple</title>
  <content>
Three men armed with a speargun have robbed a middle-aged couple during a Mackay home invasion.
The trio stole a number of items from the home, including a car.
A 51-year old man tried to stop the thieves by throwing himself on the bonnet of the vehicle.
He fell from the moving car and was taken to Mackay Base Hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
Two of the thieves fled in the vehicle, while the third left on foot.
