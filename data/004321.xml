  <title>Greens to move on charter of rights</title>
  <content>
The Greens are promising to put forward legislation for an Australian charter of rights during this term of parliament.
Australia was the only Western democracy that did not protect the basic rights and freedoms of its people in law or the constitution, party leader Richard Di Natale said in a statement on Tuesday.
The proposal will be referred to an inquiry before the Greens table draft laws.
