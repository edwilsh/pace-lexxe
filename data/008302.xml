  <title>Newborn calf has KISS calling</title>
  <content>
KISS frontman Gene Simmons is udderly thrilled by a newborn calf born with strikingly similar black-and-white markings to the face paint he wears on stage.
Simmons tweeted his admiration for the calf on saying, "This is real, folks!!!"
The calf was born on Friday at a ranch near Kerrville in Texas, which is about 96km northwest of San Antonio.
Heather Taccetta, who lives at the ranch with her family, said the calf belongs to her grandmother.
It's named Genie, in honour of Simmons.
Taccetta says the calf and its mother are doing fine and that Genie is a family favourite and won't be sold for slaughter.
Formed in New York City in 1973 by Simmons, Paul Stanley, Peter Criss and Ace Frenley KISS became known for their face paint and stage outfits as they rose to fame on the back of their sensational live performances.
With their makeup and costumes they took on the alter egos of comic-book type characters.
They began performing without the makeup in 1983, but later returned to the stage with it intact.
KISS have sold more than 100 million records worldwide with hits such as I Was Made for Lovin' You, Rock and Roll All Nite and Shout it Out Loud.
