At least 10,000 Queenslanders have already been struck down by the flu and more are expected to fall ill in the coming weeks, the state's heath department has warned.
Most of the 10,831 cases recorded this year, about 78 per cent, were for influenza A while 22 per cent have contracted influenza B, according to Queensland Health.
Communicable disease director Dr Sonya Bennett has urged people to be vaccinated, saying 1,324 Queenslanders had so far been hospitalised with 126 needing intensive care.
