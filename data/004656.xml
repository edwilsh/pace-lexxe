  <title>SA's Dignity Party announces nominations</title>
  <content>
Dignity Party MP Kelly Vincent will be supported by a speech pathologist and a former South Sudanese refugee in her bid to retain the party's sole upper house seat at next year's South Australian election.
In second spot on the ticket will be Diana Bleby, a speech pathologist, while Esther Simbi, a social worker and former refugee from South Sudan, will run in fourth spot.
Ms Vincent, who has cerebral palsy, was one of youngest woman elected to an Australian parliament in 2010 under tragic circumstances.
She was the party's second nomination, with their first candidate dying days before the election.
The party faces a tough fight to win seats with a push by Senator Nick Xenophon to establish a new state-based political party - SA Best - which aims to attract disgruntled voters.
