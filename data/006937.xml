  <title>Police confirm identity of body found</title>
  <content>
POLICE have confirmed a body found in a vehicle pulled from the water near Gladstone last week is 69-year-old missing man Leslie Shulze.
The body was found in a car at Tooloola last week but police could not confirm the identity until after a forensic examination.
Police said preliminary results indicate the death was non-suspicious.
A report will be prepared for the coroner.
Mr Shulze vanished in June, prompting an extensive search by police.
Police said last week that they believed the vehicle may have gone into the waterway the same day Mr Shulze was last seen, on June 19.
Weeks of trawling through CCTV led police to the discovery of the car.
