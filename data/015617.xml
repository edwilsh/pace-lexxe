  <content>

FootyFix: Can the Cats win without Danger?

Sam McClure previews all the footy action ahead of round 20 in the AFL.

Dangerfield had been a strong chance to become the first player since St Kilda champion Robert Harvey to win back-to-back Brownlows.

"All I can do is sit there and say 'is the rule correct?'
"I think the rule is right.
"In this case, was the application of it right?
"We've been through it and I think it is, and if it wasn't, I think it would have been challenged at the tribunal."
McLachlan noted that former AFL football boss Mark Evans had introduced new guidelines to allow more players to accept fines, rather than suspensions, for low-level offences.
He said he was satisfied with the outcome of those changes and did not believe further changes to the Brownlow eligibility were needed.
McLachlan said it would be up to Dangerfield to decide whether he wanted to present this year's medal given the possibility he might poll the most votes but be ineligible to win.
