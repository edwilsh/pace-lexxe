  <title>Corruption findings against Joe Tripodi, Eddie Obeid, Tony Kelly: ICAC</title>
  <content>
Three former NSW Labor ministers engaged in serious corrupt conduct, the Independent Commission Against Corruption has found and may face criminal charges.
The long-awaited report from ICAC's investigation into the controversial water infrastructure company Australian Water Holdings, released on Thursday, made no corrupt findings against federal senator Arthur Sinodinos.
Former NSW MPs Tony Kelly, Eddie Obeid and Joe Tripodi, however, did engage in serious corrupt conduct in relation to their actions concerning a public-private partnership proposal for the supply of water infrastructure, the ICAC says.
The , found the trio misused their position as members of parliament to back a plan by AWH that would benefit Mr Obeid and his family.

The report found Mr Kelly and Mr Tripodi misused their political influence by arranging and preparing a Cabinet minute that would improperly favour the AWH proposal and Mr Obeid.

"In doing Edward Obeid Sr's bidding, Mr Tripodi understood that he was conferring some benefit on Edward Obeid Sr or the Obeid family," the report says.
"Given the closeness of their relationship, it is likely that Mr Tripodi knew that the Obeid family was interested in investing in AWH.
"He knew that approval of the AWH PPP proposal would increase the value of that company and therefore knew that anyone investing in the company stood to benefit financially in the event the PPP proposal was approved."
The report found Mr Obeid misused his political influence to promote AWH's interests to the NSW government "when he knew that the advancement of those interests would financially benefit the Obeid family".
