  <title>Roughy 'learning on the fly' as Hawks skipper</title>
  <content>
Hawthorn has recovered from an 0-4 start under Jarryd Roughead

AS JARRYD Roughead prepares for his 250th game, the Hawthorn skipper says he has had to "learn on the fly" in his first season as leader.

Roughead missed all of 2016 after dealing with a PCL reconstruction in a knee and then a return of melanoma.

Having dealt with the cancer, the forward returned this season to lead a side that was bundled out at the semi-finals stage last year by the Western Bulldogs, and without traded champions Sam Mitchell (West Coast) and Jordan Lewis (Melbourne).

The Hawks added a couple of boom recruits in Tom Mitchell (Sydney) and Jaeger O'Meara (Gold Coast) but struggled early in the season, copping successive 86-point beltings at the hands of the Suns and Geelong in the first month of the season to begin 0-4.

Since then, they have performed a remarkable recovery to sit 12th and within reach of an eighth-straight finals berth, but Roughead acknowledged he had doubts after taking over the captaincy from Luke Hodge.

"I heard (Swans skipper) Josh Kennedy say last week that you kind of look at yourself and ask the question if it's your fault," Roughead said at Waverley on Tuesday morning.

"You do go through those moments but at the end of the day, you understand it's a totally different side to what I've known in the past and what everyone else has.

"So when you get to these situations, you've just got to try and get through as best as you can because you learn on the fly, as it's my first year as captain."
