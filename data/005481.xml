  <title>Mahmoud Hrouk's mother tells court of the last time she saw her son alive</title>
  <content>
Mahmoud Hrouk​ worked as a labourer six days a week, and always got up at dawn.

"I said 'No, God bless you,'," Maha Dunia​ told the NSW Supreme Court on Tuesday, holding back tears.
That was the last time Ms Dunia saw her son alive.

Mahmoud was found dead in a vacant house in Fairfield East the next day, after leaving his family home in the evening to go to McDonald's in Villawood.
The teenager's parents called him throughout the evening to ask where he was, and at one point he told them he was at "Aymen's house", the court has heard.

Aymen Terkmani​, 24, is on trial, accused of murdering Mahmoud and sexually assaulting him. He has pleaded not guilty.

Ms Dunia described coming home from her mother's house to find Mahmoud had not returned from his bike ride to get fast food.
"I was doing vine leaves to cook for Sunday for our family dinner and later on [my husband] asked me to call him," Ms Dunia said.
"I told [Mahmoud] to come home and he said 'Mum, it's alright I'm with my friend. I will come home on my push bike'. I said 'You better come home now'."

"I said 'Mahmoud, don't worry about the bike, I will come to pick you up' and ... he was whispering and he said 'Mum, I'm with my friend Aymen and come and pick me up'."  
Her son whispered a street name to her, before the line cut out, she said.
Ms Dunia said she and another relative later went around to Mr Terkmani's house, saw her son's bicycle near the verandah and called out his name, to no avail.
The family spent the night searching through neighbouring suburbs, looking for Mahmoud at friends' houses, and even asking the manager at McDonald's if they could see CCTV vision.
Mahmoud's father Azzam Hrouk​ said he spoke to Mr Terkmani outside his house about 4am, asking him where the teenager was.
The court heard that at one point Mr Terkmani said: "Are you interrogating me?"
Early on the morning of May 17, the family went to the vacant house on Belmore Street, where Mahmoud's body was found, after a friend pointed them there.
"Did you knock on the door and shout 'Mahmoud, Mahmoud, anybody there?'" Crown prosecutor Adrian Robertson said.
"I knocked on the door, yes, I had no idea if Mahmoud was there or not," Mr Hrouk said.
The trial continues before Justice Lucy McCallum.
