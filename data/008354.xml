  <content>
The 40-metre pedestrian bridge at Picton is the longest in the Wollondilly shire.
The longest pedestrian bridge in the Wollondilly shire has been opened at Picton.
The 40-metre bridge llinks the existing walkway in the botanical garden with Picton sportsground.
A suspension-style bridge, it uses the same engineering principles as Sydney's ANZAC Bridge.
"This bridge has been something that the Picton community have asked for through the years," said Wollondilly Mayor Judith Hannan.
