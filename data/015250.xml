Australia's emissions have risen one per cent over the year to March, mainly due to an increase in LNG exports.
The latest update of the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory also showed emission levels, excluding the land use and forestry sector, rose by 1.6 per cent during the March 2017 quarter.
Climate Council chief Amanda McKenzie said the federal government was failing the one test of a climate policy, to cut pollution levels, and if it wasn't for action by state governments the figures would be worse.
