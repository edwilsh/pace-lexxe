  <title>Verstappen rejects Ricciardo's rant</title>
  <content>
IF YOU ever want to make an enemy, just find yourself an F1 teammate.
So often in the racing world those who share the same garage develop the frostiest relations. Up until this point Red Bull pairing Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen have - save for a few hiccups along the way - appeared to get on pretty well together.
That changed on the weekend when , which the Aussie said was down to emotion rather than any attempt to improve his position on the track.
"That was amateur to say the least. It's not like he was trying to pass. He doesn't like people passing him," Ricciardo said immediately after.
"I didn't really know what happened. It's just frustrating, it was not even an overtaking move. It was an emotional response.
"I don't think there is an excuse for it."
Verstappen was apologetic in the aftermath but has rejected that assertion, saying he was jostling to put himself as close to the front as possible in the early stages of the race because of how difficult it is to overtake at the Hungaroring.
"You know, the first lap needs to happen, and you need to try and get in the best possible position," Verstappen said, per . "That's when you go for it, because that will be your position. You do everything you can, of course, to move forward.
"I locked up and from then onwards you are just a passenger in your own car. Look, we were both looking to move towards the front. I locked up because I had another car in front of me and then I hit Daniel. That is of course not want you want, but you don't do it on purpose."
In a video uploaded to Red Bull Racing's Twitter account, Ricciardo said: "It's all good, things are done, we've moved on so I'm not going to hold onto it. It's all good."
Verstappen echoed that sentiment, saying he would talk to Ricciardo again to smooth things over.
"I've talked to him, but we will probably talk again before the next race at some point," said Verstappen. "We have always had a very good relationship."
VETTEL'S CONFIDENT FERRARI BOAST
Championship leader Sebastian Vettel is confident Ferrari will stay the course in its tight title fight with Mercedes and says its knows what it needs to focus its car development on.
With a return to winning ways in Hungary last weekend, Vettel has headed into F1's summer break with a 14-point lead over Lewis Hamilton, while Ferrari's second one-two of the season has reduced its deficit to Mercedes in the constructors' championship.
Ferrari has won only won one race after July, Singapore 2015, in the last six seasons but Vettel is confident the 2017-spec Maranello team is a more formidable proposition.
"The team is in a much better shape this year," he told Sky F1 after a brief two-hour run in the SF70-H on the final day of the Budapest test, when he set the fastest time.
"If you have the right results coming your way you start to pick up a bit of momentum and so it's up to us to keep it going. But I'm quite confident we have the right people, we know how to build a strong car, and we have improved the engine this year massively, so everything is going in the right direction.
"We will see in terms of time whether we will be ahead or behind but I'm confident we will be there and hopefully fight for a lot of big points."
Accepting there are "some weaknesses here and there on the car", Vettel nonetheless says Ferrari is aiming to develop the SF70-H to the point where it is ahead of Mercedes at all tracks.
"We have been competitive everywhere we went," he said of the season's first 11 races, of which Ferrari has won four.
"Now, it's true to also say Mercedes here and there have been more competitive and we have been a little bit behind. We know what the car needs. It's normal that from track to track there's a little bit of a difference but that's not our target.
"We want to be the best on every track we go to and we're working on it. We have quite a good understanding of what the car needs and now we have a bit of time to look into a couple of things in a bit more peace and calm. But the most important thing is we know what we need."
For the first time since 2013, his last title-winning year, Vettel leads the standings at the August break with the German never previously having been beaten to the drivers' crown in a season in which he has led the championship.
"It's more important to lead the championship after the last race but, if you could choose, that's the position you want to be in (now too)," he added. "You don't want to be on the back foot. A long way to go but we have all the ingredients that we need to stay there."
