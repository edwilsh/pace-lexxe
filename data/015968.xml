A MAN, 19, accused of leading police on pursuits at Medowie and Mayfield, hitting a police officer with his car and assaulting a truck driver has been refused bail in Newcastle Local Court.
Police say Tyson James Booby had eight warrants out for his arrest when he was allegedly spotted driving a Holden sedan in Medowie about 9.15am on Thursday. 
As police got out of their car, the Holden allegedly reversed into an officer, causing minor injuries, before accelerating away. 
The pursuit was terminated at Williamtown, but re-engaged for a short time at Mayfield before the Holden stopped due to "mechanical issues", police said. 

The driver allegedly ran from the scene, entered the cab of a truck and assaulted the driver before police arrested him. Mr Booby has been charged with 18 offences and did not apply for bail on Friday.
