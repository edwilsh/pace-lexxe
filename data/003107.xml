  <title>Ken hits sweet notes</title>
  <content>
KEN Chadwick has had more than a passing interest in the evolution of musical entertainment over the years.
The director of the Sunshine Coast Concert Band has devoted more than 20 years to directing musical groups while raising thousands of dollars for charity.
When he first joined the organisation, it was known as Caloundra City Concert Band but the name was changed to reflect the diversity of the 40 volunteer musicians and the different charities they supported.
"We changed the name because I got people from as far up as Pomona coming, right down to Maleny and Mooloolah," Ken said.
Over the past two decades, he has watched music on the Coast evolve "very dramatically" and the band has had to adjust accordingly.
He remembers when modern-day instruments were introduced to provide a more electric sound to the concert band.
"I started to play guitar, then I went to bass guitar, then I we went to keyboard," he said.
"I brought in a young guitar player who was a good soloist so we could play Glenn Miller music and pick up and become electric again."
But he said instrumental music had survived and there was increased interest from musicians wanting to learn.
Music has been a huge part of Ken's life as he taught high school students how to play instrumental music before his retirement in 1986.
He said the quality of high school bands on the Sunshine Coast was very high, particularly the concert band at Matthew Flinders Anglican College.
Even at 89 years of age, his passion for classical music is still strong and he said he was fortunate to work for a charitable cause in retirement.
"A lot of people when they retire, they sit around waiting for the grass to grow so they can mow it," Ken said.
"But I have got passion still - very much so.
"It's a reason for living for me because I try to entertain my musicians, we try to entertain the audience and all the money goes to a charity."
