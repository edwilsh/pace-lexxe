  <title>Shane Mumford faces nervous wait as Giants trounce Demons</title>
  <content>
Brett Deledio finally reached the light at the end of the tunnel, but Shane Mumford could spend some time in the dark as Greater Western Sydney sent a giant message to their rivals.
Deledio brought an end to a 385-day wait when he ran out for the Giants against Melbourne, and the veteran's club debut coincided with an "Orange Tsunami" washing over Manuka Oval.
Deledio was a part of a crippling injury crisis that had plenty writing the Giants off but they sent an ominous message to their premiership rivals with a 14.13 (97) to 10.2 (62) win over the Demons.
The Giants erupted when Deledio kicked his maiden goal in orange during the fourth term, punting with it the calf issues that have plagued him in recent years.

But Giants ruckman Mumford could come under scrutiny from the match review panel after slinging Melbourne's Corey Maynard into the turf and collecting his opposite man Max Gawn in the head with a shoulder.
The match featured two September hopefuls but the Demons crumbled under the pressure, as the Giants overturned an early three goal deficit to amass the club's largest first quarter score in history.

Success in Canberra is vital to the Giants and the AFL took another step towards establishing itself as the No. 2 code in Canberra after another sell-out crowd of 14,274 packed out Manuka Oval.
It wasn't all smooth sailing in the coaches box with word Giants mentor Leon Cameron needed medical attention after punching a door frame following a below-par effort from Lachie Whitfield.
A second straight Canberra clean sweep pushes the Giants into second on the premiership table - a status usually not fit for a side enduring such a horror injury battle.
The Demons are now locked in a mad scramble with four other clubs to keep in touch with the top eight as the clock ticks down in the race to the finals.
The hosts had the inspiration in Deledio but it was Josh Kelly leading the way on the paddock, bagging three goals that may soften talks he wants out of the club.
The Demons started the week as rank outsiders in the betting markets but certainly didn't start like it as they booted the opening three goals.
The Giants were skinny in the forwards without key big men Jeremy Cameron, Jon Patton and Toby Greene, leaving Rory Lobb, Steve Johnson and late inclusion Harry Himmelberg to shoulder much of the load.
But it was Stephen Coniglio that got things started with a freakish goal, sparking an onslaught nobody saw coming in the opening stages.
Spark something it did as a freakish bounce gifted Tom Scully a goal before hometown hero Himmelberg nailed the third major of his 11-game career to steal back the advantage.
It was an advantage they wouldn't let go, breaking the shackles and looking a shadow of the side that had won just two of its past seven games.
A Kelly-inspired Giants tightened the screws in the second term and put the result beyond doubt despite the best efforts of Gawn, who was one constant in the Demons' disappearing act.
