  <title>Hawkins, Grundy offered two-match bans</title>
  <content>
Geelong's terrible run of form with the match review panel has extended into a second consecutive week, with key players Tom Hawkins and Mitch Duncan offered suspensions for their punches in Friday night's loss to Sydney.
In an explosive day for the MRP, Collingwood ruckman Brodie Grundy, GWS enforcer Shane Mumford and Essendon Brownlow hopeful Zach Merrett are also facing suspensions.

AFL plays of round 20

It's all about the six pointers; Hannebery through traffic kicks a ripper, Coniglio has a claim to GOTY in Canberra, McDonald-Tipungwuti nutmegs Petrevski-Seton at the G, Billings clutch kick against West Coast and Eddie Betts is back from surgery to work his usual magic from the pocket.

The in-form spearhead Hawkins is set to miss crucial clashes with Richmond and Collingwood after being handed a two-match ban for striking Sydney's Dane Rampe.
Hawkins' ban cannot be reduced due to his poor record. He was handed one-match bans for his jumper punch on Adelaide's Matt Crouch back in round 11 and his punch to the chin of Greater Western Sydney co-captain Phil Davis in 2016.Photo: AAP
Hawkins, who has become the poster boy for jumper punches given his history, made contact to Rampe's head with his left fist while holding him with his right hand, in an incident that saw the MRP comfortable with deeming there was enough contact to constitute low impact.
Once the minimum level of force was established, Hawkins was always going to be in trouble given off-the-ball incidents are almost always categorised as intentional as opposed to careless.

Duncan can accept a one-match suspension for a gut-punch to Tom Papley.

It now means that the Cats will have to face a rampaging Tigers outfit without Hawkins, Duncan and inspirational captain Joel Selwood who was ruled out for the remainder of the home and away season late on Sunday with an ankle injury.Photo: AAP
Patrick Dangerfield's decision not to challenge his ban last week, for his tackle on Matthew Kreuzer, will be looked upon even more glowingly now, given he can return to give the midfield some much needed grunt as they prepare to take on Dustin Martin, Trent Cotchin, Dion Prestia and co.
Grundy has been handed a three-game suspension that can be reduced to two with an early plea, following a dangerous tackle on North Melbourne big man Ben Brown.Photo: AAP
Brown was taken from the ground on a stretcher and transported immediately to hospital, after his head crashed into the ground in the Grundy tackle, which saw both of Brown's arms pinned.
The stretcher and the need for a trip to hospital were strong factors in Grundy's tackle being graded as high impact, as opposed to last week's incident, which saw Dangerfield's tackle on Kreuzer categorised as medium impact.
With the AFL becoming increasingly frustrated at players throwing punches - which resulted in the announcement of a crackdown under then football boss Simon Lethlean, Merrett can also accept a one match ban for his punch to the stomach of Carlton's Lachie Plowman.
Uunless the Bombers make the unlikely decision to challenge at the tribunal, Merrett will now be ineligible for the Brownlow Medal in a season where he is expected to poll strongly.
A frustrated Merrett lashed out at Plowman near the boundary line, punching him in the stomach with his left arm just prior to a ball-up.
The Mumford loss is a significant blow for the Giants, who come up against an in-form Western Bulldogs side on Friday night at Etihad Stadium. Coach Leon Cameron had already stated that Dawson Simpson would once again cover for Mumford should he be suspended for the bump on Max Gawn.
The Giants are almost certain to get back Jonathon Patton who missed the win over Melbourne with hamstring tightness, while fellow forward Toby Greene will return from suspension.
