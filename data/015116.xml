  <title>Novel Perth meth rehab centre in court win</title>
  <content>
An innovative rehabilitation centre for male methamphetamine users in Perth's Swan Valley can stay open for now after a Supreme Court ruling gave it a second to chance to secure local council approval.
Shalom House needed the approval to operate, which the City of Swan refused and also appealed against a State Administrative Tribunal decision to refer the matter back to the council for reconsideration.
The Supreme Court has sent the case back to the SAT for determination, which Shalom House has welcomed as a good result and one step toward an outcome.
