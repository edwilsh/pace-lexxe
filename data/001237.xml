  <title>The Cheesemaking Workshop takes out the cheese</title>
  <content>
CHEESE is not only a favourite for you and I, but the judges too of this year's Sunny's Business Awards.
The Cheesemaking Workshop was awarded four gongs at the celebration of Coffs Coast businesses on Saturday night.
With a deli offering about 160 different cheeses and kitchens to teach people the art of cheese making, The Cheesemaking Worshop proved to be cut above.
"The Cheesemaking guys are just taking it up another level," Sunny's Business Awards coordinator Leonie Kennedy said.
Unable to separate the curd and the whey, The Cheesemaking Workshop was appointed joint Tourism Attractions winner with The Big Banana.
Judges could not split the winners of the Business of the Year award after Moonee Beach Tavern and Total Gardens and Landscape Supplies were awarded the top gong.
"Both companies stood out in their respective categories. The judges had a dilemma, they couldn't split it," Ms Kennedy said.
Diversity was a stand out at this year's awards, with employment agencies, publishing houses, trade services, spa, taverns and garden centres amongst the many businesses sharing the limelight.
"It was really great having that diversity," Ms Kennedy said.
Award winners will now get a chance to vie for the NSW Business Chamber Regional Awards at Port Macquarie next month. Winners then progress through the NSW Business Chamber State Business Awards in Sydney at the end of the year.
