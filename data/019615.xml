The Japan Meteorological Agency on Sunday warned of mudslides, flooding, high waves and swollen rivers on Kyushu and other southern islands.
About 200 flights have been cancelled in the region as the season's fifth typhoon was approaching Kyushu and the southwestern island of Shikoku.
As of 10am on Sunday, the eye of the storm was near Tanegashima island, travelling slowly, with maximum sustained winds of 126 kilometres per hour, the agency said.
Rainfall of up to 600 millimetres was forecast for Kagoshima prefecture, including some southern islands, and up to 400mm for Miyazaki prefecture by Monday morning.
