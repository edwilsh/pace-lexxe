  <title>Lightning hits plane on tarmac, injuring airport worker at Fort Myers, Florida</title>
  <content>
An airport worker is recovering in hospital after the plane he was working under was struck by lightning.
Austin Dunn, 21, had followed the Sun Country plane onto the tarmac at Fort Myers, Florida, as it was being readied for take-off.
As he stood beneath the plane near the wing, lightning struck the tail of the jet, causing a visible flash where Mr Dunn was standing.
The ground worker immediately collapsed as his panicked co-workers called for medical help.

The victim's sister Autumn Dunn said she feared the worst when she heard the news.
"My dad called, and he said your brother was electrocuted, and he's at Lee Memorial, and all I asked was, 'Is he alive?'"
Mr Dunn was rushed to hospital and treated for severe burns.
"Once they knew he was alive, it was a relief. It was definitely a scary thing," Ms Dunn said.
No-one on the plane was injured.
