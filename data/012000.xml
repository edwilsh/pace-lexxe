  <title>Young man may be deported over sex attack</title>
  <content>
A young Melbourne man who sexually assaulted a 13-year-old girl and stole her mobile phone may face deportation to his native Ethiopia after serving a sentence, a court has been told.
Bill Tang has alleged links to the Apex street gang and was found guilty of indecent assault and other offences after a 2015 attack in which he and three other youths surrounded the girl and her friends in Cranbourne. He is yet to be sentenced.
The 20-year-old faced the Victorian County Court on Thursday where defence lawyer Chris Pearson said Tang's permanent residency status had been revoked since the incident.
