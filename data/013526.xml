  <title>New talent on show</title>
  <content>
THE concept behind this growing event is to give up-and-coming bands a platform to perform live so they can take their music to the next level. It's an opportunity The Blockades will grab with both hands.
The trio, comprised of Caleb Freeman and Dylan Thompson, both 14, of Redcliffe State High School, and Jade Roles, 15, of Cashmere, are part of the line-up for this month's show on Saturday.
This will be their first performance at Scarborough Originals and they are pretty excited.
Roles said they played different genres to "keep it interesting" but mostly played alternative rock with punk influences.
All three want to pursue a career in music after they finish school.
Roles said they were all passionate about music and the band.
"It's always been a dream to play in a successful band," Roles said.
"It's always been a thing to play in a band with people who want to be there," Thompson said.
Freeman said they met through Red Music Centre's Jam Club and were known as Fling before becoming The Blockades two months ago. They hope their experience at Scarborough Originals will open doors for them. Search for The Blockades on Facebook.
