The North Korean leader and his wife have held a grand banquet to celebrate the July 28 launch of an intercontinental missile, which was attended by officers responsible for the launch and officials from the ruling Workers' Party of Korea.
Among those attending the banquet held by Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang were Ri Man-gon, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, and Kim Rak-gyom, head of North Korea's Strategic Rocket Forces, the Rodong Sinmun newspaper and state news agency KCNA reports.
The event also featured an orchestra performance and a choir.
"The great success in the second test-fire of Hwasong-14 has established a new world political structure with socialist Korea as its axis," Ri said during his speech, according to KCNA.
He also urged the country "to ceaselessly produce new-type ballistic rockets ... and to make a series of successes in the field of defense scientific research."
North Korea on Friday successfully launched its second intercontinental ballistic missile.
The Hwasong-14 missile flew 998 kilometres for about 47 minutes and reached a maximum altitude of 3,724.9 kilometres before falling into the Sea of Japan, also called the "East Sea" by the two Koreas.
After the test, Pyongyang claimed that the rocket could reach any part of the United States.
