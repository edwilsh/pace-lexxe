A Sydney man arrested over a plot to bomb a plane bound for the Middle East has been charged with a non-terror related offence.

18 MINS AGO  UPDATED 5 MINS AGO

A fourth Sydney man accused of involvement in a plot to bomb a plane destined for the Middle East has been charged with a non-terror related offence.

The 39-year-old was arrested last Saturday alongside three other men, two of whom were later charged with preparing for or planning a terrorist act while the other was released without charge.

The fourth man was on Sunday bailed to appear in Downing Centre Local Court on August 24 charged with possessing a prohibited weapon.

He had been held under specific provisions of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, which according to police "recognises that terrorism investigations are inherently complex and that there can be legitimate reasons for extended periods of detention for suspects in such matters".

One of the other men arrested, 49-year-old Khaled Mahmoud Khayat, was accused of attempting to have his brother take a bomb on an Abu Dhabi-bound flight on July 15.

His unnamed sibling was unaware the military-grade explosive was hidden in a meat grinder and stashed in his luggage but it never made it through security, police said.

They also alleged a second was planned after the first plot failed. It involved an attempt to build an improvised chemical dispersion device to fill a plane with hydrogen sulfide, a colourless toxic gas.

Khayat, of Lakemba, and co-accused 32-year-old Mahmoud Khayat, of Punchbowl, had their matter mentioned in Parramatta Local Court on Friday after being charged on Thursday night.

They were refused bail ahead of another court mention on November 14.
