Reefs of discarded beer bottles on the bed of the River Derwent are believed to have a role in helping to save the critically endangered spotted handfish from extinction.
The fish lives in highly localised habitats in only nine areas of the River Derwent and one site in the D'Entrecasteaux Channel.
The rare fish walks along the Tasmanian seabed on long fins resembling hands and is the first marine species in the world to be classified as critically endangered.
Senior researcher at CSIRO Dr Tim Lynch said handfish liked complex breeding habitats but boat moorings and invasive pest species like the North Pacific seastar were damaging the breeding grounds.
But Dr Lynch said discarded beer bottles had proven to be an ideal breeding location.
"There are a couple of sites, one over near Bellerive and Howrah and another one near Battery Point, where there are bottle reefs ... which provide good habitat," he said.
"The seastars can't eat the bottles at least, and we often find spotted handfish hiding behind discarded bottles.
"There's quite a few bottles out there, I think is some places where people have mooring up their yachts or windjammers since the 1800s and drinking their rum and throwing them overboard."

Artificial habitats essential for survival

Dr Lynch has been part of a program to help create artificial spawning habitats in the river.
Over the past 10 years a range of people, including other scientists and volunteer groups, has placed about 6,000 plastic sticks on the river bed for handfish to lay eggs on.
Dr Lynch said there were various projects to help the handfish's survival and the work over past 20 years had probably kept the species going.
A $40,000 grant from the industry-backed Zoo Aquarium Association and matching funds from the CSIRO's Marine Diversity Hub will fund a new program to start a captive breeding program for the species.
Dr Lynch said it has been found the handfish breed well in captivity.
Each fish lays up to 200 eggs after a courtship dance between the male and the female, and the female then cares for the eggs until they hatch.
The breeding program will begin with the capture of a small breeding population which will then be propagated at the Sea Life Aquarium in Melbourne and at Seahorse World at Beauty Point in Hobart.
"Let's let people have a look at these things - hardly anyone has seen them," Dr Lynch said.
The second step would be an insurance population and the third step would be captive breeding and the release of fish back into the wild.
"They shouldn't be a rare fish, they used to be very common," Dr Lynch said.
"There should be a spotted handfish every five metres of so in good habitat."
