  <title>Venezuela: Chief prosecutor critical of Maduro removed, ordered to stand trial</title>
  <content>
Venezuela's chief prosecutor has been fired and ordered to stand trial, less than 24 hours after a newly elected legislative superbody was installed with sweeping powers to strengthen President Nicolas Maduro's grip on power.

Key points:

Ms Ortega had accused President Nicolas Maduro of human rights abuses
She said the new assembly was fraudulently elected
Venezuela is under growing international pressure over the assembly

Since the opposition started a round of protests in April, Ms Ortega has become President Nicolas Maduro's main challenger from within the ruling socialist movement, accusing him of human rights abuses.
, unanimously decided to remove her in its first session on Saturday.
His loyalist Supreme Court sent a letter to the assembly informing it of an indictment against Ms Ortega, accusing her of "alleged commission of serious misconduct," without further outlining the charge.
Earlier in the day, security forces had taken up position in front of her office, blocking Ms Ortega from entering the building.
She left on a motorbike amid the chaos.
The constituent assembly replaced Ms Ortega with human rights ombudsman Tarek Saab, a government ally whom the opposition says has turned a blind eye to state abuses.
The new legislative body has no checks on its powers, and critics say the decision to remove Ms Ortega is an ominous sign of a swerve by Mr Maduro into full-blown dictatorship.
"The constituent assembly is solving Maduro's political problems, handing out quotas, and lynching institutions," said opposition lawmaker Jose Manuel Olivares after news of Ms Ortega's removal.

The constituent assembly could also re-write the constitution, re-arrange state institutions and allow Mr Maduro to rule by decree.
Assembly members had said they would fire Ms Ortega the first chance they got.
Trade bloc suspension adds to pressure

The South American trade bloc Mercosur suspended Venezuela indefinitely on Saturday, adding to international pressure on Mr Maduro over the assembly.
Foreign ministers of Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil announced the decision in Sao Paulo, urging Mr Maduro to release prisoners and immediately start a political transition.
"We are saying: Stop with this! Enough with the deaths, enough with the repression," Brazilian Foreign Minister Aloysio Nunes said.
"It is not possible to inflict such torture on the people."
Asked to comment on Ms Ortega's dismissal, Mr Nunes replied with a Latin proverb: "Whom the gods would destroy they first drive mad."
Mercosur has no provision for expulsion - it had suspended Venezuela temporarily in December for not complying with the bloc's regulations, and toughened its stance following the weekend's controversial election.
Countries around the world have condemned the vote, calling it a bid to extend Mr Maduro's rule indefinitely.
