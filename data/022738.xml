Police are urgently searching for a missing Victorian woman, after her backpack was found abandoned on a Gold Coast beach on Monday morning.
A member of the public found the backpack at Kurrawa Beach about 6.15am, with the woman's clothes and other belongings inside.
The water and beach were searched but found no trace of 40-year-old Gail Elizabeth Oliver, but members of the public did see a woman matching her description walking from the area overnight.
Police were appealing for Ms Oliver or anyone who may know of her whereabouts, to make contact with police immediately, as concerns were held for her welfare.
