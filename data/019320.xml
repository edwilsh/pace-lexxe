  <title>Super Rugby final: Crusaders beat Lions, create history</title>
  <content>
Crusaders boss Scott Robertson's legion of All Blacks stalwarts can finally say they have added to the history of the Super Rugby franchise after their 25-17 grand final win over the Lions.
Tries to Seta Tamanivalu, Jack Goodhue and Kieran Read got Robertson's troops over the line against their 14-man opponents in Johannesburg this morning (AEST).
Despite their advantage - brought about by Kwagga Smith's 38th-minute dismissal for tackling David Havili in the air - the Crusaders did it the hard way, labouring against a spirited Lions resistance.
Down 25-3 with 20 minutes remaining, the Lions picked up two tries in quick succession and finished the match with more possession, territory and carries.
Yet it was not enough to peg back a clinical Crusaders outfit, for whom victory helps heal the wounds of their 2011 and 2014 grand final defeats.
Barring Read and veteran prop Wyatt Crockett, none of the Crusaders' current crop of All Blacks had previously won a Super Rugby title.
Robertson - who broke out his trademark break-dancing routine on the Ellis Park turf after the match - said that blot on their copybook was now rectified.
"A Sam Whitelock, a Joe Moody, a Matt Todd, a Luke Romano - all of them, those guys, they've created a bit of history for themselves," Robertson said.
"Now, on their CVs, they can say they've won it [and] can say they've added to the esteemed history of the Crusaders jersey.
"Because we had so many All Blacks who hadn't won it, I did play on it a bit."
In what was the Cantabrians' first Super Rugby triumph since 2008 and their eighth overall, Robertson's troops achieved a competition first - they crossed the Indian Ocean for the final and emerged victorious.
Yet they struggled at times on a dry track, with their arduous travel commitments and the 1,750-metre altitude taking a toll.
Tamanivalu went over in the ninth minute, sprinting 80 metres to the tryline after some shoddy Lions breakdown work, before Goodhue crashed over in the left corner two minutes later.
Smith's red card then left the Lions with too much of a second-half mountain to climb, with coach Johan Ackermann off to Gloucester on a sour note.
Robertson, meanwhile, became the first person in history to lift the Super Rugby trophy as both player and coach.
"Even with 14 men, our boys were shattered with 20 to go. It's like we needed 12 on the bench," Robertson said.
"I just kept sending messages, you've got to be strong with your body language, you have to just break it down into two-minute blocks.
"The players' effort was just phenomenal."
