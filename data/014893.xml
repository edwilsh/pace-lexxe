For the first time in 100 years, residents from a remote Indigenous community on the Cape York Peninsula have enlisted in the Australian Army in a bid to disaster-proof their community.
The last time anybody from Wujal Wujal served was during WWI when two men, Norman and Charlie Baird, were deployed to the Western Front.
"They came back alive and went to their homeland," descendant Aunty Marie Shipton said.
The Bairds served during a time in Australia's history where .
Yet, Aunty Shipton said they returned as heroes to their community, five hours north of Cairns.
Wujal Wujal council's chief executive Eileen Deemal-Hall said there were several reasons why nobody from the community had served since WWI.
"A lot of it had to do with government policies of the day and whether they were allowed to serve, and given the opportunities to serve," she said.

Bad weather pushes community to enlist

The tipping point encouraging residents to once again enlist was after flooding cut off Wujal Wujal for eight days earlier this year.
Ms Deemal-Hall said the crisis showed council that they needed to boost young people's confidence and resilience so they could be leaders and take charge in times of crisis.
To encourage recruitment, the council has been working with Major Joshua Mickle, commander of Alpha Company, 51st Battalion of the Far North Queensland Regiment.
The 51st is part of the Army Reserves and is an Indigenous Australian battalion with members from Cardwell all the way to the Torres Strait.

Great-grandson of WWI veteran joins up

Ten Wujal Wujal residents were sworn in to the 51st Battalion in a Cairns ceremony on Thursday, including 24-year-old Clayton Baird, a great-grandson of one of those original WWI soldiers.
"It's been a long journey [and] I'm pretty proud of myself," Mr Baird said.
"I'm looking forward to patrolling and going in a chopper."
Major Mickle said the recruits would now undergo four weeks of "pretty intense training" in far north Queensland.
"It's about building resilience," he said.
"The skills they'll get out of this is teamwork, communication, first aid and navigation [and] all those skills will benefit community in times [of crisis], should they need it."
