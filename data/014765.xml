  <title>UNDP leads drive for change after PNG women's election failure</title>
  <content>
The outcome of the Papua New Guinea election was dismal for the record number of women candidates, with not one securing enough votes to win a seat in parliament, a development which is being viewed widely as a huge backward step for the country.
So now the United Nations Development Programme is joining forces with PNG's Registrar of Political Parties and the Chief Ombudsman to push for real change, and far greater participation by women in the political process.
Rufina Peter stood as an election candidate in the Central Regional seat, and she says women running for office in Papua New Guinea need more help, in a more timely fashion, if they are ever going to end the male dominance of Parliament.
