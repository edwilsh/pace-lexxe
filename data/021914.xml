  <title>You're Not Alone review: repulsive, inappropriate and often brilliant</title>

THEATRE
YOU'RE NOT ALONE ★★★★
Malthouse Theatre, Until August 13
This review will not offer a blow-by-blow description of You're Not Alone. Spoilers might bolster your defences to a piece best seen unguarded, and a sizeable fraction of what you'll witness isn't fit for print.Photo: Geraint Lewis
Comedian, guerrilla filmmaker, and performance artist Kim Noble made this show after a relationship breakdown. Typically, the rest of the paragraph would be filled with eye-roll emojis, but this is not a typical night at the theatre.
No, Noble has created a blend of stand-up comedy, kinky video and live art that rides a wave of depressive illness into one of the most eccentric quests for connection you'll ever see. It's repulsive and hilarious, wildly inappropriate and sometimes obscene, with a piercing, wild-card poignancy that anchors and deepens all the desperate clowning.Photo: Geraint Lewis
He's a bit like a cross between Ricky Gervais and Ursula Martinez - deadpan British miserablism pancaked onto left-field autobiographical burlesque - and his guiding star here is the subversion of human relations devoid of intimacy or fellow-feeling: the kind of loneliness in the crowd that makes you more isolated than solitude can.
In this vein, Noble might stalk a check-out chap at the local supermarket and plaster him with awards, or dress up as an employee at a hardware store chain for a year, startling customers out of their comfort zones.

He's the kind of guy who doesn't baulk at getting up close and personal with a dead pigeon, who can concoct a pornographic response to the loud sex his upstairs neighbours are having, and who fires exploding rockets at Jeremy Clarkson books just for the cathartic thrill of it.

One motif is the contradictory power of the internet to connect and to alienate, explored through a series of encounters where he poses as a woman to catfish horny men online - an act of impersonation he takes way, way too far.
Yet just when you think the show can't get any odder, we are introduced through short video clips to Noble's dying father. It's an affecting reminder that isolation is existential, and perhaps that taste isn't relevant when someone you love is in abject need.
Please, take the trigger warnings on this show seriously. If you're easily shocked, you should avoid it. (I'm not, and my stomach churned at some of the stuff portrayed.) But if you do go, this strange, often brilliant experimental work will more than repay your daring.
