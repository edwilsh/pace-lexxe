  <title>Dad saves son from house blaze</title>
  <content>
A FATHER has saved his son's life after waking him as he returned home to find their house up in flames in Melbourne's north this evening.
MFB spokeswoman Heather Stockton said the 60-year-old father arrived home just after 4.30pm and bravely entered the "well alight" Mill Park house before waking his 35-year-old son and escorting him out, along with the family dog.
Ms Stockton said crews arrived to the Clayton Court home about five minutes later. She said 26 firefighters battled the fire for 40 minutes before bringing it under control.
The brave father suffered smoke inhalation and was taken to hospital, while the 35-year-old son and family dog were treated on the scene for smoke inhalation but did not need further medical attention.
Firefighters will remain at the property overnight.
Ms Stockton said there were concerns for a second pet dog.
She said the front of the house suffered substantial damage, with family members needing alternative accommodation.
MFB investigators will determine the cause of the fire in the morning.
