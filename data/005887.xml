  <title>Asbestos discovered in Sydney Opera House, 25 workers exposed</title>
  <content>
A work ban has been imposed on renovation work at the Sydney Opera House after asbestos was found in the wiring.
The Electrical Trades Union (ETU) said 25 workers involved in the $200 million renovation had been exposed to the fibres while working in a service duct.
The union said it took too long for workers to be told about the discovery.
"Our ETU members have been exposed to deadly asbestos," the ETU's Justin Page said.
"The contractor Downer failed to notify our members for approximately five days that asbestos had been detected and confirmed at that site.
"Our members raised the issue of [the] possible presence of asbestos last Monday."
SafeWork NSW is now investigating the matter and will assess all the circumstances.
