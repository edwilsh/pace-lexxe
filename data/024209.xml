  <title>Decorated new chancellor appointed to university</title>
  <content>
THE University of the Sunshine Coast turned over a new leaf yesterday with the welcoming of a new chancellor.
Air Chief Marshal Sir Angus Houston AK, AFC (Ret'd) was formally appointed by the Governor of Queensland, Paul de Jersey AC and will ensure USC works towards its goals.
He will also lead the USC's governing Council and be responsible for strategic and governance oversight.
Sir Angus, who was chief of the Australian Defence Force from 2005 to 2011, is the university's fourth chancellor and was preceded by John Dobson OAM who served in the position for a decade.
His notable achievements since he began working closely with USC in 2011 include being a driving force behind the establishment of the Sunshine Coast Mind and Neuroscience - Thompson Institute as chair of USC's QMNI Foundation Board.
Sir Angus has also helped the university work towards becoming a leader in community mental health.
Other previous chancellors include Ian Kennedy AO who served from 1998 to 2007 and retired Justice Tony Fitzgerald QC from 1994 to 1998.
