  <title>Beerwah Glasshouse thumps Eagles to break finals drought</title>
  <content>
FOOTBALL: A dominant victory has broken a long finals drought for Beerwah Glasshouse.
The side bumped into the top three on the Sunshine Coast premier men's ladder after defeating Caloundra 3-0 on Saturday night.
It has been a lengthy absence for the Beegees from the finals, and an even longer one in terms of silverware, with the side last tasting success in 1996.
Midfielder Zac Carew said the team was still on a high with the milestone feat in round 25 of 27.
"Beerwah is the most successful club on the Coast and they have the most flags than anyone but they've also had the longest run of just nothing," he said.
"We're all buzzing to know that we cemented our spot in the finals."
He credited coach Daniel Carew for bringing the Beegees back from the brink.
"He's done really well and it's showed - in one year we've just kind of brought Beegees name back on the map," he said.
For too long the Beegees had been a side "no one gives a second thought about", according to Carew.
"Even the first half of the season we were still underestimated by most teams and to get to the point we are at now in the top four and proving to everyone we have what it takes to be in the finals is (great)," he said.
The  result puts Caloundra out of the finals race.
In other games, Noosa defeated Kawana 3-1 in a top-of-the-table clash at Sunshine Beach to regain top spot on the nine-team ladder. Gympie beat Woombye 4-2 and Nambour Yandina beat Buderim 3-0.
