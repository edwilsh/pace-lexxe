  <title>Dannii Minogue makes musical comeback</title>
  <content>
After a Sia song, an arena tour and a global TV show, Dannii Minogue has revealed she is making a musical comeback as the support act on Take That's Australian arena tour.
While Minogue has been a stalwart on reality TV shows such as The X Factor and Let it Shine, both at home and in the UK, her musical output has mainly been as a duet partner to her sister Kylie or as a guest on Tina Arena's recent Greatest Hits record.
But last year, Minogue got the bug for performing again after a support slot for Culture Club on their Aussie tour.
"It gets in your veins and it's like 'OK I want to do a little bit more of this' but this is just the ultimate to be on the road with Take That," Minogue told AAP.
Minogue could come out and just perform her old dance classics including This Is it and All I Wanna Do but the singer is focused on putting out new music with a track set to drop on Friday as she performs at the Central Station Records 40th anniversary party in Sydney.
"It's called Holding On and was done by (DJ) Hook n Sling and he's worked on some fantastic dance stuff, so I'll just try and work with and be inspired by other people," she said.
Minogue has also turned to Adelaide songwriter extraordinaire Sia, who has written her a song she hopes to release in November.
One of Sia's trademarks is the expansive vocal range on her tracks, and Minogue definitely felt challenged by that.
"I just had to go away and kind of say 'well this is her melody clearly, this is a Sia melody but how do I sing it?' I just had to sing it a lot and just get in the groove with it but I feel like I've found a place where it feels comfortably mine."
Minogue is choosing to release her music as an independent artist in order have more time with her seven-year-old son Ethan.
But she's not stepping away from TV just yet, and hints her next project is not an Australian production.
"It's more global than that," she said.
"But I can't really say anything about it. But I'll be getting back on sets quite soon."
Take That with Dannii Minogue tour dates:
* Nov 11 - Perth Arena
* Nov 13 - Adelaide Entertainment Centre
* Nov 15 - Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne
* Nov 17 - Qudos Bank Arena, Sydney
* Nov 18 - Brisbane Entertainment Centre
* Nov 19 - Newcastle Entertainment Centre
