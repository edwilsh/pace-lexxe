  <title>Shark Tank shock: Steve turns tables on contestant</title>
  <content>
TONIGHT'S episode of Shark Tank sees a first for the show, as panellist Steve Baxter turns the tables on one pitcher - only for his stunt to just about blow up in his face.
Young entrepreneur Kjetil Hansen fronts up to the Shark Tank panel to ask for an investment in his company Deliciou, a brand of bacon-flavoured vegetarian flavouring sprinkles.
Once he starts reeling off figures, it's clear Hansen is committing that all-too-common Shark Tank sin: Overestimating the value of his business.
"You said earlier on that you enjoyed watching Shark Tank ... something tells me it didn't comprehend with you. You've actually come with a very impossible ask to fund," says tech start-up pioneer Steve Baxter, who by this point in the season is firmly placed as the show's prickliest panellist.
"You've asked for 25%. It can't be done ... If you sit in my chair here, we can swap and give it a go. Come on. Get down here."
With that, Baxter's up and out of his seat, with a rather confused-looking Hansen taking his place.
Baxter delivers the same pitch he just heard, then asks Hansen what he thinks.
There's a moment's pause.
"Well, that sounds fantastic," he responds, to cheers from the other Sharks: "You called his bluff!"
Laughs aside, it seems the other Sharks are also sceptical about Hansen's pitch. He's chided by Boost juice founder Janine Allis, who's visibly annoyed at his response when she asks him about the projected growth of his company.
"Be careful - don't throw numbers out like that when it's actually just really fanciful. You lose all credibility. Your supplier has you by the balls," she tells him.
So will anyone actually invest in Hansen's bacon-flavoured pitch -  on the Shark Tank scrapheap? The episode airs 9pm tonight on Network Ten.
