  <title>Playwright icon Sam Shepard dies</title>
  <content>
OSCAR-nominated actor, director and playwright Sam Shepard has passed away aged 73.
A spokesman for the Shepard family said the cause was complications of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease.
He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of pilot Chuck Yeager in "The Right Stuff." He was also the author of forty-four plays, as well as several books, including short stories, essays, and memoirs.
He received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1979 for his play "Buried Child."
More to come.
