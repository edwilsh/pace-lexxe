Former Brisbane Lions player Michael Voss is selling more Queensland property assets.

A double block of land owned by former Brisbane Lions triple premiership captain and Brownlow medallist Michael Voss is set for auction this month.
Voss, now a Port Adelaide midfield mentor, has owned the property at 68 Panorama Place, Mount Gravatt East, for the past 10 years.
Ray White - Holland Park selling agent Piers Crawford said the block was already split (450sq m and 688sq m), and had received an offer from a developer to build a massive home on the property.
He said Voss had relocated to Adelaide long term and was keen to sell the land.
"The homes already in that area are massive," Mr Crawford said.

68 Panorama Place, Mount Gravatt East.

"Whoever buys it has the option of building one or two homes on that site."
Mr Crawford said the property, which goes to auction on August 19 at 1pm, had great views and city glimpses.
"It is discreetly positioned in a quiet cul-de-sac. The block flows down the back corner of Mt Thompson," he said.
In May, Voss finalised the sale of his Coorparoo estate at 62 Marriott St, for $2.575 million.
