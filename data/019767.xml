  <title>Bruce Hwy Sunday nightmare: Traffic gridlock after crash</title>
  <content>
THE DEPARTMENT of Transport and Main Roads has advised all northbound lanes of the Bruce Hwy have been affected and motorists can expect delays after a single-vehicle rollover.

The crash was reported shortly after 3.30pm, north of Roys Rd.

There were no reported injuries to the driver, but traffic has ground to a crawl northbound from Roys Rd towards Caloundra.

The Department has advised drivers to proceed with caution, with delays expected as the scene is cleared and traffic congestion slowly eases.

Leads standings going into final day of action.
