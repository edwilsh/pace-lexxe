  <title>Olympic champion Betty Cuthbert dies aged 79</title>
  <content>
Australian Olympic champion Betty Cuthbert has died aged 79, after suffering multiple sclerosis.
Sydney-born Cuthbert was 18 years old when she won three gold medals at the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne.
She took home gold for the 100m sprint, 200m sprint, and the 4x100m relay.
During her career, Cuthbert set new records for the 600m and 200m sprints and the 100-yard, 220-yard and 440-yard dashes.
Cuthbert went on to win gold in the 400m event at the 1954 Tokyo Olympic Games.
She was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1974 and battled the disease for many years after retiring from her sporting career.
