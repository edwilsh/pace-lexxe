  <title>Midges to bite on a full moon</title>
  <content>
BASTARD midge numbers are expected to explode around next week's full moon, prompting health warnings.
Midge numbers are predicted to peak three days before and after each full and new moon until December.
Medical Entomology director Nina Kurucz said Top End residents and visitors should cover up, using insect repellents and avoiding mangrove areas where biting midges breed, especially around sunrise and sunset.
"Cover up with long-sleeved shirts, long trousers, socks and shoes and apply DEET or Picaridin-based repellents," she said.
"Insecticide coils, mosquito lanterns and insecticide barrier applications are also helpful."
She said scratching midge bites could easily break the skin, introducing bacterial infection that can lead to unsightly sores.
