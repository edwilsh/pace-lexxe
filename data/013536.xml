  <title>Remember the cranky Pig? He's back...</title>
  <content>
WE MET Pig earlier this week in his first book, Pig the Pug.

Today, we meet again.

In the second book in this collection, Pig the Fibber, we are thrown into the chaos and mayhem that is Pig's life.

His mate Trevor the dachshund is still getting the blame for all Pig's mishaps and Pig isn't afraid to tell a few white lies to get his way, but this time it's a bowling ball that comes out as the mighty symbol of justice and retribution.

This fun children's book by Aaron Blabey could be yours for just $2.30 with today's paper.

It's one of the 15 classic stories in our Great Australian Storybook Collection and it ends this Sunday.

Coming up with tomorrow's paper is Waltzing Matilda.

Here are the remaining books to collect:

Friday, August 4 - Pig the Fibber (QT)

Saturday, August 5 - Waltzing Matilda (QT)

Sunday, August 6- Wombat Stew (The Sunday Mail)
