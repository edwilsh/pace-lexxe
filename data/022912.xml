  <title>Duo armed with golf clubs threaten nightclub staff</title>
  <content>
STAFF and patrons at a Sunshine Coast pub were forced to take cover as two men armed brandished golf clubs in retribution for being thrown out of the venue.
Sippy Downs man Daniel Edward Lachmund and Brightwater man Rhys Anthony Latham each pleaded guilty today to the charge of going armed to cause fear.
On July 17 just after midnight, Lachmund was removed from O'Malley's Irish Pub at Mooloolaba for being excessively drunk, police prosecutor Stephen Potter told the Maroochydore Magistrates Court.
Both Lachmund and Latham returned to the pub at 12.45am carrying golf clubs.
The court heard the pair waved the golf clubs to intimidate a staff member and made verbal threats.
Staff members and patrons took cover, while security guards forced Lachmund and Latham away from the premises.
Police arriving at the scene identified the pair's car as they fled the area.
Duty lawyer Ben Rynderman said the men were "embarrassed" by the incident.
Magistrate Haydn Stjernqvist noted Lachmund had a dated but serious criminal history.
He fined the men $800 each and did not record convictions.
