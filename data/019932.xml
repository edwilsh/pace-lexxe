  <title>Golf, space and surf lure buyers to Winchelsea estate - realestate.com.au</title>

AS its name suggests, The Green is a golfer's paradise.
The 110-lot community overlooks the Winchelsea Golf Course and even offers a free 12-month family membership for residents.
"Fittingly, The Green was the major sponsor of the recent open golf tournament held at the course, with current and future residents invited to attend an afternoon tea and meet their neighbours," selling agent Josh McDonald of Armstrong Real Estate said.
But you don't need to be a mad golfer to buy into The Green.
Located only a 20-minute drive from Geelong, The Green is pitched at buyers seeking a decent amount of land and some space to breathe.
"All lots are a generous size of at least 1000sq m and for those growing families wanting plenty
of room to move in their own backyard, The Green is the perfect option," Mr McDonald said.
"The community will also offer a small number of much larger 4000sq m lots in later stages, which is an exciting opportunity for those who want even more land."

The community is close to the Surf Coast and the stunning Great Ocean Rd. It is a 41-minute drive from Lorne and a little more than an hour from Melbourne.
Colac is 26 minutes away in the car and Geelong's Waurn Ponds, and the newly updated Waurn Ponds town centre, is a 20-minute drive away.
"Travel times have been made even quicker with the relatively new dual-lane highway from Waurn Ponds, meaning that residents at The Green can enjoy a quiet country lifestyle while remaining easily connected to both Geelong and Melbourne," Mr McDonald said.
Lots begin at $162,000 (the price includes rear fencing for stages one and two). Stage two construction is under way at The Green, with stage three expected to start in the coming months.
There will be eight stages in total, and a number of residents - nearly an entire street - have already moved in.
The Green is also surrounded by reserves and parks and is a short drive from the Winchelsea train station.
Mr McDonald said that once all residents had moved in for stage one, the developers would host a series of "get to know your neighbour" events to encourage a sense of community among the residents.

Another block is snapped up at The Green.
