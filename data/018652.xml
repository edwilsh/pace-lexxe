  <title>Freo flies back into winning form</title>
  <content>
A SERIES of Fremantle's most famous victories and magic moments have come under Subiaco's bright lights.
The 2013 preliminary final win over Sydney, when the frenzied Dockers took pressure to a level matched only by the electric crowd.
The courage and poise of Shaun McManus after being flattened by David Wirrpanda in 2001. Justin Longmuir's goal after the siren against St Kilda in 2005.
The backs-to-the-wall triumph against the Western Bulldogs after a week of upheaval earlier this season.
Fremantle's final night game at ageing Domain Stadium, in front of the club's smallest home crowd this season of 27,050, won't live as long in the memory.
But those that did come left with what they came for. A win.
The Dockers' 12.18 (90) to 10.7 (67) triumph over Gold Coast was their first victory at home since round nine.
McCarthy or Messi?

The fans were treated to the spectacle of Nat Fyfe v Gary Ablett at stages, while Lachie Neale set it up early as he and his captain engage in a battle for the Doig Medal over the remaining weeks of the season.
Neale kicked a goal to go with his 11 clearances and 32 disposals, with Fyfe also superb, while forward Cam McCarthy kicked four goals in his best outing as a Docker.
The purple army haven't seen much of defender Luke Ryan at Subiaco, but they should see him for many years at Perth Stadium.
Ryan, a mature-age selection who was working as a carpenter when the Dockers took him with pick 66 in last year's national draft, looks a steal and is now building a fine foundation to his AFL career.
The 21-year-old came with a reputation as an elite kick. Ryan, who took 16 marks, showed multiple times last night that courage was another of his qualities and together they are a couple of great assets to have.
The Suns, who smashed Fremantle 146-109 in the contested possession count, were willing but sabotaged their efforts with some poor ball use throughout.
Ballantyne breaks through

The visitors kicked four of the game's first six goals as Peter Wright underlined his towering presence with two goals.
The Dockers managed to steady and then made their move in the second term. The home side was far more clinical going forward, booting four goals to one for the quarter despite the Suns dominating at the stoppages.
Neale was able to hold up in close virtually single-handedly, having seven clearances and 19 of his touches in the first half as Fremantle took a 16-point advantage to half-time.
McCarthy had already equalled his biggest haul as a Docker when he kicked his third goal 10 minutes into the second quarter.
Wright's third major narrowed the gap to 11 points early in the third quarter, before Hayden Ballantyne's timely emergence.
The popular veteran had just one touch in the first half, but inspired the loudest roar of the night when he snapped a goal mid-way through the term.
The Dockers had the game all but in their keeping by the final change and they would have been happy with the stalemate as Gold Coast took 15 minutes to get the first goal of the last stanza.
