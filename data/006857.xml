A saltwater crocodile has been caught off one of Australia's most well-known beaches, favoured by US presidents and international celebrities.
Department of Environment and Heritage Protection (DEHP) wildlife officers captured the 2.6-metre crocodile off Four Mile Beach in the far north Queensland tourist hotspot of Port Douglas on Monday.
The long, wide beach is considered the jewel in far north Queensland's crown and has attracted the likes of former US president Bill Clinton as well as a swag of celebrities including Tom Hanks, Mick Jagger and Kylie Minogue.
It is not the first time a crocodile has been spotted off Four Mile - there has been several croc attacks on dogs this year and the beach was closed in April after a 4-metre reptile was spotted swimming offshore.
Queensland Environment Minister Steven Miles said the crocodile that was caught yesterday was not the one they were looking for.
"A member of the public saw a crocodile leaving Dickson Inlet with a turtle in its jaws around 200 metres north of the Four Mile Beach patrolled area and just 20 metres off the headland shore," Mr Miles said.
"Wildlife officers targeted the animal for removal and recent sighting warning signs were deployed, as well as a baited crocodile trap.
"Wildlife officers do not believe this was the target animal and so the trap will remain deployed for the time being."
Douglas Shire Mayor Julia Leu said Four Mile Beach was only recently rezoned under the Queensland Crocodile Management Plan, which means crocodiles seen in the area can now be immediately targeted for removal.
"Certainly if it was posing a threat to beachgoers on Four Mile, it's a good sign that the new measures and the crocodile management plans, as it applies to [Port] Douglas, is working," Councillor Leu said.
She said she hoped authorities would catch the other crocodile soon.
"There is a concern that the particular crocodile is [still] out here, but I certainly commend the department and the officers, because they have had this trap there for some time," she said.
The captured reptile will be relocated to a crocodile farm or zoo.
The beach remains open.
The DEHP issued a statement reminding residents and visitors that "no matter how many crocodiles have been removed, no waterway in crocodile country can ever be considered to be free of crocodiles".
