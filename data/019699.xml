  <title>Helicopter called to mountain rescue underway on Mt Beerwah</title>
  <content>
A RESCUE helicopter is preparing to winch a 32-year-old woman from Mount Beerwah this afternoon.

Firefighters, SES crews and ambulance officers are also on scene, after reports the woman was nauseous and dehydrated and required stretchering off the mountain.

A Queensland Fire and Emergency Service spokeswoman said the helicopter was preparing a winch rescue, but rescuers would scale the mountain in gloomy conditions if the chopper rescue was unable to be carried out.

The woman was not believed to have suffered any other injuries.
