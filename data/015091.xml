  <content>
THE only house on an island off Mackay has gone on sale for the price of a house in Sydney.

Number 1 Victor Island is on the market for $3,500,000. It is a five-bedroom, two-bathroom lowset house on 7.7 acres of bushland, complete with freshwater dam.

The only house on Victor Island, off Mackay, is for sale for $3,500,000.Contributed

Victor Island is located to the south of Mackay, less than two kilometres from the mainland. Access is from several boat ramps including Grasstree Beach, Campwin Beach, and Hay Point.

The property generates its own power using a solar electricity system with a back-up generator. There are ten rainwater tanks and a 100sqm freshwater dam for water storage.

The listing with Savills states: "There are no renovations or repairs to be done. There is no infrastructure to create or equipment and furnishings to buy. All that work has been done and virtually all the equipment on the island is still under warranty. There is also an NBN connection.

"The high-end renovation included a four-bedroom, two-bathroom home with king and queen ensembles, unique retractable blade ceiling fans in the bedrooms and air-conditioning to the master.

"There is a fully renovated self-contained caretaker's cottage, which includes a new kitchen and bathroom

"There are many walking trails that wind their way throughout the island, plus plenty of birdlife to enjoy as well."

Also included is John Deere 4WD tractor with bucket and a zero-turn lawn mower, both less than 12 months old.

The island is also being sold with a new Quintrex 610 hardtop Trident boat with a 150hp Mercury outboard, plus alloy trailer, along with a variety of tools and equipment.
