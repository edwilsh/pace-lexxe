BOOKMARK this - the annual Mayor's Reading Challenge is back.
Mayor Brian Cunial hosted a 'Storytime' event at Frankston Library last week to launch this year's challenge.
"By helping our children develop a hunger for reading we are giving them the best chance to do well at school," he said.
"Last year we had 260 children embark on over 5500 reading activities as part of the challenge.
"This is a fantastic turnout and I hope to see even more people participate this year."
The challenge is for children aged up to five years and encourages parents and carers to share as many reading experiences with their children as possible.
Children and parents collect prizes for every 20 reading experiences and after a month of reading, collect a rewards pack including a certificate signed by the mayor.
"I encourage all families to visit their library to become a member and sign up for this fun challenge with their children, where they can foster a lifelong love of reading," Cr Cunial said.
To register, visit library.frankston.vic.gov.au or call 9784 1020.
