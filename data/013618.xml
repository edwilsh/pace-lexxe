  <title>Luxury gated homes on drawing board</title>
  <content>
A NEW range of luxury townhomes designed by award-winning Queensland architects Hollindale Mainwaring will be launched by Stockland at North Lakes in coming weeks.
It will be the final residential opportunity of its kind in the suburb, developers said.
The collection of 96 architownhouses, named "Vida", will be nestled within a -private gated community adjoining the North Lakes bus station, at the corner of Endeavour Blvd and Lakefield Drive.
"Innovative design will be a hallmark of the townhomes, with cleverly integrated features providing the ultimate in contemporary urban living especially suited to Queensland's subtropical climate," Stockland regional manager David Laner said.
The two, three and four-bedroom townhouses will be developed in stages, with the first off-the-plan release expected in spring. Mr Laner said he expected buyer demand to be strong, because it was the last of its kind.
