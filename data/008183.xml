  <title>Manager: Let me show you to the exit</title>
  <content>
A GUTSY pub manager has thwarted an early morning robbery attempt by chasing the thief out of a south Brisbane venue.
Video footage shows the offender walking into the Kensington Junction pub in Crestmead at about 4am.
Using an orange high vis vest to shield his face from security cameras, the man approaches the duty manager and makes demands for money.
Police said the 52-year-old duty manager then yells and chases the thief out of the venue.
The offender, described as caucasian and approximately 182cm tall, was last seen running towards Crescendo Place.
No money was obtained nor any weapon sighted.
No one was physically injured during the incident.
The Kensington Junction declined to comment.
