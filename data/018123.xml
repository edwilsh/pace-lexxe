  <title>Preview: Weight is right for Anecdote</title>
  <content>
TRAINER Ben Smith believes recent stable recruit Anecdote will maintain his perfect record at the track and distance in the Bengalla Cup (1280m) at Muswellbrook on Sunday.
The son of Lonhro has thrived in his three starts for the Broadmeadow-based Smith who has bonny mare In Her Time on a Group 1 trail this campaign.
In Her Time was runner-up in the Stradbroke then ran a luckless third in the Tatt's Tiara on June 24 before some time away from stable life.SHAYNE O'CASS'S BEST BETSMUSWELLBROOK
BEST BET: MUSICAL QUERY (Race 4, No. 2)
Has a superb set of figures to take this out, best of all being that she has a perfect record in two prior starts at this track and distance. Drawn one and has 1.5kg off for Mikayla Weir, who rode her to victory at Taree last start.
NEXT BEST: CAN I HAVE (Race 6, No. 3)
Ran second to main rival Anecdote here two runs back. Wasn't disgraced in town after that but will be much more comfortable at this track and grade.
VALUE: THE IRON MAIDEN (Race 5, No. 6)
Has scored just six wins from 67 starts but she races well at Muswellbrook, over this trip and when the tracks is soft. Great each-way play here.
JOCKEY TO FOLLOW
MIKAYLA WEIR has only three rides but Musical Query is our best on the card, while Prince High is tremendous each-way/place only value in the last race at $15.
SUGGESTED BETS
Quinella - Race 6, Nos. 3, 4
Duet - Race 5, Nos. 6, 10
QUADDIE
Race 4: 2, 9
Race 5: 6, 8, 9, 10
Race 6: 3, 4
Race 7: 2, 3, 10, 11

"She's done really well, I am a bit surprised how well she has come back to be honest,'' Smith said. "The Manikato was our first-up assignment but there is every chance she will have a run before that now. She's actually 24 kilos heavier than when she ran in the Tatt's so she's strengthened right up.''
As for Anecdote, his immediate goal is the $30,000 Bengalla Cup. The gelding will return to the scene of his Jerry's Plains Handicap (1300m) win from two starts back.
Anecdote beat a strong field that day, which included his main rival for the Bengalla Cup - Can I Have. Last start the seven-year-old finished a neck fourth of 14 runners in the Maclean Cup at Grafton but raced in restricted room late in the piece.
"He is a lovely horse and has done really well since he's come into the stable,'' Smith said.
"He just needed that first run but his next two were quite pleasing actually. He was a touch unlucky at Grafton but he's pulled up well. We've just backed his work off a little bit since and he's bouncing around the stables.
"Anecdote is very well weighted, we come in with 56kg and on current form that is a nice weight for him.''

Anecdote has been ridden at his past two runs by one of NSW's form jockeys in Josh Adams, who has five rides on the Muswellbrook card.
Apart from Anecdote, Adams will steer first-starter Sweers Island in the opener, Todd Howlett's major player in the third race - Dordogne - as well as Quick Cash (for Pat Farrell) and the Garry Frazer-trained Sweet Fella.
The best of the above would appear to be Dordogne who is knocking on the door for a win, having placed at half of his six starts.
Meanwhile, all eyes - and nearly all of the punter's money - will be on exciting filly Grasslands who resumes in the Schmetzer Racing 3YO Maiden Plate (1000m).
The China Horse Club-owned daughter of Snitzel is having her first run for new trainer Kris Lees, having previously been housed at Randwick with the now Hong Kong-based Michael Freedman.
Grasslands has raced three times, all of them in town, including her debut in the Gimcrack Stakes where she was beaten only 3 3/4 lengths by Godolphin filly Jorda.
