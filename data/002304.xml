  <title>Possible breakthrough in SA cold case</title>
  <content>
The unsolved disappearance of South Australian mother Gail King 20 years ago could be on the verge of a breakthrough, police say.
Ms King was reported missing in July 1997 after her partner, who is a suspect, said she left the duo's Yorke Peninsula property for Adelaide.
But police say they have recently been in contact with someone who has provided "a different taint" to the investigation, which is part of a wider review of cold cases.
