A DIRT bike rider has died after suffering a heart attack in bushland at Wallsend on Sunday.
A spokesman for the Hunter's Westpac Rescue Helicopter Service said they were called to a section of bush off the Newcastle Link Road about 12.40pm.
A doctor and paramedic were winched down into the crash site and the helicopter has landed on a nearby roundabout. 
Meanwhile, police are investigating after a fatal crash at Howes Valley, about 60 kilometres south-west of Singleton, on Sunday.

Police and emergency services were called to Putty Road about 1.50pm, following reports of a crash.
Initial inquiries suggest two vehicles have crashed head on, police said. 
A man was trapped and died at the scene.
A woman was treated by NSW Ambulance paramedics and taken to John Hunter Hospital.
Hunter Valley police are investigating and will prepare a report for the coroner.
