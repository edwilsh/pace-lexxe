  <title>Qld police appeal for info on missing man</title>
  <content>
Homicide police have launched a fresh appeal for information following the disappearance of a Queensland man two-and-a-half years ago.
Sam Robert Price-Purcell, also known as Sam Price, was last seen in the southeast of the state on February 16, 2015.
Both police and his family hold concerns for his welfare.
The Homicide Group's Detective Inspector Damien Hansen said on Friday the 28-year-old's disappearance was being treated as "suspicious".
He urged anyone with information about his movements in 2015 or his current whereabouts to contact police.
