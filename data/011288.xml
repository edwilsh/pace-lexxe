  <title>Major new development to transform Coast suburb</title>
  <content>
A MAJOR new village with shop and medical centre has been proposed for the last undeveloped block in the heart of one of the Coast's newest suburbs.
Mountain Creek's Brightwater estate looks set to welcome yet more new residents if a proposal for a new integrated care facility by Freedom Aged Care - part of The Aveo Group - is approved.
Freedom Aged Care specialises in retirement and assisted living for the elderly.
The care provider has proposed an 81-unit facility for the site bordered by Trevally St, Freshwater St and Brightwater Blvd.
Each unit would include a kitchen and laundry, but the proposed units would also be catered for with user-pay services provided by Freedom.
Once fully operational, the proposed facility - which is nestled between Brightwater State School, Brightwater Hotel and local shops on a vacant block used as a makeshift car park by parents - would employ up to 25 health care workers, catering staff, operation and administration staff.
The units would be spread over two levels, with 69 single-bed units and 12 one-bed, one-study units comprising the development, which also sits along a public transport route.
The first stage would deliver a restaurant, GP room, basement car park, shop (hairdresser) and medical centre, as well as 41 units, while the second stage of development would deliver 40 units and a sitting and outdoor deck on the ground and first levels.
Forty-one car parking spaces are proposed for the development, which would transform the existing 8380sq m vacant block.
The kitchen, dining room, lounge and bar aren't open to the public, although guests of residents would be welcome to use the facilities.
