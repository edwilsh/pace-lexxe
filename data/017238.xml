  <title>Sales skills were learnt on the job</title>
  <content>
BACK in the late 1990s, I started in real estate, working for Leading Edge in Nambour with great training from Mal Clarke.
You learnt on the job by driving around with the boss in his Fairlane and listening to his lines.
We mostly sold acreage and were a sourcing house of that for other agents across the Sunshine Coast.
An inspection with a buyer could take me from Cooroy to Landsborough and back again. I only lasted six months as it wore my car out. I also wanted to work in Buderim, where I lived, but it had been a great learning experience.
Back then, large acreage blocks were selling for around $90,000 and when buyers asked which direction was north, the standard reply was that the block was so large you could see north from anywhere on the land.
We did have the odd residential allotments for sale and I do remember clearly the frustration when one sale on a block at $30,000 was lost over an offer that was $300 less.
To be a genius in real estate you first have to buy something and then hold onto it. That land value would have gone up tenfold since then. If only ...
Everyone speaks about how much real estate has changed in the last few years and they're right. Smart phones, computers, digital log-ins and more make the process easier but in some ways more complicated.
Back in the day, agents were the font of all real estate knowledge collected by their own office sales and gossip written on the back of beer coasters.
Now apps supply the average buyer with sales stats and offer opinions, often without any understanding of the local conditions.
Still, at its heart, little has changed. Real estate is an emotional decision about the largest purchase most people will make in their life.
Buyers and sellers still speak the same language they did 20 years ago when I switched from retail to real estate. In fact, the most amazing thing about the industry is that, as an agent, you heard the same sentences over and over again.
It's as though buyers and sellers have all gone to the same school of negotiation.
"We don't have to sell, do we love?" a seller asks, while furtively looking to their partner for support.
"We'll know it when we see it," says the buyer, still looking years later.
But occasionally you get some gems, like this true conversation:
"Sorry, we won't be buying that home we have looked at three times and at all hours," Mrs Buyers replies to my call back.
"That's okay. On behalf of the owner, is there anything we can sort out for you that would change your opinion of the home," I bravely counter.
Mrs Buyers replies: "Look, I know this sounds strange but we wouldn't buy that home because my husband doesn't like the wife of the owner (exact words spoken)."
Stunned, I stammer back: "Can you let your husband know that the wife doesn't go with the chattels?"
Luckily, Mrs Buyer laughs: "Anyway, we don't like the inside paint colour and won't know what colour to change it to."
That was years ago.
But I assume that they are still looking and will know it when they see it.
