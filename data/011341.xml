  <title>Wattle Health set to raise $12.4m</title>
  <content>
Infant formula supplier Wattle Health has received commitments from institutional and sophisticated investors to take up new shares in a $12.4 million capital raising.
Wattle Health, which listed on the Australian share market in March, says the share placement was significantly oversubscribed, with the total bids received in excess of $20 million.
The proceeds will be used to fund Wattle Health's previously announced acquisition of an interest in Australian infant formula maker Blend & Pack and a joint-venture with Organic Dairy Farmers of Australia.
