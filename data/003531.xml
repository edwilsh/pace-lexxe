  <title>Defence contractor to build 225 combat vehicles in Melbourne if it wins $5 billion contract  </title>
  <content>
Defence contractor BAE Systems will build 225 combat vehicles at the old Holden factory in Melbourne if it wins a $5 billion contract.
The company is one of the short-listed bidders for the  AMV35 military vehicles, and it has chosen Victoria as the state it wants to build them in if it wins the deal.
"Victoria is the traditional home of vehicle manufacturing, and this project would create thousands of jobs at a time when our automotive sector is in transition," Premier Daniel Andrews said on Tuesday.
The Bushmaster and Hawkei vehicles are already being manufactured for the armed forces in Bendigo.
Victoria has signed an agreement with BAE to build the vehicles at the old Holden site in Fisherman's Bend.
The other bidder, German company Rheinmetall, has chosen Queensland as its preferred site if it wins the contract over BAE.

The contract is part of  LAND 400,  the biggest and most expensive acquisition project in the army's history, with an estimated  cost of between $14 and $20 billion.
that a letter signed by every federal Coalition MP in Victoria  was sent to BAE Systems, after the company was shortlisted under the project.

The MPs said Victoria's manufacturing skills, workforce capacity, supply chain and infrastructure were "unmatched by any other state".
 Mr Andrews said his message to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was "bring this work to Victoria".
"We have the expertise and track record needed to win this contract and build these vehicles," he said.
"This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to secure a future for our auto workers, create local jobs and protect our troops."
