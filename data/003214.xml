  <title>NSW woman died from violent sex act: court</title>
  <content>
Two men are standing trial over the death and violent sexual assault of a woman on a remote northern NSW beach six years ago.
Lynette Daley, 33, died from injuries sustained in the alleged sexual assault at Ten Mile Beach in January 2011, crown prosecutor Philip Strickland SC said at the NSW Supreme Court in Coffs Harbour on Monday.
Her "on-again-off-again" boyfriend Adrian Attwater, 42, has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and sexual assault.
His friend and co-accused Paul Maris, 47, has also pleaded not guilty to sexual assaulting the mother-of-seven and hindering the discovery of evidence.
The trio has been drinking "a lot of alcohol" on the camping trip and engaged in a sex act in the back of Maris' troop carrier, Mr Strickland said.
The crown alleges Attwater "repeatedly and vigorously" sexually assaulted Ms Daley who was too intoxicated to consent.
Attwater claimed Ms Daley died after having a fit or seizure in the ocean, Mr Strickland said.
