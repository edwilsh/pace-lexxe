  <title>Firefighters battle Moorabbin factory fire</title>
  <content>
ALMOST 30 firefighters are "aggressively attacking" an out-of-control factory fire in Melbourne's southeast
MFB spokesman Bruce Weaver said firefighters rushed to the Nelson St factory after receiving a number of 000 calls just after 9.30pm.
Mr Weaver said fire crews arrived and, after finding the factory well alight, requested extra fire trucks.
"Firefighters are aggressively attacking the fire with a combination of hand lines and an aerial appliance to ensure that the fire does not spread to the adjoining factory," Mr Weaver said.
A smoke warning has been issued for the west side of Chesterville Rd and residents have been told to avoid the area as the MFB will be at the scene for a number of hours.

Nelson St is closed.
Police and ambulance also attended the scene, with no injuries reported.
The cause is yet to be identified.
