  <title>Look out, Captain Cook Jet: Northbourne works lead to fountain</title>
  <content>
Canberra was treated to a water feature to rival the Captain Cook Jet during planned Icon Water works on â€‹Northbourne Avenue on Wednesday.
A glorious spray of water sprung forth from the ground, which was unrelated to the light rail project, a spokeswoman confirmed.Photo: Tish Karunarathna
Icon Water said the geyser was linked to planned works and happened when employees were trying to isolate a valve.
"These sorts of things with planned works is pretty common," a spokeswoman said.
For Tish Karunarathna, who snapped the jet of water on his way back to work from lunch with colleagues, the spectacle was "a bit of a LOL for the day".
"We just thought it was a funny little thing," Mr Karunarathna said.
"We joked Canberra was a city with two water fountains now."
Access Canberra confirmed WorkSafe ACT was on the site.
