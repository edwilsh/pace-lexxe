  <title>Parramatta Eels's Corey Norman says year from hell shaped team's charge to the finals</title>
  <content>
Parramatta five-eighth Corey Norman believes the resilience and willingness to compete throughout last year's salary cap scandal is the reason behind his team's success in 2017.
As the Eels continue to forge towards a top four finish after accounting for Canterbury on Thursday night, the hype around Parramatta is building with excitement on the back of six straight wins.

Eels notch sixth straight win

The Parramatta Eels continue their impressive form with a 20-4 win over the Canterbury Bulldogs.

It's a contrasting emotion to the corresponding period last year, when it seemed as though there would be no light at the end of a long and dark tunnel.
But Norman insists it's the fight and desire his team showed when they had nothing but pride on the line that has instilled a positive culture at a club that has long been criticised for its inability to breed success.

"Where we're sitting now has a lot to do with last year and the way we stuck together," Norman said.
"I don't know which round we found out all our points were gone and we were playing for nothing but the back end of last year we were playing our best football when our points weren't there.

"That has carried on this year. We were a bit patchy early but we're starting to find our feet at the right end of the season. The foundation that we laid last year within the group - we're a very tight group. It's on us and that definitely made us stronger last year and it is showing now."

Norman's combination with mid-season signing, Mitchell Moses, has blossomed over the past month. The Queenslander admits he has been crying out for a quality halves partner since joining the Eels in 2014 and had no issue when coach Brad Arthur came to him with Moses in mind as the club's recruitment target.Photo: Dominic Lorrimer
"He asked me and I said I was happy with Mitch. He is a good young player with a lot of footy in him," Norman said.
"There were a few other options and Brad went with Mitch. He has done a great job. Brad has been working with him and we're starting to get a good combination ourselves. It comes back to Brad. He has given us a good game plan.
"I have been in this side for four years. I have been here when it was going horrible. I have been asking for another quality half. We had Kieran [Foran] and he left. To get Mitch here I was excited. It takes a lot of pressure off me and makes us unpredictable. I was all for it and I was very excited to get working with Mitchy."
Despite growing up north of the border, four years of intense scrutiny and relentless external pressure has provided Norman with an appreciation of how much this year's likely finals berth means to the Parramatta faithful.
It's been eight years since the Eels last played finals football, and while the players and coach are doing their best to keep a lid on the hype, they know they are on the verge of something special.
"This club has been through some terrible times for a long time," Norman said.
"To give this club a finals hope is good. There is a real buzz around Parramatta. They are real loyal fans. The last couple of years they have always turned out to support us. We need to worry about getting there first. You never know. But is does mean a lot and we know it means a lot to the fans. They are very loyal.
"Timmy [Mannah] spoke about the '09 year (Eels reached the grand final). He reckons it is crazy around Parramatta. Hopefully we can have a good run in the finals. I think Parramatta will be buzzing for the next four weeks."
