  <title>Netball: Canberra keep unbeaten record with tight win against Belconenn</title>
  <content>
Canberra has maintained its undefeated record and position at the top of the State League netball competition with a hard fought wing against Belconnen 58-55 on Friday night.

Canberra coach Tara Steel said her side was made to fight hard for their seventh win in a row.
"I thought Belconnen came out really strongly and put us under a lot of pressure but to the girls credit they responded and finished the game strongly," Steel said.
"We were missing a couple of players which meant we ran some different combinations.
"In tight games like that you find out a lot about your players and I was pleased with how they fought hard for possession in the last term and our goal shooters converted the chances we created."

In other games, Arawang overcame a five goal half-time deficit to record a 53-45 win over a gallant Queanbeyan.
Arawang's Leigh Kalsbeek swung the game in her teams favour when she was moved to wing attack after half-time.
Her combination with Eliza Burton created numerous goal scoring opportunities, while defensively Hayley Mason and Millie Boehm were rock solid.
The defending champions Tuggeranong proved too strong for South Canberra, winning 63-42.
