  <title>Knights eager to offload spoon</title>
  <content>
KNIGHTS coach Nathan Brown admits he will be cheering every Wests Tigers loss between now and season's end as his team strives to avoid a third consecutive wooden spoon.

Last-placed Newcastle have given themselves hope of climbing out of the cellar with inspiring back-to-back wins against St George Illawarra (21-14) and the Warriors (26-10).
With four rounds remaining, they are two points behind the Tigers and will need at least one win from their remaining games - against Parramatta (away), Melbourne (home), Canberra (away) and Cronulla (home) - to finish ahead of the Tigers, who are realistically the only team they can catch.
The Tigers, who lost 28-14 to Penrith on Sunday, face Manly (home), Roosters (away), North Queensland (home) and the Warriors (home) in the last four rounds.
"We don't want to get the spoon, that's 100 per cent right ... I'll be death-riding the Tigers, for sure,'' Brown said. "But where we are this year now, compared to where we were last year, and the fact that the recruits we've made and the things we can do in the market, it wouldn't be a good wooden spoon to get, and it's one we don't want to get. But it will be a very different one to last year, that's for sure."
Warriors coach Stephen Kearney noted the enthusiasm with which Newcastle are playing, which stands in stark contrast to his own team, who have now lost five consecutive games.
"I thought the Knights played with a great deal of energy, obviously on the back of a good win last week for them,'' he said.
"You could sense that, with a bit of confidence under their belt, they came out with a real zest and we're just very disappointed we couldn't match it." 
It was the first time the Knights have won back-to-back games in almost two years, since rounds 23 and 24 of 2015, when they beat Wests Tigers and then Melbourne.

Lock Mitch Barnett, who had not scored a try in his previous 17 games this season, crashed over twice in the first 10 minutes to set up a 16-4 half-time lead for the home team. Tries by Lachlan Fitzgibbon (59th minute) and Brock Lamb (72nd minute) sealed the result. Lamb also set up Barnett's opening try and Fitzgibbon's four-pointer in a man-of-the-match display.

Knights winger Chanel Mata'utia is facing a $1500 fine for an attempted trip on Warriors half Lino Mason.
