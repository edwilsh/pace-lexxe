  <title>People are blasting Joe Scarborough for suggesting too many young people play video games instead of serving in wars</title>
  <content>
MSNBC's Joe Scarborough provoked a flurry of criticism online when he argued on Twitter that too few young people serve in the military, and play video games instead.

In a tweet on Monday, the "Morning Joe" host piggybacked off a reader comment on the American Conservative regarding American youth's "degradation into cocoons of social media, mental illness, porn, and disconnection from other people."

The tweet quickly sparked backlash online, as criticis alleged the MSNBC host was attempting to glorify horrific wars that left millions dead. Some pointed out that Scarborough declined to serve, and voted as a congressman to support the invasion of Iraq, where thousands of young Americans served. 

Scarborough responded several hours later, denying that he was advocating for additional armed conflicts.

Young men in the 1940s liberated Europe from Nazism and the Pacific from the Japanese Empire. Today, too many stay home playing video games.

I actually prefer to live in a world where the young can play games rather than die in wars. But that's just me.

If you'd get off your XBox & back away from your 3 fantasy baseball league computer screens you'd see data supports my Old Man concerns.
- Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC)

These are only millenials that neither you nor I personally know, and certainly none that follow me on Twitter or watch Morning Joe!
- Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC)

This is a typical response today to a long-stated concern about certain societal trends. The more subtle suggest I want wars with Nazis.
- Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC)

Actually, go on my Twitter mentions and you will be flooded with dumber, hotter takes suggesting I want millions to die in warfare.
- Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC)

The stupidity of these responses suggest an ignorance of current trends and the need to get out in the sun...which I am going to do now.????
