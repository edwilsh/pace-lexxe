  <title>Liberal MP slams colleagues pushing gay vote</title>

Conservative frontbencher Zed Seselja insists the government should not be adopting Labor policy on gay marriage having taken its plebiscite to the election.

12 MINS AGO  UPDATED JUST NOW

Turnbull government minister Zed Seselja has lashed calls for a parliamentary vote on gay marriage, insisting it's Labor policy.

"I haven't heard why we should be, one year after the election which we won, adopting Labor's policy," the conservative frontbencher told ABC radio on Tuesday.

Senator Seselja denied Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's leadership was under threat from a push by Liberal MPs pressing for a conscience vote to resolve the issue after the government's proposal for a plebiscite failed.
