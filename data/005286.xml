  <title>Sony Pictures cuts losses</title>
  <content>
Sony Pictures has reduced its losses in the three months to June but remains in the red.
Sales at Sony's film and TV operations were up 12 per cent at 203 billion yen ($A2.31 billion).
Revealing its figures for the first quarter of the April to March financial year, parent company, Sony Corporation said on Tuesday net profits nearly quadrupled in the three months to June.
Net profits hit 80.9 billion yen, compared with 21.2 billion yen in the same period last year. Sales revenue was up a healthy 15 per cent to $US16.6 billion ($A20.7 billion).
On Monday, the group announced Sony Pictures Television is to buy a substantial majority stake in US-based, English-language anime platform Funimation.
In April, when the group reported full year results for the 2016-17 financial year, Sony revised up its forecast for current year revenues.
It gave guidance of 8 trillion yen in sales and revenues and gave guidance of 255 billion yen net income for shareholders.
For the year to March 2017 it reported net income of 73.3 billion yen.
In 2016-17 the Pictures division reported a net loss of 80.5 billion yen. In large measure that reflected the $US962 million write-down of impaired goodwill.
