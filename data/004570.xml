  <title>Australia blows away its July daytime temperature record as rain stayed away</title>
  <content>
Australia smashed its daytime temperature records for July as another poor month for rainfall left skies relatively clear across the continent. 
The Bureau of Meteorology's monthly reports showed average maximum temperatures were 2.62 degrees above the long-run average, beating the previous record set in 1975 by a full two-thirds of a degree.

Al Gore: 'We are going to win' over climate change

Former US Vice President Al Gore continues to tirelessly fight climate change with An Inconvenient Sequel.

The bureau confirmed Sydney had its second-warmest July for maximums, with an average daytime top of 19.1 degrees, or 2.7 degrees above the norm.
In the city, 10 days exceeded 20 degrees during the month, or more than triple the long-term average of such days. The cool nights kept minimum temperatures generally below par.

Rainfall in the city was the least since 1995, with less than one-seventh the typical falls at 12.6 millimetres.
NSW as a whole posted its driest July since 2002, with rainfall totals 70 per cent below average. Daytime temperatures were also the second-warmest of record. All but four days in the month were warmer than normal for maximums, the bureau said.

Dominant high-pressure systems have limited the penetration of rain-bearing cold fronts beyond the southern coast for most of the past two months, with little sign of the pattern breaking up.

A similar story was true south of the border, with Victoria marking its second-driest start to winter in more than a century of records. June-July rainfall totals are the lowest for any year except 1982, backing up its record dry June.Photo: Justin McManus
After a cool start to July with several stations in Melbourne registering their coldest nights since 1997, temperatures the city were generally warmer than average particularly towards the end of the month.

"Average maximum temperatures were the highest on record for July over large parts of Queensland, Northern Territory and the northern half of Western Australia, with all three regions recording their warmest July days on record as a whole," the bureau said. 
Queensland's warmest July on record for maximums beat a record set in 1915, while the NT's tally beat the previous record notched in 1975 by 0.84 degrees.
While the first half of July was particularly frosty for parts of inland regions - with some southern NSW and Victorian sites recording their coldest nights - overall minimum temperatures came in 1 degree warmer than usual for the month.
Nationally, Australia averaged 13.5 millimetres of rain, 39 per cent below average. 
The Murray-Darling Basin, a key foodbowl region, reported another poor month, with rainfall less than half the average.
As the bureau chart below shows, the largest rain anomalies were across southern Australia, while the NT recorded some out-of-season rain.

The bureau's outlook for August-October indicates the odds favour continuing warmer and drier than averge conditions across southern Australia.
