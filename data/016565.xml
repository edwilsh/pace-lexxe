  <title>Calls to get tough on road rage drivers as shocking footage emerges of alleged attack</title>
  <content>
There are calls for tougher penalties for road rage drivers as more footage emerges of violent behaviour on Australia's roads.
Road safety expert Russell White told A Current Affair road rage needed to have specific legislation dedicated to stamping it out.
"It is a sad reality that we're actually seeing these sorts of things occur far more often," Mr White said.
"I think they're happening more often and we're actually seeing them more often because they're being recorded."
Mr White said changes needed to be made.
"I think we've got to give far more power to the law agencies to actually target road rage as a specific anti-social behaviour and get harsh penalties for people who engage in this sort of thing," he said.
Driver John Wood is one of many Australians who claims to have been the victim of a road rage attack.

He said after honking his horn at another driver, that driver purposely crossed into his lane and collided with his car.
"He became aggressive, ran across the motorway, kicked my door, yanked my door - I had to block it," he said.
"I had swelling to my arm and a cut."
Mr Wood said police had tried to prevent him from pressing charges against the other driver - who claimed he had not caused the accident.
Ultimately, Mr Wood said both cars were written off and his insurance paid him out.
He said police told him that without video of the lead-up to the crash, it was not worth taking action against the other driver.
"What kind of an example are we setting for society when someone can get away with dangerous driving?" he said.
