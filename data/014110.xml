  <title>Shorten demands referendum body</title>
  <content>
Opposition leader Bill Shorten has called for a joint parliamentary select committee to finalise a referendum question on Aboriginal constitutional reform.
In a letter sent to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, the Labor leader confirmed his party's support for an indigenous advisory body, and proposed the immediate establishment of a bipartisan parliamentary process to work towards it.
Such a committee would allow other proposals outlined in the Referendum Council's Uluru Statement from the Heart, including a treaty-making mechanism and reconciliation process, to be advanced.
