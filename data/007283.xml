  <title>Kendall stuns in topless lingerie shoot</title>
  <content>
KENDALL Jenner has posed topless for her latest lingerie campaign - wearing only a pair of red lace knickers.
The Victoria's Secret model is pictured braless and wearing a G-string in her new La Perla campaign.
It's the latest in a long line of sexy shoots for the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 21.
This week, she wore Sydney-based label Bec and Bridge in New York, sans bra, while out in Soho with her BFF, Bella Hadid.
KENDALL'S NEW CAMPAIGN

Jenner has spoken previously about why she just doesn't feel the need to wear a bra, saying she "really just doesn't care".
"I'm not embarrassed by my body," Jenner said.
"I really don't see what the big deal is with going braless!," Jenner wrote on her blog last year, in a post titled "Free The Nipple".
"It's sexy, it's comfortable and I'm cool with my breasts. That's it!" Jenner said.
"It's also a fun way to show off my different nipple rings! I think it's cool and I really just don't care."
She famously wore a see-through dress by La Perla to the Met Ball in May.
