  <title>Match preview: Greater Western Sydney v Melbourne</title>
  <content>
Jack Viney will lock horns with Josh Kelly and his fellow Giants again on Saturday

SUMMARY
The Giants found a way to get past Fremantle last week for their first win since round 14 and while they weren't exactly convincing, it was a valuable four points. They'll need to find even more momentum to get past Melbourne, a side coming off a disappointing loss to 17th-ranked North Melbourne in Tasmania. GWS will relish the chance to get down to Canberra for a 'home' game, having won seven of its past eight matches at the venue, and the clash will show off some of the competition's brightest young stars. Both sides are missing their key forwards with Jeremy Cameron (hamstring) and Jesse Hogan (collarbone) sidelined, but Josh Kelly, Stephen Coniglio, Dylan Shiel and Lachie Whitfield will go head to head with Jack Viney, Clayton Oliver, Christian Petracca and former Giant Dom Tyson. Fans are in for a treat, and with so much on the line in terms of ladder positioning, it's one of the most important matches of the season.

THE SIX POINTS
1. These teams last played way back in round one, 2016 when the Giants went into the final quarter 21 points in front, before the Demons kicked six goals to two in the fourth quarter. Jack Viney collected the three Brownlow votes with 32 disposals and six tackles.

2. This will be a contest between two of the best clearance teams this season. The Giants are ranked first with an average of 42.3 per game, just ahead of the Demons, who are third at 38.8.

3. GWS and Melbourne meet for the 10th time with the Demons holding a narrow advantage, winning five games to four. Four games have been decided by more than 40 points.

4. The Demons have been one of the strongest contested possession teams this season, ranked second with 153.7 per game, well ahead of the Giants who are ranked eighth with 143.5.

5. The Giants are undefeated at UNSW Canberra Oval this season from two matches, in which they defeated Port Adelaide and the Western Bulldogs. Melbourne has played six times in Canberra for two wins.

6. Melbourne young gun Christian Petracca continues to rise up the rankings in the Schick AFL Player Ratings, with the Demon now ranked 66th after starting the season at 312th. 

IT'S A BIG WEEK FOR...
Tom McDonald. Even more responsibility falls on McDonald's shoulders with Jesse Hogan missing with a broken collarbone, and the defender-turned-forward needs to continue to provide his team with a strong target inside 50.

PREDICTION: Greater Western Sydney by seven points
