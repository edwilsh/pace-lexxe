  <title>Melbourne's four proposed toll road routes</title>
  <content>
Four proposed routes for Melbourne's "missing link" freeway have been put forward with a recommendation for the preferred option expected by the end of the year.
The North East Link will complete the Metropolitan Ring Road by connecting the ring road to either the Eastern Freeway or EastLink.
All four options involve tunnels, with the cost per kilometre of tunnel expected to be between $800 million and $1 billion.
