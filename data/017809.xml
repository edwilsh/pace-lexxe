  <title>Commonwealth Games: Weightlifting's popularity soaring ahead of Gold Coast event</title>
  <content>
Once seen a male dominated sport, tailoring to a niche market, weightlifting is pushing its way into mainstream Australia ahead of the Commonwealth Games.
Long-time weightlifting coach Angela Wydall said the sport has grown ten-fold since she began coaching in the 1990's, with more women than ever before signing up.
"Twenty years ago we used to go and do demos in shopping centres and beg people to come and have a go at weightlifting and now we're just inundated, we can't cope with the demand," said Ms Wydall.
"We get a lot of interest from the CrossFit community in particular, and sometimes people cross-training for other sports like athletics, swimming, cycling or football."
Alyce Stephenson says CrossFit, a commercial fitness franchise that mixes elements of weightlifting with gymnastics and high-intensity training, is how she discovered lifting.
Competing in the 48 kilogram weight category, she is on track to make the team for the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast next year.

"It would be an absolute honour (making the Commonwealth Games). It would be the highest achievement I've ever achieved in my whole life probably, so really looking forward to the next six months of training."
With excitement building on what the next generation of Australian weightlifters might achieve, two veterans of the sport are not ready to step aside just yet.
Damon Kelly and Erika Yamasaki are Australia's best hopes for a medal in weightlifting at the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast next year.
"I want to win the gold medal next year," Kelly said.
"That's the big goal, just be really competitive and make sure that if not gold definitely on the dais."
Kelly already won a gold medal at the 2010 Commonwealth games in Delhi.
"I'm the old grandad of the super heavyweight body class and I really do have my work cut out for me to try and get on top of those guys but I'm hoping my experience counts for something."

For Erika Yamasaki, who competes in the 53kg category, just making the Commonwealth Games team will be a huge achievement.
"I had five bulging discs and then two of them ruptured," said Yamasaki.
"That put me out for probably two months and then unfortunately during training I dropped the bar on my left knee and caused a hematoma and bruised boning."
But thanks to a new found focus and training regime Yamasaki is now training better than ever.
"Mainly it's doing a lot of recovery so sauna and ice bath, as well as a lot of conditioning work and stretching," she said.
The final competition for Commonwealth Games qualification in weightlifting will take place in December.
