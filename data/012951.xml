  <title>Aussie call for veteran at age 70</title>

REP HONOURS: Upper Hunter Men of League welfare officer Tony Witt.

A YOUNG whippersnapper has jumped at the chance to represent his country again - at the ripe age of 70.
Tony Witt, of Muswelbrook, will don the "green and gold" for the Masters of Rugby League Australia over-35 side, which tours England in February.
The squad is scheduled to contest about six matches overseas, including one Test against Great Britain.
"Even though I've played four games [for Australia], it was still a bit of a shock to get selected," he said. "The team is made up of various age groups. I was asked if I would be available to go to England, so I jumped at the chance."
However, the representative honours don't end there for the Upper Hunter Men of League welfare officer.
"Yes, I'm going to New Zealand in November for the World Masters," Witt said. "But, not with Australia - I'm an invitational player for the Scottish outfit.
"It's the first time they've had a side in the event. So, it's an honour to take the field with them."
