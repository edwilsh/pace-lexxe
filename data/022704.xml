  <title>'Worst turbulence ever': Ten people injured as American Airline's jet turns into flight from hell</title>
  <content>
Passengers were sent flying and drinks hit the cabin ceiling as an American Airlines jet struck turbulence so severe one man thought the plane was about to plummet from the sky.

Three passengers and seven crew members had to be taken to hospital after the jet carrying 287 people from Greece to Philadelphia landed safely on Sunday.

Flight crew had just served last drinks on American Airlines Flight 759 ahead of preparations to land when passengers were suddenly warned to fasten seatbelts.

People on their feet were told to immediately return to their seats but passengers said nobody had time to react or prepare for what was coming.

Alex Ehmke told  everything in front of him rose more than a metre in the air, like a Hollywood special effect.

"It felt like the whole plane was in free fall," Ehmke recounted.

"I saw all the drinks fly up at once."

It momentarily felt like the plane was about to fall from the sky, Ehmke told .

Ehmke's wife posted several photos on Twitter that showed coffee and drinks dripping from the cabin ceiling.

A  by Ervan Fang, captioned "worst turbulence ever", documented the aftermath of the jet's violent lurch towards the ground.

Fang's video shows the aisle littered with debris and a startled woman holding her face in her hands; somewhere in the cabin a baby is crying.

As passengers begin to pick up their belongings and compose themselves, Fang's footage captures the American Airlines captain making an apology on the jet's PA system.

"We were expecting some light turbulence, the plane in front of us didn't report anything," the captain says.

"That was totally unexpected. We've asked the cabin crew to take an assessment of everyone and make sure everyone is okay."

Alex Ehmke told The Washington Post that when a crew member later took the microphone to prepare passengers for landing that "it was the most shaken I've ever heard flight staff sound".

The plane landed safely in Philadelphia 30 minutes after hitting turbulence.

No details were provided by American Airlines about the nature of the 10 people's injuries, but the carrier said everybody affected had been discharged from hospital by Monday.

The airline added it wanted to "thank our team members for keeping our passengers safe."
