6 MINS AGO 

In a post on the Facebook page of Texas tourism company Hill Country Visitor, staff noted the similarities between Simmons' black-and-white face paint and long tongue, and the newborn calf named Genie, who was born on a ranch in the locality.

"Gene Simmons, where were you on or about November 25, 2016?" they joked.

"This calf was born in Kerrville, Texas, on the ranch of a Heather Leonard Taccetta who works at Cowboy Steakhouse.

"Now obviously we can't serve this fine specimen. We may just keep Genie, as we call her, as a mascot for the Steakhouse."

The calf's owner says she listens to KISS, and the tourism company has invited Simmons himself to come and take a look at his doppelganger.

"We'll treat you to the best steaks in Texas!" they promised.

The rocker, who's known for hits I Was Made For Lovin' You and Detroit Rock City, even took to social media to say "this is real folks!"

This is real, folks!!! Calf called Genie is born on Texas ranch and looks EXACTLY like Kiss rocker Gene Simmons
