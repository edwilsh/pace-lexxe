  <title>US army father surprises his daughter with early homecoming</title>
  <content>
For Kristi Flury, lending a hand at a dolphin show was a dream come true when she was picked out of a crowd at a Chicago zoo on Thursday.
But the 12-year-old from Illnois received something even greater when her father, a captain in the US Army Reserves, staged an early homecoming.
Video has captured the moment Josh Flury surprised his daughter at Chicago's Brookfield Zoo after returning home early from a nine-month deployment in Kuwait.
Kristi and her mother were standing in front of a crowd with their backs when the army corporal showed up unannounced.
"My favourite moment was seeing him come out and just seeing him home," Kristi, who sprinted to greet her dad after enduring his second deployment,
"I'm excited to catch him up on how things have been going here and show him all the cool things I've learned and just welcome home."
