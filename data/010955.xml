HE'S no stranger to a controversial comment or two.
So it's no surprise Rodrigo Duterte didn't hold back when discussing his North Korean counterpart yesterday.
Not only did he slam Kim Jong-un over his nuclear weapons program, but he also commented on his appearance.
The firebrand Philippine President described the North Korean leader as a "fool" and a "son of a b***" days before hosting an international meeting certain to address Pyongyang's long-range missile tests.
Duterte also rebuked Kim for "playing with dangerous toys", setting the stage for next week's rare get-together to be attended by foreign ministers of all the countries involved in the stand-off on the Korean peninsula.
"This Kim Jong-un, a fool ... he is playing with dangerous toys, that fool," Duterte told tax officials in a speech, Reuters reported.
The outspoken president didn't stop there.

"That chubby face that looks kind. That son of a b****. If he commits a mistake, the Far East will become an arid land.
"It must be stopped, this nuclear war. A limited confrontation and it blows up here, I will tell you, the fallout can deplete the soil, the resources and I don't know what will happen to us."

North Korea is determined to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States and officials in Washington say Saturday's test of an intercontinental ballistic missile shows it may be able to reach most of the country.
This year, Duterte is chairman of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and on Monday his foreign minister will host the ASEAN Regional Forum, which brings together 27 countries that include Australia, China, India, Japan, Russia, North and South Korea and the United States.
This wouldn't be the first time Duterte has revealed what he thinks about Kim Jong-un.
In  of a telephone conversation held between Duterte and US President Donald Trump in May, he calls Kim "crazy" and said the world isn't safe as long as he has rockets.
"He is not stable, Mr President, as he keeps on smiling when he explodes a rocket," he told Mr Trump.
"It seems from his face he is laughing always and there's a dangerous toy in his hands which could create so much agony and suffering for all mankind."

He also said every generation had a madman and this one had Kim Jong-un.
Duterte is renowned for using colourful language against those he doesn't like or his critics.
In September last year  and over the killing of suspected drug dealers.
"I have read the condemnation of the European Union. I'm telling them, 'F**k you,'" he said.
"You should look at history books, encyclopaedia of events. Britain, France has the gall to condemn me. Again, I repeat it, f**ck you."
He also called Barack Obama a "son of a wh*re" as he vowed not to be lectured by the former US leader on human rights.
