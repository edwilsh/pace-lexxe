  <title>Heke jury to continue deliberations</title>
  <content>
A Queensland jury will resume its deliberations for a New Zealander accused of punching a man during a roadside scuffle and causing him to fall back and into the path of an oncoming truck.
On Friday morning the Brisbane Supreme Court jury retired to consider its verdict for Tamate Henry Heke, who is fighting allegations he unlawfully killed Shane Merrigan.
He's accused of dealing the 50-year-old a "heavy blow" before he was fatally hit by a rubbish truck on the Gateway Motorway at Eight Mile Plains on December 1, 2015.
He has pleaded not guilty to a charge of manslaughter, as well as to an alternative charge of unlawful striking causing death.
Deliberations continue on Monday.
