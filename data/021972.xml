FORGET crop circles - a trolley circle has been discovered in Armidale.
The "mysterious" ring of trolleys was found in the Armidale Central Shopping Centre car park on Saturday morning.
The incident caused a stir online, with hundreds of comments from locals who described the structure as "brilliant", "legendary" and a "beautiful work of art".

Matthew Korodi suggested the event could have been a "satanic trolley ritual" while RJ Andrews said it was "aliens" who caused the formation.

May Zarb took a sociological approach.

"It's surely a post modern expression of the never ending cycle of consumerism society is suffering," she said.
Meanwhile, Marion Campbell took the opportunity to applaud Woolworths on the structure of their trolleys.

"I want to make a different comment on Woolies trolleys while they are in the news," she said.

"I have wanted to congratulate Woolies for a while now on supplying so many of the smaller type trolley ... well done.

"They are so much easier to use and as an older member of the community I applaud you."

Armidale Central management were unable to comment on the incident when contacted by The Express on Monday.
