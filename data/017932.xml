  <title>Japan's futuristic airport hotel lets you rent tiny pods for power naps</title>
  <content>
There aren't many frills at the  hotel, but when you're only staying for a nap or a layover between flights, soft sheets and a dark space are pretty much all you need.

Nine Hours is a Japanese chain of pod hotels started in 2009, with each chain designed to accommodate people for between one and nine hours depending on their needs.

For $US44, guests gain access to a private pod, sleepwear, and access to the bathrooms and lounge. Or for $US7 you can just take a shower.

Here's what the express hotel is all about.
