Australia has had its warmest July on record, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) has said.
A BOM report to be released later today will show the country's average July temperature was at its highest in more than 100 years, forecaster David Crock said.
"The warmest parts have been through Queensland, Northern Territory, northern Western Australia and New South Wales," he said.
"The month has been dominated - at least in eastern Australia - by a ridge of high pressure which has seen very clear skies and a warm air mass sit over the country for days and weeks at a time.
"The inland areas have certainly been warmer away from the cooling influence of the ocean ... but certainly some of the temperature anomalies extend right across northern Australia.
"Queensland had its warmest July on record for both maximum and minimum temperatures across the whole state - parts of Queensland have been very dry."
Mr Crock said temperatures had remained warm because the high-pressure system prevented cold fronts moving north from Victoria and NSW.
BOM meteorologist Greg Browning said it was "basically this background warming signal that we're seeing right across the globe associated with global warming".
"It seems like the warming conditions we've seen right across the globe are just becoming commonplace, and we're seeing them in monthly temperatures on a regular basis."
In the Northern Territory, the  - the mercury was the highest it had been in July since records began more than 100 years ago.
Those in Darwin also sweltered through the nights with only six overnight lows under 20C, while the average for July is 18.5 nights below 20C.
