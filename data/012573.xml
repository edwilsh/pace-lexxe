WHY THE HYPE?
Floyd Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor is a 12-round super welterweight matchup that pits the legendary boxer Mayweather against the all-time MMA great McGregor in an unprecedented event that takes place Saturday, August 26 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.
The event telecast is produced and distributed by SHOWTIME PPV and promoted by Mayweather Promotions.WHAT'S THE STORY?
FEW experts give Conor McGregor a chance.
Even McGregor diehards would doubt his ability to do what no one else has done - defeat Floyd Mayweather.
But there's no doubting the Irishman's inner belief that he can stun the world and punish "Money" Mayweather into retirement.
"He will be unconsciousness in four rounds," McGregor told the Los Angeles crowd in the first stop of a four-city media tour.
"He has never faced this."
The pair will square off on August 27 in what's arguably the "Fight of the Century".
Forget the Mayweather-Pacquiao scrap in May that broke the bank, this will smash pay-per-view records.
It's estimated the fight will make about $606.1 million.
To put that into context, the Mayweather vs. Pacquiao bout sold an astounding 4.6 million PPV buys.
Mayweather and McGregor will be swimming in the money, too, pocketing millions.
Mayweather stands to earn $100 million, while McGregor will make $75m.
McGregor has a net worth of $34m, according to Forbes, earning $27m through winnings and a further $7m in endorsements.
Just add another zero for Mayweather.
As of December 2016, Forbes estimated the champ has earnt $340m, making him the world's highest paid athlete for three of the last four years.
The mouth-watering bout is destined to put bums on seats worldwide.
Even the casual punter will tune in, eager to see how the king of the ring fares against the lord of the octagon.
For what it's worth, I can't see how McGregor stands a chance against the 49-0 Mayweather.
He's undefeated for a reason, and while in the twilight of his career at 40-years-of-age, he boasts lighting speed and power that McGregor has never encountered in his 24-fight career.
"The Notorious", a dual-division champion in the UFC, drops bombs and Mayweather won't want to be on the end of McGregor's overhand left.
But the question is, can he land a glove on the crafty counterpuncher?
I doubt it.
One thing's for certain, boxing is the only way for this pair to settle this argument.
Inside the cage with four-ounce UFC gloves, Mayweather doesn't stand a chance.
In fact, McGregor would choke him out inside a minute.
At least in the ring, we've got a spectacle. And it can't come quick enough.WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
Mayweather: "I don't care if it's a ring or it's an octagon, I will kick ass. I don't back down for anybody.
"You line them up and I will knock them down. On August 26, I'm gonna knock this b---- out too."
McGregor: "I am honoured to be here, to give you this spectacle.
"His little legs, his little core, his little head, I am going to knock him out inside four rounds, mark my words.
"He will be unconsciousness in four rounds. He has never faced this. I don't fear him.
"All these rules, all these restrictions, it doesn't faze me; it amuses me. It is funny to me all these rules.
"All I need is a gum shield. Line me up to the ring and I am good to go."THE NUMBERS
Floyd Mayweather
Age: 40
Origin: Grand Rapids, Michigan
Nickname: Moneu
Height: 5ft 8"
Stance: Orthodox
Record: 49-0, 26 knockouts
Reach: 72"
Bio: With an unblemished 49-0 professional boxing record, Mayweather retired in 2015.
He is regarded as one of the best defensive fighters ever, and prides himself on his ability to evade punishment with his skilful movement about the ring.
Conor McGregor
Age: 29
Origin: Dublin, Ireland
Nickname: The Notorious
Height: 5ft 9"
Stance: Southpaw
Record: 21-3 18 knockouts
Reach: 74"
Bio: McGregor, the UFC's reigning lightweight champion and former featherweight champion, is known as much for his bravado as for his explosive knockout power inside an MMA octagon.
An Irish icon, McGregor is one of the highest earning MMA fighters.
He earned an estimated $10m fighting American Nate Diaz, even though he lost.RULES OF THE FIGHT
Here's an interesting one.
The fight will be held under boxing rules, but after initially agreeing to use 10-ounce boxing gloves - instead of the smaller UFC gloves - there's been a late change.
, a move many think is giving McGregor a huge boost.
The Irishman is desperate to have as little padding as possible - improving his odds of scoring a KO victory when they meet on August 26.
McGregor will not be allowed to use the leg kicks or take-downs that are used in mixed martial arts.
