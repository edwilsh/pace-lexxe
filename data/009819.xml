  <title>Sydney FC make FFA Cup history, Central Coast Mariners out</title>
  <content>
Sydney FC have strolled to the biggest win in FFA Cup history, while Central Coast have again been sent packing by state-league opposition in the round of 32.

Twenty-three goals were scored across the four games, easily eclipsing the previous mark of 18 in one match day.
A ruthless Sky Blues set the tone up north, wiping the floor with the Darwin Rovers 8-0 to set a record for most goals scored and biggest winning margin in any game from the round of 32 onwards.
While still early in the A-League pre-season, Graham Arnold's reigning premiers and champions showed they meant business in their quest to hold all three domestic trophies this calendar year.
No player more so than Brazilian striker Bobo, whose quartet of goals equalled Matt Sim's 2014 record of four in a single match - even in the absence of key trio Brandon O'Neill, Alex Wilkinson and captain Alex Brosque.

In Sydney, Central Coast coach Paul Okon endured a difficult start to his second season in charge after the Mariners became the third A-League club to exit via a 3-2 loss to Blacktown City. Wellington were knocked out on Tuesday night in extra time by Western Sydney, while Heidelberg United eliminated Perth.
A year after their 2016 round-of-32 loss to Green Gully spelt the end of former coach Tony Walmsley's tenure, the Mariners again fell victim to lesser competition.
Kwabena Appiah twice brought Okon's men back from behind, but they finally came undone to the NSW NPL leaders when Gosford-born former Western Sydney striker Joey Gibbs netted his second in the 82nd minute.
Blacktown, who made it to last year's quarter-finals before losing to Sydney FC, are the fifth state-level side in the tournament's history to upset an A-League team after Heidelberg's win over the Glory.
In Queensland, Gold Coast City accounted for Western Knights 3-1 thanks to Jarrod Kyle's hat-trick, while Moreton Bay United defeated Broadmeadow Magic 4-2 in extra time.
