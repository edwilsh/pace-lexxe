  <title>Dancers show off skills at Toowoomba Eisteddfod</title>
  <content>
Dance is a way of life:

SOFIA Sanson-Male looked like a perfect princess as she channelled life as a royal during the Year 1 and under character poem solo section at the 72nd City of Toowoomba Eisteddfod yesterday.

Dressed in her prettiest blue sparkly princess dress, the Year 1 student from Toowoomba Anglican College and Preparatory School took to the stage in the Empire Theatre's Armitage Centre's Heritage Bank Auditorium to perform.

"I wasn't scared because I had lots of fun," she said.

Sofia's performance won her a highly commended certificate from adjudicator June Finney, who is the principal examiner in speech and drama in Queensland for the Australian Music Examinations Board and the vice-president of the Communication, Speech and Performance Teachers.

Sofia said she was very excited to have won the certificate.
Hip Hop at the Empire:

Dance sections of the competition ended yesterday and the speech and drama sections began.

City of Eisteddfod president and dance convener Gabby Elliot said it had been a fantastic three days of dance and the performances in the open sections had been outstanding.
