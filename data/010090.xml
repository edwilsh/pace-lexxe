  <title>The Weirdest Two Minutes Of Your Day Will Be Spent Watching David Lynch's Intro To Twin Peaks' Comic-Con Panel</title>
  <content>

The footage has finally made its way online, and, well... you should just stop what you're doing and watch it right now. The 13th instalment of Twin Peaks: The Return will be available Monday on Stan.
