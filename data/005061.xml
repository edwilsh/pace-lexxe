The Revival Meeting is the name of their new album, but My Friend The Chocolate Cake were playing to the converted on Friday night.
If there were any non-believers at a packed Lizotte's, they were soon swept away by the charisma of this tight outfit, who have been playing for 28 years.

Proceedings started low-key with just David Bridie and the band's string section - Helen Mountfort (cello) and Hope Cstoros (violin) - introducing Poke Along Slowly. The three other Cake members - Greg Patten (drums), Andrew Richardson (guitar) and Dean Addison (double bass) - appeared, and things were kicked up a notch, with mostly new material mixed expertly with Cake favourites, I Got A Plan and It's All In the Way.
The second half really belonged to the 'Chocolate Cake Girls', Mountfort and Cstoros, as their gorgeous arrangements set the pace, from oh-so-quiet to break-neck speed.
Bridie also charmed the socks off everyone with his observations on all manner of subjects, including Pauline Hanson, the general populace being glued to their mobile phones and the joys of PNG's culture. Stori Rabaul, even sparked some righteous dance moves by the lanky frontman. He said later that his bandmates often cautioned him against having a jig, as he was a "shit dancer".

Let's say his efforts were akin to 'dad dancing', but delivered with such unbridled joy that it made you want to join in.

Unbridled Bridie was adorable.

There was also a hearty singalong to Easter Parade (audience's line: "Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition"), in which Newcastle's efforts were judged better than Coffs Harbour's. 
The night ended with the touching encore, Jim's Refrain, a tribute to Cake founding member Andrew Carswell, who passed away last year.

The Cake family then joined hands for a final bow, closing what was an inspiring, joyful, touching and deeply satisfying performance.

Hallelujah, all praise The Cake.
