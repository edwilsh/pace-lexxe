  <title>Brisbane school rocked by sex abuse claim</title>
  <content>
A Catholic girls' school in Brisbane has become the latest institution to be rocked by reports of the historical sexual abuse of one of its students.
Mt St Michael's College principal Sharon Volp emailed a letter to current and former students on Monday confirming it had received a "formal complaint" about the actions of a former staff member in 1976-78.
Ms Volp said the matter had been referred to police but urged anyone with similar concerns to come forward and contact the school.
