  <title>Ex-Queensland education boss on trial for nepotism</title>

A former Queensland education boss allegedly used "unspoken pressure" to secure a job for a friend of the department's director-general Julie Grantham.

It is alleged Mr Hoppner told his subordinate David Morgan in June 2012 to offer a job at a state-run sports centre to Hunter Paltridge before interviewing other candidates.
The court heard on Monday that Mr Morgan was chair of a panel responsible for appointing the new Head of Programs at the Runaway Bay Sport and Leadership Excellence Centre.
Mr Morgan said he had an hour-long meeting with Mr Paltridge about the job at Ms Grantham's house in May 2012.
Ms Grantham's husband Neil, who also worked at the centre, was at that meeting and had been the one to suggest Mr Paltridge would be interested in the position.

The court heard Mr Paltridge's application was submitted after the deadline via an email chain from Mr Hoppner and Ms Grantham.
Mr Morgan said he shortlisted Mr Paltridge for the job because he felt "a fair bit of pressure" to include him in the process, despite scoring lower than the other top candidates.

Mr Hoppner is alleged to have called Mr Morgan on June 14 to stress the importance of hiring Mr Paltridge before an important meeting between Ms Grantham and the head of Gold Cost TAFE, where Mr Paltridge worked.
During a call the following day, Mr Morgan said Mr Hoppner told him again to appoint Mr Paltridge immediately because he was "the man for the job".
"(He said) you can basically shoulder tap them and put them in," he said.
Mr Paltridge accepted the job and is not accused of any wrongdoing.
Defence barrister Saul Holt, QC, told the jury in his opening statement the only person who "behaved badly" was Mr Morgan.
The trial continues.
