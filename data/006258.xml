  <title>Get behind the Rovers tonight</title>
  <content>
IT'S the football competition that has changed Australia and Territorians will get their slice of the cake at Darwin Football Stadium tonight.
The nationwide FFA Cup competition is in town and the Darwin Rovers are our team, for a day at least.
The big problem for the Rovers, a healthy mix of Englishmen and Irishmen, is their opponents, A-League champions Sydney FC.
The "Sky Blues'' are made up of big names like Bobo, Milos Ninkovic and Socceroo David Carney - players that had big parts to play in filling the club's trophy cabinet last season.
Sydney's manager Graham Arnold told the Darwin media yesterday his players had trained in spray jackets all week to prepare themselves for the Top End's heat and humidity.
That could work for the part-timers from the Rovers, who boast self-employed carpenters, plumbers, cable layers and electricians as their marquee players, all of them used to the sweat that running around in Darwin seems to encourage.
One half of Darwin's Greek clubs have fallen at the Round of 32 hurdle - Darwin Olympic conceding six goals to Adelaide United.
The Rovers were called Shamrock when they crashed to Queensland state league side Brisbane Strikers last year. But they replaced the Irish theme with Darwin earlier this year, a move that will gain an extra 2000 fans at the home of Top End soccer tonight.
The FFA Cup kicked off with 735 teams from across the country in May. Now it is down to 32 in the race for the final in the last week of November.
It is a competition that pits tradies against millionaires, butchers against bankers and labourers against toffs. A creation that has brought the country together and added more spice to the sport the late Les Murray dubbed the "World Game''.
