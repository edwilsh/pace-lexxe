  <title>Crown building warchest but capital management not priority No.1, Citi says</title>
  <content>
Crown Resorts will have up to $2 billion debt capacity in coming years, but that isn't necessarily a signal of near term capital management measures. 
Following Crown's annual results, Citi analysts reckon Crown's net debt will be worth only 0.2-times earnings come this time next year, and 0.5-times by the end of the 2020 financial year. 
That means $1.7 billion to $2 billion debt capacity, assuming a 2.5-times net debt-to-earnings limit. 
While those gearing forecasts are a sharp reduction on Crown's historical levels, Citi reckons shareholders should not expect a step-up in buybacks, special dividends and other capital management initiatives. 

Instead, Crown seems to be preparing for a ramp up in capital expenditure for its expansion into Sydney worth $2.3 billion on a gross basis and $1.7 billion net of apartment sales, on Citi's numbers. 

"We no longer anticipate further near term capital management for CWN in addition to the buyback," Citi analysts told clients following . 
Crown's result did include a $375 million odd on-market share buyback, however it was less than analysts and fund managers had expected.
