  <title>Webjet shares up after $93m cap raising</title>
  <content>
Shares in online travel agency Webjet are sharply higher as the company resumes trading after generating about $93 million from the institutional stage of its capital raising.

Webjet shares were trading at $12.31, at 1030 AEST, up 12.5 per cent on their price when they entered a two-day trading halt for the first phase of the entitlement offer.

The company says it has had a 98 per cent take-up rate for the $10 per new share institutional capital raising segment, with the retail component set to open on August 10.

Webjet plans to raise about $164 million in total to support its acquisition of European travel business JacTravel Group.

Chairman Roger Sharp says acquiring JacTravel, a business-to-business operation, will support Webjet's aim to become a more globally diversified travel player.
