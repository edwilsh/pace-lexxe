  <title>Plants grown around grave create eerie 'ghost dog' optical illusion</title>
  <content>
An uncanny optical illusion of a "ghost dog" in a pet cemetery gave one cyclist ample reason for a double take on their ride.
In a video uploaded to YouTube yesterday, the cyclist approached a grave which appeared to be surmounted by the wavering image of a standing dog.
On closer inspection, it is revealed that by a trick of perspective, the flowers around the grave had merged to create the startling shape.
The gravestone, in the US state of Maine, is dedicated to "Kosmo", who lived from January 2, 1999 to January 17, 2017.
"Best pup dog in the whole wide world" the inscription reads - right next to a relief that bears an eerie resemblance to the illusory "ghost dog" created by the flowers.
"RIP Kosmo. I never knew you but you made my day a little more interesting," the cyclist wrote.
He pledged that any advertising revenue from the video would be donated to a local shelter in Kosmo's name.
