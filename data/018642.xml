Harry Styles reveals gruelling filming conditions for Dunkirk

WHETHER their greatest love is Zayn, Harry, Niall, Liam or Louis, Directioners are not a fickle lot.

Not since the Spice Girls have the solo fortunes of a boy band or girl group been so buoyant.

As the first member of the X Factor-generated One Direction to jump ship in 2015, Zayn Malik enjoyed the full force of the unwavering support of their passionate fanbase when he launched his musical independence in March last year.

His edgy r&b solo style was universally embraced by the Directioners and critics alike, with the debut single Pillowtalk debuting at No. 1 in the major markets including US, UK and Australia.

The music video helped push the single to peak virality thanks to the steamy scenes featuring Malik's supermodel girlfriend Gigi Hadid.

Its success perfectly set up the release of his Mind Of Mine album, released a year to the week he quit the boy band, to repeat its chart-topping feat and smash streaming records.

Mind Of Mine reached one billion plays on Spotify in June this year, which is remarkable considering he hasn't issued a new single from the record since June in 2016.

But as his former bandmates entered the solo playing field with the announcement of their "hiatus" in August 2015, Malik kept his pop culture currency not only by virtue of his relationship with Hadid but his collaboration with her bestie Taylor Swift on I Don't Wanna Live Forever for the soundtrack of Fifty Shades Darker.

As 1D's fashion maverick, he has joined the ranks of the celebrity designers, partnering with Donatella Versace to be the creative director of a capsule line called Zayn x Versus.

While there were tensions between the first dissenter and his bandmates - much to the sadness of the Directioners - it appears the cold war has melted with Louis Tomlinson telling Siruis radio this week "So we're mates again, I suppose."

"We got back in touch with each other and kind of cleared the air and talked everything through," the 25-year-old singer said.

Niall Horan was the next to dip his toe in the deep end of the pop pool with his debut single This Town, released in September last year, signalling his desire to continue as 1D's acoustic troubadour.

The stripped-back affair also ignited the built-in fanbase and soared to the top of the charts and has had almost 190 million Spotify plays since then.

But its success has been outshone by the next single, a song which instantly provoked comparisons with Ed Sheeran, which was completely spot-on because the British superstar and One Direction mate co-wrote it. And Sheeran kept him from No. 1 on the ARIA charts with this year's unbeatable hit Shape Of You.

Horan has been in competition at the top of the charts in recent weeks with Liam Payne's debut solo single, which features American rapper Quavo, the go-to guest for chart success this year.

The Capitol Records labelmates have been neck and neck on the Australian airplay charts (Payne was No. 1 and Horan No. 2) but the next test will be their respective albums with both artists expected to release records before the end of the year.

Joining them in the crowded singles market last month was Tomlinson with his first single as lead artist Back To You featuring Bebe Rexha and Digital Farm Animals, which was the most added track to radio playlists last week. Within two weeks it had clocked over 25 million plays on Spotify.

Tomlinson looked to be taking a decidedly different solo lane with his first musical effort post hiatus, linking with celebrity DJ Steve Aoki for Just Hold On.

As the single was released, Tomlinson's mother Johannah died after a year-long battle with leukaemia, with the singerwith his plans to perform it on X Factor that week.

But there is little doubt that the One Direction member to generate the most fascination among fans and the entertainment industry is .

Girlfriend-spotting aside, Styles is the guy everyone has watched.

His debut single Sign Of the Times, an epic throwback to '70s rock that recalled everyone from Elton John to Queen and has had a whopping 206 million streams on Spotify since its release in April.

The self-titled debut album matched Malik for No. 1s in the major territories but where he is leading the One Direction pack is at the box office. Both for concerts and films.

Earning comparisons to the career trajectory of Justin Timberlake, Styles is the only member of the quintet to score a major feature film role, receiving plenty of praise for his acting chops in the Christopher Nolan box office hit Dunkirk.

His theatre tour which kicks off in the US in September and will feature two shows in Australia in November sold out in mere minutes.

Fans who missed out might consider securing a spot near the ARIA Awards red carpet that month with Styles expected to be one of the international guests to attend the event.

Styles quickly took advantage of fan demand to announce he would upgrade to arenas for a national tour of Australia next April.

Horan is also venturing back on to the stage with his "intimate" Flicker Sessions theatre tour also posting sold-out signs around the globe, including one show only in Australia at Sydney's Enmore Theatre on July 10.
