  <title>Premier won't guarantee trains for Games</title>
  <content>
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has refused to confirm if expected train services will be running for the upcoming Commonwealth Games, with one of her MPs predicting a "transport debacle".
The state government is struggling to have transport ready in time for April's Games, Maryborough MP Bruce Saunders told Triple M on Monday, and Ms Palaszczuk would only say on Tuesday she was "very optimistic that we will have the extra trains that are needed in time for the Commonwealth Games".
While "hopeful", Ms Palaszczuk has sought to distance herself from the issue, saying the contracts for new trains, built in India, were signed by the former government and no more trains would arrive until problems with those already in Queensland were resolved.
