Police have confirmed a body found in a submerged car in central Queensland belongs to missing resident Leslie Schulze.
The 69-year-old's vehicle was pulled from eight metres of water at Toolooa Bends in South Gladstone last Wednesday night, three hours after it was discovered by divers.
On Tuesday, detectives confirmed the body was that of Mr Schulze. They say his death is being treated as not suspicious.
