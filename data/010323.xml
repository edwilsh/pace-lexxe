  <title>Canberra Now: SES pay rise, and a solution to Braddon's parking woes?</title>
  <content>
Good morning Canberra,
We're on the homeward stretch now. We can expect rain in the afternoon and evening and a maximum temperature of 12 degrees. The plus side? Less frost. Enjoy the extra five minutes of sleep.
Let's take a look at what's making headlines today.
Millions on ACT Health repairs

The bill to rectify "extreme and high risks" linked to ageing Canberra Hospital infrastructure was put at more than $40 million in an audit last year.
The ACT Health asset condition assessment report found the total cost of infrastructure repairs and replacement at the hospital alone came to $131.1 million - funds expected to be spent over a decade from last year.

But the vast majority of the 600-odd issues highlighted across 31 ACT Health properties were low or medium risks, ranging from broken handrails and poorly maintained carpets to more serious electrical supply systems.

The ACT government has doubled down on its refusal to help a young dog attack victim with his health bills.
Canberra Liberal Steve Doszpot made the application on behalf of 13-year-old Jack Hartigan, who was savaged by dogs seven years ago, and his parents Patrick and Joanna in the Legislative Assembly yesterday.
Chief Minister Andrew Barr thanked Mr Doszpot said the Hartigans' claim did not meet the strict set of criteria needed to approve an ex gratia payment.
The family wants $200,000 (you can contribute ).

Immigration bosses enjoy pay rise

What's the bet there's some crabby workers in Immigration today?
Department bosses will get a second pay rise inside eight months while a freeze on salary growth remains for rank-and-file workers locked in a marathon bargaining dispute.
Department of Immigration and Border Protection secretary Mike Pezzullo handed staff in the top-level senior executive service band an immediate 2 per cent increase to their pay, on top of another 2 per cent rise in November last year - and the CPSU isn't happy.

A proposal to fix parking issues in Braddon? Sign me up.
Proposals from local group Braddon Precinct include a plan to swap one lane of Lonsdale Street for angled street parking, which could create between 150 to 200 additional parks.
The proposal would keep the existing trees in the centre of the street, and include pedestrian crossings and more loading zones for retailers. Existing access points for residential buildings and businesses would remain in place.
