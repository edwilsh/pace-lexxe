  <title>Alan Tongue clone the key for Ipswich State High</title>
  <content>
RUGBY LEAGUE: He can, and has, played just about everywhere on the rugby league field for Ipswich State High.
Now versatile lock forward Trent Manihera- Paul has a big role to play in the south-east Queensland quarter final of the GIO Cup against Marsden High at Wynnum today.
Manihera-Paul has been likened by coach Lee Addison to Raiders legend Alan Tongue.
The coach said he has extra responsibility against the mobile and enthusiastic Marsden outfit.
"Trent, my lock, is the one who mops things up for me and always has a high tackle count," Addison said.
"He is going to be a busy boy in this game mopping up in the middle.
"I'd compare him to Alan Tongue at Canberra back in the day, a player who you could put anywhere on the field.
"For the two years Trent has been in first grade he's been right centre, right second-row, left centre, lock and prop.
"Sometimes we have played with three props to get some ascendancy in the middle and he will play the role of a prop.
"At other times he'll be asked to pop up anywhere on the field. He's a quite old-fashioned lock in that sense."
Ipswich State High have qualified automatically as members of the Super Six competition.
Addison said Ipswich High's opponents were a quality outfit and well coached.
"There seems to be a rivalry with everyone we play now," Addison said.
"Everyone is always ready for a tough game against us because we always aim up.
"Marsden are very mobile in the middle and very energetic and enthusiastic. They definitely play for their coach, Joe O'Callaghan, who coached the Northern Pride last year.
"Joe has done a great job with them this year and when we played them in round four of the Super Six it was a top of the table clash at the time."
Ipswich High won that game and finished second overall in the Langer Trophy.
Addison's lads will have to be on song today.
"Our kick-chase game will have to be very good because they have a great fullback,'' the coach said.
"Our left and right edge will have to be switched on and the kicking game of Bernetti Graf and Joel Hughes will need to be on point."
