  <title>Soprano's love affair with Townsville</title>
  <content>
MUSICIANS are stereotyped.
Trumpet and trombone players are forever referred to as "earthy" and "boozy".
Sopranos are branded as divas.
Soprano Natalie Peluso, who wowed festival audiences in Bach's Cantata 32 BMW and Strauss's Four Last Songs, says: "I reserve feisty behaviour for the stage."
"I'm down to earth off it. Keeping yourself grounded is how you stay sane in a tough business," she says.
If the diva label is a myth, it seems singers have to be shape-shifters flitting between diverse performances.
Days before her appearance at the Australian Festival of Chamber Music, Peluso starred as the demure Rosebud in Opera Queensland's hit production of Ruddigore.
When the festival winds up, she takes on not one but two roles, Ottavia, a scorned Empress, and Drusilla, a love-sick conspirator, in Pinchgut Opera's The Coronation of Poppea.
"It could be the first time these roles have been sung by one singer since the original production 450 years ago. Both parts are hugely different dramatically and vocally," she says.
One of an operatic soprano's perks is travelling to spectacular places.
"It's magic to sing in fancy opera houses like Royal Covent Garden," she says.
"But my best memories are of the odd stages like when I sang Carmina Burana in Pendennis Castle, an old Cornish artillery fortress overlooking the sea."
Peluso loves Townsville, the "sensational" weather and the joy of working with world-class musicians.
"And the volunteers ferrying us from hotel to rehearsal to theatre and back are just incredible," she says.
