  <title>NSW police officer knocked over by ute</title>
  <content>
A man is under police guard in hospital after he allegedly knocked down an officer with a ute on Sydney's north shore.
Officers were called to a property in Naremburn late on Tuesday night following reports of a trespasser.
Police say they were trying to talk to the man when he drove off, knocking one of the officers to the ground.
The driver and the policeman were taken to the Royal North Shore hospital with minor injuries and the driver is expected to be charged after his release.
