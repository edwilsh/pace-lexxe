  <title>Manus death sparks concerns for refugees</title>
  <content>
The death of a refugee on Manus Island has sparked calls for Australian authorities to intervene after what advocates have described as a preventable tragedy.
The immigration department says it is aware of the man's death, which is being investigated by PNG authorities.
The man is understood to have taken his own life in the township of Lorengau before he was due to move from detention into the Papua New Guinean community.
"More deaths are likely unless the Australian government acts immediately to bring these people, on both Manus Island and Nauru, to safety in Australia," David Berger of Doctors for Refugees said on Monday.
The Turnbull government has consistently said refugees being held in offshore detention will never settle in Australia.
Tensions are high on Manus Island, with water and electricity cut off to some compounds at the regional processing centre as authorities try to shuffle detainees around ahead of its October closure.
Adding to this is the release of a leaked transcript of Malcolm Turnbull and Donald Trump discussing a people-swap deal in January.
The prime minister assured the new president the United States was not obliged to accept a single refugee, needing only to process those held in detention to honour the bargain.
Mr Turnbull admitted Australia would rather take some of America's most "unattractive guys" than a Nobel Peace Prize winner who came by boat.
The dead man is understood to be an Iranian refugee with a history of mental illness.
"He was very sick for (a) long time but Australia did not provide medical treatment for him," Iranian journalist and Manus Island refugee Behrouz Boochani posted to Twitter.
Daniel Webb, from the Human Rights Law Centre, said the man deserved a chance to build a life in freedom and safety when he sought asylum.
Instead, he was held in a "dangerous, unsafe and painful" limbo.
"This man lost his freedom, and then he lost his hope, and now he's lost his life - it is an absolute tragedy," Mr Webb told reporters in Melbourne.
Greens immigration spokesman Nick McKim laid blame for the man's death at the feet of Immigration Minister Peter Dutton.
"This man repeatedly sought Australia's help. The Liberals ignored his pleas and now must bear responsibility for what happened," Senator McKim said.
Amnesty International is concerned he was provided inadequate health care and his safety was not paramount.
"There must be an independent, impartial, prompt and effective investigation into his death," spokesman Graham Thom said.
The refugee is the fifth man held on Manus, and the seventh in total, who has died since Australia's offshore detention regime began in 2013.
