  <title>Slippery conditions across the state</title>
  <content>
ICE is making driving tricky on roads across Tasmania after very cold temperatures overnight.
There have been reports of ice on the road on the Lyell Highway between Queenstown and Derwent Bridge and on the Murchison Highway, particularly around Tullah and Mt Black.
The Bureau of Meterorology issued a road weather alert for many parts of the state from the North-West Coast through to the Central Plateau, upper Derwent Valley and the East Coast.
The temperature plunged down to an eye-watering -9.1C at 7am this morning in Liawenee in Tasmania's Central Highlands.

It was also very chilly in Cressy, with a morning temperature of -3.7C, and in Ross, with -2.3C.
It was positively balmy atop Mt Wellington by comparison, with a morning low of -0.3C.
Conditions will continue to be cold across the state, with snow forecast for Tasmania's interior from Saturday through to Tuesday after rain tomorrow.

It will snow at Cradle Mountain on Sunday and Monday and Mt Field is expecting a good dusting from Saturday through to Wednesday next week.
