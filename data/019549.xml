Kindertransport
Eternity Playhouse, August 4.
Until August 20
★★★
 
Like the stage adaptation of Anne Frank's diary, Diane Samuels' play Kindertransport views the Holocaust through the eyes of a child. Unlike that of Anne Frank, its story extends beyond the Nazi era and into the present.Photo: Supplied
Samuels' title refers to the plan hatched in 1938 to evacuate Jewish children from Germany and Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe. The outbreak of war would put an end to the program but in just over a year, nearly 10,000 children and teenagers were spirited away with many heading for England.
Without doubt, being a kindertransportee was a lifesaver. But it was also a profound life-changer for those who made the journey, especially for the many who never went home.
Samuels splits her play between the attic of a suburban English house, circa 1989, and scenes 50 years prior. The link between the settings is a box of yellowing letters and old photographs found in an old trunk by Faith (played by Harriet Gordon-Anderson), the uni student daughter of Evelyn (Camilla Ah Kin). Her discovery turns an already tense relationship into one charged with anger and denial.
At the same time this drama is unfolding, Samuels also follows the progress of 10-year-old German-Jewish refugee Eva (Sarah Greenwood) as she makes her way from Hamburg in 1939 to Manchester, England, where she's taken in by the warm-hearted Lil (Annie Byron).

As Eva assimilates and distances herself from the calamity that overtakes her family back home, Samuels explores what it is to repress memories and deny one's identity. What, she asks, does that means for generations to come?
As a play, Kindertransport is solidly made, purposeful stuff and suitable for all but the very young. Adults in the audience might find it a little too measured and contained in its emotional range, however. But while you might wish for something a little more fiery at times, Samuels' craft and palpable respect for her subjects and her thesis is enough to sustain interest.
That care is reflected in director Sandra Eldridge's handsome production. Designer Imogen Ross's art installation-like backdrop of hundreds of cardboard boxes looks great, lights beautifully (Matt Cox takes care of that) and suggests impermanence while echoing those enormous warehouses of possessions stripped from concentration camp internees. Jed Silver's cinematic sound design is excellent.
The acting, too, is detailed and convincing, particularly from Ah Kin, Gordon-Anderson and Byron. Their understated performances earn our sympathy rather than demand it.
Greenwood (who makes her Sydney debut in this show) is a bright, likeable presence and there's solid support from Emma Palmer as Eva's mother, and from Christopher Tomkinson who portrays a number of uniformed characters and, through shadow play brings to spooky life the grasping hands of the Ratcatcher, the fairytale character who rounded up all the children of Hamlin and led them away, never to return.
