  <title>Fewer airport delays for travellers: PM</title>
  <content>
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull expects there will be fewer delays at Australian airports for travellers after authorities disrupted an aviation terror threat.
ASIO has moved to restore the aviation threat level to what it was before the alleged plot to bring down a plane was uncovered.
Mr Turnbull on Thursday said enhanced security measures will continue at airports but will be modified to reduce delays.
