  <title>Volunteering in his blood</title>
  <content>
RAY Thurlow's first flirtation with St John Ambulance was during World Expo '88 when he volunteered for 500 hours over six months at the Brisbane-defining event.
Then he joined the Queensland Ambulance Service but returned to volunteer with the charity in 2000 because it needed a paramedic to open a Wynnum division.
"They said sign up and we'll give you a uniform, that's all we need from you," he said.
Mr Thurlow has held management roles at St John and helped at countless Ekkas, major sporting events and supported Queenslanders through natural disasters like Cyclone Yasi.
His dedicated service in the past 18 years was recognised last month when he was accepted as a member into the Order of St John, second only to the Order of Australia.
"It feels pretty tickled pink when you're acknowledged," he said.
"It's not all bandaid stuff, it's more than that ... (it's) being there to provide the hands-on first aid but also a listening ear and a hand on the shoulder.
"Whether it's with St John, or anywhere, volunteering is the heart and soul of the community."
Mr Thurlow was not one to big-note himself and was dobbed into the Wynnum Herald by a colleague from his work at Alphapharm, Wacol.
St John Ambulance Australia Queensland chief executive officer said the organisation was "very grateful" to have volunteers like Mr Thurlow.
