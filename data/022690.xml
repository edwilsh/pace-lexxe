  <title>Paul Tully tops polling ahead of Ipswich mayoral vote</title>
  <content>
Acting Ipswich mayor Paul Tully, who for years  served as deputy to embattled former mayor Paul Pisasale, has topped the first major poll held in the city ahead of the August 19 byelection.

The results showed that the scandals surrounding Mr Pisasale, , has not rubbed off on his former council colleagues, with more than half of respondents seemingly happy to have a sitting councillor take the mayoralty.
Policy announcements and preference arrangements will influence the final outcome.
The byelection, brought about by Mr Pisasale's resignation in June, will be an optional preferential poll.
The poll was conducted by Ipswich branch of the Queensland Community Alliance, which has solidified from a number of church and union organisations in Ipswich, Logan and Brisbane over the past two years.

The alliance is asking for a "new culture of working" for Ipswich in the post-Pisasale era.

Queensland Community Alliance Ipswich representative David Copeman said the ReachTEL poll was commissioned to determine who the public believed were the top contenders for mayor.
"We just didn't know who that was," Mr Copeman said.
The top four contenders were subsequently invited to a pre-election assembly at Ipswich City Uniting Church on Sunday, where the results were revealed.
Mr Klass could not attend because of football commitments.
Mr Copeman said the Queensland Community Alliance was genuinely seeking a "new culture" for Ipswich.
Cr Tully, Cr Antoniolli, Mr Duffy and Mr Robinson all came to the Sunday alliance meeting, where they were asked to support four community issues.
There were asked to run "an open council", to support plans to buy and run a 40-hectare farm outside Rosewood where new migrants can work and to explore new mental health schemes.
The refugee farm is known as the "OkieDokie refugee farmshare project" and is a model taken from the United States where groups of refugee farmers collectively "farm" in one hectare blocks.
Mr Copeman said a farm has been identified in the Rosewood area and negotiations were underway to acquire it.
All four mayor candidates agreed on Sunday to back the four initiatives out forward by the Queensland Community Alliance.
Mr Copeman said Cr Tully told those at the Sunday assembly he would "pledge free water for the farm project."
Lloyd Abbot, a Together Union organiser and co-chairman of the Queensland Community Alliance, said Cr Tully promised to sign a formal memorandum of understanding with the Queensland Community Alliance.
"Today we showed the candidates that the power lies with us - the people," Mr Abbott said.
"We'll work with whoever is elected, but having the promise from each of them, in public and on record, means whoever the next mayor is, they've promised to bring a new culture of working with the community to the mayoralty".
Cr Tully could not be immediately contacted on Monday morning for comment or confirmation of these points.
