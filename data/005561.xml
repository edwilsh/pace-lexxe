Nicole Kidman's pledge to female directors

The 'Queen of Cannes' Nicole Kidman talks to Stephanie Bunbury about The Killing of a Sacred Deer, her early acting life and her support of female directors.

"I just never get offered comedy but I would love to do it, but I think I'm funny in this," Kidman said at the premiere of the BBC drama series.
"In my next film [The Upside] I got to use my own accent again, something I want to do more of. I said, 'I think she'd be better as an Australian' and Kevin Hart and Bryan Cranston looked at me weirdly, as the role was written as an American, but Harvey Weinstein [producer and film studio boss] said, 'Yep, she's Australian'," Kidman said.Photo: AAP Image/Paul Miller
Top of the Lake: China Girl is Kidman's latest turn to television, a medium she loves and one that loves her right back thanks to her starring role in HBO's sleeper hit, Big Little Lies earlier this year. 
While a second series of Big Little Lies - a project she starred in and co-produced - has been green lit, Kidman is keen to work back in Australia.  

"I would like to. I love being here and being apart of this industry. I love being able to use my own accent," she said.

"I got off the plane and I came to rehearsal and I just felt so at ease and relaxed and at home. We have good food, good conversation, then we rehearsed and played rigorously," Kidman said of her experiences filming Top of the Lake: China Girl in Sydney over summer. 
Top of the Lake: China Girl and Big Little Lies have one common thread; strong female narratives, but that's just coincidence for Kidman, who says it's not gender but what's behind-the-scenes that inspire her.
"I'm drawn to great directors and really bold characters, that's what I'm interested in," she said. "I like dialogue that is spicy and interesting and honest."
Kidman, alongside co-stars Elizabeth Moss and Gwendoline Christie, shines on the small screen in Top of the Lake: China Girl.
She plays an infuriatingly protective adoptive mother to a head strong 17-year-old, played by Campion's real-life daughter Alice Englert.
