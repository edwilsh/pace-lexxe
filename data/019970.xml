  <title>Knight hero's broken back</title>
  <content>
NEWCASTLE fullback Nathan Ross has been diagnosed with a fractured back following the Knight's NRL win over the Warriors on Saturday.
The Knights' first back-to-back victory in almost two years came at a heavy cost with the fan favourite (pictured) going down with what appears to be a serious injury.
Ross was hospitalised and taken for scans after copping an accidental knee from Blake Ayshford with the club giving no timeline for his recovery.
"He was taken to hospital for scans, which confirmed a fracture of the L1 transverse process," the club said in a statement.
"Ross' injury will not require surgery."
Ross has been one of the club's best performers this year and his absence will leave the Knights with a gaping hole to fill with four games remaining.
Peter Mata'utia filled in at fullback during the second half against the Warriors, while Dane Gagai has also played on occasions in the No.1 jumper over the last three seasons.
