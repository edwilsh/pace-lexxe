  <title>Delays in Colosimo drug charge court case</title>
  <content>
Australian actor Vince Colosimo wasn't in court to hear a Melbourne magistrate's frustration over delays in his drug-driving case.
Colosimo, 50, is charged with driving with drugs in his system and being behind the wheel while suspended after being stopped by police recently.
The Underbelly actor's matter was mentioned by the Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Thursday but Colosimo was not required to appear in person and was interstate.
