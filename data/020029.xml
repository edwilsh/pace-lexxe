A fourth Sydney man accused of involvement in a plot to bomb a plane destined for the Middle East has been charged with a non-terror related offence.

The 39-year-old was arrested last Saturday alongside three other men, two of whom were later charged with preparing for or planning a terrorist act while the other was released without charge.

The fourth man was on Sunday bailed to appear in Downing Centre Local Court on August 24 charged with possessing a prohibited weapon.
