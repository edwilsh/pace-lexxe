  <title>Aussies dealt massive tour blow</title>
  <content>
AUSTRALIAN quick James Pattinson has had his Test return delayed again after being ruled out of the upcoming tour of Bangladesh.
Pattinson, who enjoyed a stunning stint in county cricket recently, reported soreness in his back while training in Brisbane last week.
Scans revealed inflammation around the area where he had previously had a stress fracture and Cricket Australia medical staff opted to rule him out of the two-Test series which begins at the end of this month.
It is at this stage only a precaution, but Pattinson won't be back to full training until at least September, and he is expected to be available for the Ashes.
Pattinson hasn't played Test cricket since breaking down in New Zealand in February 2016.
Jackson Bird will take Pattinson's place in the squad, with fellow quick Mitch Starc also sidelined by injury.
Selectors this morning confirmed the call-up of leg-spinner Mitchell Swepson for the tour.
Australia's now employed players will assemble for a pre-tour camp in Darwin next week.
