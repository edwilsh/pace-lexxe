  <title>Man charged over 1997 murder seeks bail</title>
  <content>
A man recently charged with the 1997 murder of his Gold Coast business partner is seeking to be released from custody.
Neil Pentland, 68, was arrested in June following a reignited investigation into the execution-style killing of Philip Carlyle.
Mr Carlyle, 47, was found in an air-conditioning plant room at his Robina business in April 1997 with four gunshot wounds to the head.
Mechanic John Hitchen was released on bail in June shortly after being charged as an accessory after the fact to Mr Carlyle's murder.
Pentland's wife Dianne Margaret Pentland is also on bail, charged with making a misleading or false statement.
Pentland is due to face a bail hearing in the Brisbane Supreme Court on Friday.
