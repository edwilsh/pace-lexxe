  <title>Shrine of Remembrance hosts exhibition on R.A.N role on the Pacific War</title>
  <content>
The role played by the Royal Australian Navy in the War in the Pacific is being commemorated at Melbourne's Shrine of Remembrance at the moment.
A special exhibition called Nerves and Steel: The Royal Australian Navy in the Pacific 1941- 45 was launched by Rear Admiral Guy Griffiths.
Features of the exhibition include paintings on loan from the Australian War Memorial, and original memorabilia from the Shrine collection and living Second World War veterans.
Admiral Griffiths served in the Pacific right through the war as a junior officer, and was one of the survivors from the battlecruiser HMS Repulse when it was sunk by Japanese planes in 1941 alongside its partner battleship HMS Prince of Wales north of Singapore.
He tells Bruce Hill the Royal Australian Navy played a proud role on the war, and it is still making a significant contribution to peace on the region.
