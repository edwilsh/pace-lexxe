An encampment of homeless people in Martin Place will be moved on as early as  Tuesday morning after the City of Sydney Lord Mayor, Clover Moore, announced a plan to dismantle the camp. 
Ms Moore told a press conference on Monday that "safe spaces" would be created in inner-city areas including Redfern where those currently living in tents would be relocated.

Tent city inappropriate: Berejiklian

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian calls on Sydney mayor Clover Moore to use her powers to move on the large group of tents in Martin Place.

Ms Moore said the City would contribute $100,000, and she expected the Department of Family and Community Services to also contribute $100,000 for the plan.

She described the safe spaces as "immediate and temporary" for those relocating from Martin Place. 
She said "a final agreement hasn't been reached" with the state government when it comes to a long-term housing solution. 

The so-called mayor of tent city Lanz Priestley also agreed to the move, and will be ready when the first moving truck arrives on Tuesday morning.

Ms Moore's press conference came ahead of much-anticipated City of Sydney council meeting, at which she was expected to debate the issue. 
Earlier on Monday, the Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, urged the City of Sydney to "do the right thing" and resolve the issue. 
Ms Berejiklian said that if the City didn't use their existing powers, then the state government would be forced to step in.
