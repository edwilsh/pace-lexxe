  <title>Nick Kyrgios injures shoulder in US Open lead-up event in Washington</title>
  <content>
Nick Kyrgios' injury troubles have continued beyond Wimbledon after he was forced to retire from the Washington ATP event because of a shoulder complaint less than four weeks out from the US Open.
Kyrgios was trailing 3-6, 0-3 to the world number 106 Tennys Sandgren at one of the key US Open warm-up events when he pulled the pin after being in obvious discomfort throughout the match.
It was Kyrgios' first tournament since .
Kyrgios had ignored the advice of doctors to miss Wimbledon because of the injury but his campaign finished soon after it began, when he forced out of his first-round match while down two sets to love against Pierre-Hugues Herbert.
, as any procedure would have almost certainly ruled the 22-year-old out of the US Open, as well as Australia's Davis Cup semi-final away to Belgium.
"I would do everything possible to avoid it," Kyrgios said following his Wimbledon exit.
"But I don't know. I'm obviously a little bit scared. But I don't think I need it at the moment. Hopefully get an injection or something, do rehab, and get healthy.
"I can't really do anything. It's just a bit unlucky what happened."
Kyrgios had reached the second round in Washington after a bye in the opening round.
Meanwhile, Kyrgios' fellow Australian Jordan Thompson came frustratingly close to upsetting world number eight Alexander Zverev in the second round.
The 23-year-old Thompson lost 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), having led the third-set tiebreak 5-4 before conceding the final three points of the match.
Earlier, Australian Marc Polmans lost his second-round match to American Jared Donaldson in straight sets.
The 20-year-old Polmans was beaten 6-2, 6-3 by the world number 69 Donaldson.
