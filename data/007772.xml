  <title>Woman bashed after answering front door</title>
  <content>
TWO women have allegedly bashed another female after she opened the front door of her Brompton home overnight.
Just after 11.30pm, a woman answered her door and was assaulted by two women known to her.
The suspects then forced their way into the house and bashed the victim again, leaving her with minor injuries, before fleeing on foot.
Police arrived shortly after and found the two women in a hotel carpark on Port Road.
A 24-year-old Hawthorn woman and a 20-year-old Crystal Brook woman were arrested and charged with aggravated serious criminal trespass and aggravated assault.
Officers also allegedly found the women to be in possession of a substance, believed to be ice, and an ice pipe.
They were further charged with possessing a controlled substance and equipment and will appear in the Port Adelaide Magistrates Court at a later date.
