  <title>Interesting ways to earn interest</title>
  <content>
IT'S NEVER too early to start investing.
In fact the earlier you start the more you can make out of compound interest paid on both the principal and also on any interest from past years.
Often it's used when someone reinvests any interest they gained back into the original investment.
For example if I receive 5% interest on my $1000 investment the first year and I reinvest that money back into the original investment, in the second year I would receive 5% interest on $1000 and the $50 I reinvested.
Over time compound interest will make much more money than simple interest but the key is finding where to invest.
While there are multiple different investment types and asset classes available, there are some fundamental principles to make long term successful choices.
Particularly when financial markets become volatile.
History tells us downturns may be followed by upswings so best not to make hasty decisions during times of volatility.
Compound interest and regular investments of small amounts can make a significant difference over 20-year plus time frames.
Buy low and sell high, as starting point valuations matter.
Focus on investments providing decent and sustainable cash flows, dividends and distributions as they may be a good buffer in volatile times.
Invest for the long term but for those with a short term horizon, think about what type of returns or cash flow you need to both protect your savings and keep ahead of inflation.
