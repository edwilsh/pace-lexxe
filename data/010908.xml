  <title>19 photos of North Korea's 'Hotel of Doom'</title>
  <content>
Much confusion and mystery surrounds the 105-story, pyramid-shaped Ryugyong Hotel, also known as the "Hotel of Doom," in North Korea.

Last week, Pyongyang took walls surrounding the building down, unveiling walkways to the hotel, fuelling speculation that construction might start again,  to Fox News.

Construction on the hotel began in 1987, under Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea and Kim Jong Un's grandfather. It was supposed to be  in the late 1980s, but construction was stopped short in the early 1990s because of an economic depression.

An Egyptian company was hired to make some improvements in 2008, and there have been rumours in the last few years that it could open soon, but the hotel's fate remains unknown.

Below are photos of the hotel, most of which were taken in Spring 2017 and provided by Korea Risk Group, a company billed as the leading provider of risk analysis, news, information and data surrounding North Korea.
