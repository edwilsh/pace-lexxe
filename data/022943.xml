  <title>NSW bus driver charged over acid attacks</title>
  <content>
A Sydney bus driver is accused of pouring an acid-like substance on at least 16 cars at Macquarie University and a nearby shopping centre.
The 53-year-old was arrested early on Friday after police received reports from victims whose cars were targeted between February and June.
Initially, police had only three confirmed cases until users on a Chinese-language forum speculated the attacks were racially motivated and formed a group to encourage more victims to come forward.
Vehicles at carparks in Macquarie University and Macquarie Park shopping centre were damaged over a four-month period.
Superintendent Stephen Egginton said the man was identified with the help of photographs taken by a victim.
"We were able to identify the offender as being a bus driver and that linked into the times of the offences across the areas where they occurred," he told reporters in Sydney on Monday.
"It's important members of the community feel they can report these matters to us, because the early indications were that there was a reluctance from some ... to come forward."
Supt Egginton said the "acid-like" substance was yet to be tested and detectives were considering all potential motives, including whether the attacks were racially motivated.
Detectives are also working to put together a potential damage bill from the crimes before the man appears in Burwood Local Court on August 21.
He was granted bail and faces 16 counts of malicious damage, however that number is likely to rise if more victims come forward.
Supt Egginton said police would allege the bus driver was working a route across Sydney's northwest when the "brazen" offences were committed.
