An investigation is underway after a man turned up at a Sydney hospital with a gunshot wound to the leg.
The 20-year-old man arrived at Campbelltown Hospital about 11.30pm on Sunday and was treated for his injury, which wasn't life threatening.
NSW Police were told the shooting occurred in Mary Wade Reserve at Woodbine, but no evidence has been found and they are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.
