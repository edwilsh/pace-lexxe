  <title>Why Cats decided against Danger appeal</title>
  <content>
PATRICK Dangerfield cannot win the 2017 Brownlow Medal after Geelong decided against rolling the dice on an appeal of his suspension for a dangerous tackle.
The superstar midfielder will miss the Cats' clash against Sydney on Friday night.
Under the Brownlow rules he is now ineligible to win the game's top individual award,.
Dangerfield was offered a one-match ban by the match review panel on Monday for rough conduct on Carlton's Matthew Kreuzer.
The Cats would have risked losing Dangerfield for a second game if they appealed the decision at the tribunal and failed.
"After seeking independent advice, the club has decided to accept the penalty handed down to Pat by the match review panel," Geelong's football manager Steve Hocking said.
"The club reviewed all possibilities around the case in coming to this decision. We respect the fact that the match review panel has a challenging and difficult role and has to operate under high scrutiny.
"While there has been a lot of debate around Pat's eligibility for the Brownlow Medal, Pat and the club have at all times remained focussed on what is best for the team as we head towards to last part of the season."
Dangerfield's tackle on Kreuzer left the Carlton ruckman concussed and was rated of medium impact to the head.

MRP member Jimmy Bartel said Dangerfield's conduct was careless. "That was probably the discussion the MRP had yesterday; was it a careless act and unreasonable?" Bartel told radio station RSN927 on Tuesday. "As soon as they decided, well, maybe Danger had a duty of care and could have done a little bit better, then it comes onto the table.
"I think we all agreed, it wasn't intentional. It was a careless act."

My understanding is Geeling won't appeal Patty Dangerfield's one week ban. Too much to lose. Rest helps heal his ankle, team over Charlie

The MRP's assessment has been hotly debated and Cats coach Chris Scott admitted his initial thought was to go in to bat for his superstar.
But he said the price of a two-match ban was a huge risk.
"That's our instinct but we do have a duty to the team," Scott said. "We've got big games coming up towards the end of the season ... we play two teams in contention for the top four."
Second-placed Geelong have two massive home games, against the resurgent Swans (sixth) and against Richmond (fourth) the week after.
Dangerfield, who has enjoyed another stellar season, said he wasn't worried about missing out on a possible second Brownlow.
"We'll make a decision that's best for the team, not the individual, and what's best for the rest of our season," Dangerfield told reporters on Monday evening.
"(The Brownlow Medal) is the last thing on my mind."
