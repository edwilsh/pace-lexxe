Not-for-profit business group Sports Gold Coast has orchestrated the move, brought about by the merger of Gold Coast Athletic and Gold Coast Galaxy, two new franchises who were to join the new second-tier Queensland Premier League next year.
The merged entity have instead convinced Football Queensland to take back those licences and issue Gold Coast United with a single ticket into the men's and women's NPL competitions for 2018.
All local clubs on the Gold Coast have automatic membership in the new entity, which will be pitched as a community-focused, grassroots club that will aim to keep player registration costs as low as possible.
The long-term goal is re-entry into the A-League as an expansion outfit.

It comes five years on from the demise of the Clive Palmer-owned Gold Coast United, which suffered from abysmal crowds and was closed down by Football Federation Australia after three A-League seasons.
"It's a once in a football generation opportunity," Gold Coast United chairman Danny Maher, a tech entrepreneur and the founder of Opmantek, said.

"We are proud to bring United back in a community-driven model and unite the sport on the Gold Coast.
"United we can achieve amazing things.
"In the next few months we will roll out our plans and key announcements making United a serious force in Australian football."
Maher said the club had permission to use Gold Coast United's intellectual property after discussions with FFA boss David Gallop, but would let supporters determine what logo and playing strip the team would wear.
