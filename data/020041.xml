  <title>Sharks back from brink and firing ahead of finals</title>
  <content>
RUGBY LEAGUE: Coach Glenn Irwin admits he had given up on his team six weeks ago but now he's relishing the prospect of finals footy.
Caloundra is third on the six-team Sunshine Coast division one ladder through 18 of 19 rounds after dropping just one of its past five games.
A 52-14 thrashing of Nambour at Shark Park on Saturday enhanced the team's claims and confirmed it will host the minor-semi-final in the four-team play-offs.
The team's form is a far cry from its mid-season woes, when it lost five in a row.
"Six weeks ago I didn't think we'd win another game. We were terrible," Irwin said.
"You could've dropped us back to reserve grade and we wouldn't have a game there.
"But we've won a couple in a row now ... we've got a bit of a spring in our step."
Irwin was unsure what caused the turnaround.
"We did have key players out (mid-season) and we've just about got everyone back now.
"But if I knew exactly what the answer was we'd win every week and I'd bottle it.
"The last two weeks the boys have played better together as a team. It was really obvious, with their body language. They were very upbeat."
Liam and Chris Ainsworth scored five tries between them in the 10-tries-to-three display against the last-placed Crushers.
"I know Nambour is struggling with players but they still had Marty Cordwell and Donald Malone," Irwin said.
Harrison Langer, the son of Queensland legend Allan, has enjoyed a strong season but on Saturday suffered a suspected fractured toe.
Maroochydore and Kawana have locked up first and second place respectively. The Swans beat Caboolture 28-14 at Buderim and Kawana beat Noosa 26-12 at Tewantin.
