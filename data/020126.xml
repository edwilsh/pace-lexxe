  <title>Man chases pedestrians with pole in terrifying Surfers Paradise rampage</title>
  <content>
A man is on the run after he chased pedestrians down the street while brandishing a metal pole in Surfers Paradise.
Video showed the man running down Cavill Avenue brandishing what appeared to be a fence paling this afternoon.

Terrified pedestrians fled the area to avoid being caught in the man's path.

No one is believed to have been seriously injured.

Police arrived to the scene after being called by 9NEWS, but officers have been unable to locate the man.

Anyone who sees the man has been urged not to approach him, and call Triple Zero immediately.
