  <title>Government's same-sex marriage plebiscite attempt expected to be blocked by Senate</title>
  <content>
The Senate is expected to reject the Federal Government's second attempt at holding a same-sex marriage plebiscite, clearing the way for a postal vote by the end of the year.
After a two-hour partyroom debate, , defeating a push by some backbenchers for a free vote in Parliament.
Only seven Liberals voted in favour of change: Warren Entsch and Trevor Evans (Qld); Tim Wilson and Jason Wood (Vic); John Alexander and Trent Zimmerman (NSW); and Senator Dean Smith (WA).
In a bid to quell the internal unrest while honouring its election commitment, the Coalition will try for a second time to hold a plebiscite and if that fails, it has promised to hold a postal vote to settle the issue.
Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said he hoped the bill for a plebiscite would go to the Senate this week.
"Our preference is to give the Australian people a say through a compulsory attendance plebiscite," he said.
"Should that not succeed through the Senate, the Government believes that there is a legal and constitutional way forward to give the Australian people a say through a non-legislated, voluntary postal plebiscite."
The minister would not say how much a postal vote would cost, nor how it would work, and opponents have already vowed to launch a legal challenge.

Postal vote the 'second-best option'

Some Liberal MPs are also uneasy about the idea with former prime minister Tony Abbott, Kevin Andrews, Craig Kelly, Julian Lesser and Russell Broadbent all raising concerns about a postal plebiscite during the special meeting on Monday.
Mr Kelly told the ABC that it was clearly the "second-best option" given concerns about its voluntary nature and looming legal challenges.
Liberal MP Warren Entsch, who is a long time same-sex marriage advocate, also said the postal plebiscite was problematic.
"I think there are some serious prickles and serious warts that may not be able to be removed," he said.
Mr Entsch said he was disappointed with the outcome of Monday's meeting and reserved the right to agitate for another free vote on same-sex marriage should the plebiscite return a no vote, potentially crossing the floor to side with Labor.
"I have put it on the record, if it comes back no, I reserve my right as a Liberal to call on a vote," he said.

The Government is hoping the option of a voluntary postal vote will pressure the crossbench into changing their minds on the plebiscite.
But South Australian senator Nick Xenophon, who controls a crucial bloc of three votes, has indicated he would again refuse to support a plebiscite, while Victorian senator Derryn Hinch said he would also reject it again.
"A conscience vote is the only way to go," he said.
Mr Turnbull was strongly opposed to postal plebiscites during the height of the republican debate in 1997, saying it could disenfranchise some voters.
"Part of the problem with voluntary voting is that it does disenfranchise people. I mean, I believe that people should be obliged to vote," he said.
