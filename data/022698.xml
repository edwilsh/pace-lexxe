  <title>Big Joe to miss three games for Broncos</title>
  <content>
BRONCOS big man Joe Ofahengaue has accepted a three-week suspension for an ugly spear tackle on Titans youngster Max King, with the club confirming an early guilty plea would be entered.
Ofahengaue (pictured) was hit with a grade three dangerous throw charge for the tackle that drove King into the turf on his head.
The 21-year-old will miss crucial clashes against the Sharks, Dragons and Eels after choosing not to risk a five week suspension buy fighting the charge at the judiciary.
He will return for the Broncos' final home and away clash of the season, a potential top-four deciding blockbuster away to the Cowboys.
Meanwhile, Ofahengaue's teammate James Roberts has been fined $1650 for his involvement in a scuffle with ex-teammate Ryan James, while Knights winger Chanel Mata'utia copped a grade one tripping charge that also attracted a fine.
