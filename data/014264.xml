Robbie Williams on the red carpet at the 2016 ARIA Awards

HE™S sold more than 70 million albums, has six of the top 100 best-selling records in British history, and he™s heading to the Adelaide 500.

Robbie Williams, whose 14 number one hits include classics like Angels, Let Me Entertain You and Rock DJ, will perform his only Adelaide show on the Sunday night of race weekend.

Organisers are hailing Williams as a coup, saying it's likely to be the biggest concert in the race's 20-year history, topping a line-up that has featured international superstars like Kiss, Motley Crue, Santana, The Doobie Brothers and Rob Thomas, alongside local legends like Keith Urban and the Hilltop Hoods.

The 43-year-old's latest album - The Heavy Entertainment Show - was released in 2016 and reached number 4 on the Australian charts.

Adelaide crowds have a longstanding affection for the former Take That frontman, with his 2006 concert at Football Park drawing a massive crowd of 60,000 people and his 2015 arena tour selling out and garnering rave reviews.

South Australian Minister for Tourism Leon Bignell said it was big news for the state-owned motorsport event.

"Robbie Williams is a world class show man and his performance at next year's Adelaide 500 is destined to make the 2018 event bigger and better than ever," Mr Bignell said.

"Adelaide 500 is not just about motorsport - it's about providing outstanding entertainment and is a perfect opportunity to show off everything our stunning city has to offer.

"I am absolutely thrilled to welcome Robbie Williams as our Sunday night headline act for the 20th anniversary of Adelaide 500."
