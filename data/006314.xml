  <title>Rays pitcher Chris Archer issues 'Declaration of Unfriendliness' against Astros mascot after comparison to Jaden Smith</title>
  <content>
Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Chris Archer took his friendly beef with the Houston Astros mascot to a new level on Monday night.

Archer issued a "Declaration of Unfriendliness" to the prank-minded Orbit.

According to the Declaration, "A STATE OF DISCORD" has existed between the two and Archer vows to retaliate with "a campaign of PRANKS, GAGS AND HIGH JINKS (sic)." You can see the full text of the letter below.

Here is Archer delivering the letter:

It is unclear when Archer became a regular target of Orbit's pranks, but the first high-profile incident occurred in 2015 when Orbit compared Archer to Jaden Smith.

In addition to their Archer's and Smith's similar appearances, the two also like to fill their social media with throught-provoking messages.

Orbit later crumpled up the letter and even ate the phone of Rays sideline reporter Alex Corddry when she tried to take a photo of the letter.

During Monday's game, Orbit donned a disguise as he tried to sneak up on Archer from behind.

Even fans who wear Archer jerseys are not safe from Orbit.

Here is the full "Declaration of Unfriendliness," in its crumpled up glory.

It reads:

"DECLARATION OF UNFRIENDLINESS
"A state of discord has existed between Chris Archer of the and Orbit of the .

"Whereas general mischief and rascality has been among Orbit's repeated trespasses, Chris Archer is hereby resolved to carry on a campaign of pranks, gags and high jinks in retaliation which include, but are not limited to, use of objects such as:
Water balloons

Silly string
Small motorised vehicles
Bubblegum
Hand-crafted signage
"And any of the considerable resources of a Major League clubhouse."
