  <title>Vic ambo response times best June quarter</title>
  <content>
Victoria's paramedics got to more serious cases within time limits in the June quarter than ever before, as the state government says the "crisis" in the ambulance service is over.
Slow response times for ambulances was a major election issue in 2014 but new statistics from the service show Code One response times were at 81 per cent in the June 2017 quarter - up six per cent on the same period last year.
"We said we would end the ambulance crisis, and with more patients now getting the life-saving care they need in record time that's exactly what we've done," Premier Daniel Andrews said on Monday.
