  <title>Brisbane parking costs more than Sydney</title>
  <content>
Brisbane drivers are paying more for short-term off-street parking than people in Sydney and Melbourne, Queensland's peak motoring group says.
After surveying 150 parking stations across the city, the RACQ found it cost a Brisbane driver an average of $28.32 to stop for an hour compared to $28.08 in Sydney and $20.56 in Melbourne.
RACQ spokesman Paul Turner described Brisbane's short-term parking as "very expensive" and full day prices as "outrageous".
