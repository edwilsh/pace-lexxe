  <title>Decmil to supply modular cells for NZ</title>
  <content>
Perth-based engineering and construction group Decmil has won a contract for the supply of rapidly deployable modular prison cells at two prisons in New Zealand.
The NZ Zealand Department of Correction has appointed Decmil (ASX: DCG) as its preferred contractor for the NZ$60 million project (A$56m), which will cover the design, procurement and on-site installation of the cells.
The contract represents a further expansion of Decmil's business in New Zealand, where it is now active in a number of sectors including education, corrections, defence and commercial building.
Contract negotiations between Decmil and NZ Corrections are expected to be completed by the end of this month.
Decmil has identified correctional services as a key target market, building on the company's recent projects in defence and immigration. The company also has a long-established track record of building FIFO villages for some of Western Australia's largest resources projects.
