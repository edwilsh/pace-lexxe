  <title>Two court wins, three losses: NSW govt</title>
  <content>
The NSW government has scored two wins but three losses in court days after it walked away from a policy of forced council amalgamations in Sydney.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Thursday abandoned the government's fight to forcibly merge more than a dozen Sydney councils.
She cited protracted legal battles with several councils and the uncertainty this was causing ratepayers.
Local Government Minister Gabrielle Upton on Monday said five cases were decided in court.
"There were two wins for the government and three losses, showing the uncertain nature of the court process and underlining the government's position to end the uncertainty," she said in a statement.
Ms Berejiklian in January decided to walk away from planned amalgamations in the bush, but she forged ahead with those in the city.
On Friday, she ruled out allowing those local governments that had already merged to back out of the deal.
