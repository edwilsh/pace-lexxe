  <title>Reading, spelling, numeracy better in Vic</title>
  <content>
Victoria is claiming victory after some preliminary NAPLAN results showed improvement in reading, spelling and numeracy for some grades.
But other NAPLAN figures don't paint such a rosy picture, with the state going backwards in writing while NSW got better.
"The number of kids doing better in numeracy and reading is increasing, and we'll keep investing to ensure results continue to improve," Education Minister James Merlino said on Wednesday.
