  <title>No Brownlow for Patrick Dangerfield after accepting AFL ban</title>
  <content>
Reigning AFL Brownlow Medallist Patrick Dangerfield has accepted his one-match suspension, making him ineligible for this year's award.

The Geelong star would have risked a two-game ban had he challenged his rough conduct charge at the tribunal and lost.

Dangerfield was the favourite to win the medal again and his suspension means Richmond midfielder Dustin Martin heads the betting.

More to come..
