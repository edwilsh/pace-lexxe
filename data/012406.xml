SHOWMAN: The Murlocs singer Ambrose Kenny-Smith is a born performer.

YOU can be mistaken for thinking that all young music fans have deserted rock'n'roll, given EDM and hip-hop's popularity. But the Small Ballroom on Wednesday revealed a room of teenagers and early 20-somethings dancing to the beauty of '60s-inspired rock and R'n'B. The band were Melbourne five-piece The Murlocs, an associate of psych-rockers King Gizzard and the Wizard Lizard. 
Murlocs singer Ambrose Kenny-Smith is a born frontman. Wearing mechanic overhauls, he strutted and belted out cuts from The Murlocs' new album Old Locomotive and last year's Young Blindness. The band have genuine swagger too. The combination of trebly guitar, keyboards and Kenny-Smith's blues harmonica created a rich concoction of rock'n'roll nostalgia with a modern twist.
