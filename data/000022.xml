  <title>Brisbane shrouded in thick fog</title>
  <content>
The Brisbane CBD has been obscured by a thick blanket of fog this morning, which could cause peak-hour traffic woes.
Video shows the city shrouded in fog, with many buildings obscured by the cover.
Brisbane is expected to reach a top of 26C today, so the fog will likely burn off.
The fog could also affect airports already under stress from new security arrangements, with travellers advised to check for any disruptions.
