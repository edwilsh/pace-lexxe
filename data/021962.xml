  <title>Robert Whitwell murder: Accused woman Bernadette Burns admits to charge</title>
  <content>
A Brisbane woman has admitted to murder at an Adelaide court hearing, so will not proceed to trial over the killing of her friend's grandfather.
Bernadette Burns, 22, of Redbank Plains, pleaded guilty in the South Australian Supreme Court to murdering Robert Whitwell, 81, at his home at Craigmore in northern Adelaide last August.
Prosecutors replaced the original murder charge with one to reflect the woman intended to rob Mr Whitwell and cause violence.
Under section 12A of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act, a person is guilty of murder if they cause a death while committing an intentional act of violence as part of another offence.
That must be a major indictable offence which carries a jail term of 10 years or more.
Mr Whitwell's granddaughter Britney Jade Dwyer, 20, also of Redbank Plains, previously admitted to her role in the killing as part of a plan to steal Mr Whitwell's life savings.

Both women were extradited to Adelaide last year to face charges.
They will face court again later in the month for sentencing submissions.
A third woman, Shelbie Lee Angie Holmes, 19, was given a 17-month suspended sentence and put on a three-year $1,000 good behaviour bond, after she admitted she went to Mr Whitwell's house intending to steal money in the months before he was killed.
Holmes pleaded guilty to aggravated serious criminal trespass.
The Supreme Court heard she packed a bag with a knife, gloves and cable ties and drove from Queensland to Adelaide with Dwyer.
It heard a sensor light was activated in the elderly man's backyard and the pair had fled from the property without breaking in.
