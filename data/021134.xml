  <title>World athletics championships 2017: Marathon runner Jess Trengove finishes ninth</title>
  <content>
Jess Trengove thought it was all serendipity, a numerical fate. In her ninth marathon she finished ninth, the same number her brother Jack wears for Melbourne in the AFL.
Spooky. Jack might now ask Jesse Hogan if he can wear his No.1. A golden exchange.

Bolt defeated by Gatlin in final 100m race

Usain Bolt had to settle for bronze in the final of 100m at the IAAF World Championships in London.

Trengove's top 10 finish is the best by an Australian woman at a world championships. With Sinead Diver finishing 20th and Milly Clark 24th, Australia had three women in the top 25.

"This is my ninth marathon and I had a little thing about number nine, it is my brother's footy number, Adam [Didyk] my coach wrote me a little letter before the race saying 'I think there is something special about this number nine thing, run proud out there knowing its your brother's footy number' and then to finish ninth, it's a fairytale," she said.
"I'm really, really happy. To get a few positions higher than my race in Moscow 2013 was good."

For much of the race she looked likely of even pushing for a podium finish. At the 35-kilometre mark she was in the lead. She was dropped by the lead group by the 40km mark but she pushed again and gathered in some of those leaders in the final stages. She eventually finished ninth in two hours 28 minutes and 59 seconds.

Trengove had a critical moment just before the halfway mark when the lead group cut her loose. Ordinarily she would have conservatively stayed within herself, but this time she pushed hard again to bridge the gap.
"A few people were out there and I heard them yell out 'you have got to stay with that pack' and I had to push a bit more than I would like to at that point to get back on them but it was the best thing I did because once you are moving with that pack it is a lot easier, you go with the flow. If I didn't push beyond my comfort zone at that point it could have been a very different race," she said.
The fact that she backed herself to do it, Trengove said, was a sign of her growing maturity and experience.
"I've got belief now that I can do these things in training that I didn't think my body would be capable of in years earlier," she said. "That makes me really excited for the future."
After a ninth and 11th at worlds and a bronze at the Commonwealth Games, the big events evidently suit Trengove. She also likes running in London - she ran her PB at the London marathon only 15 weeks ago and that helped persuade her to push for the worlds despite the relatively short turnaround.
"I think it's because I love running for a greater thing, my country, it brings out the best in me, I kind of thrive on that team environment, spending last four or so days around the other Aussies, getting the energy from them. Having that Australian support out there is really special because the marathon is so mental."
Diver, 40, was 20th in 2:33.26 while Clark ran 2:35.27 for 24th.
In the men's marathon, Australia's best effort was from Jack Colreavy who was 45th in 2:21.44.
