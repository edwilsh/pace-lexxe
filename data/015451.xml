  <title>Perth teen driver dodges jail over death</title>
  <content>
A 21-year-old man who killed a 17-year-old motorcyclist from New Zealand by driving on the wrong side of a dark semi-rural road in Perth's south has avoided an immediate jail term.
Oscar Graetz was 18 when he momentarily swerved over broken white lines into the oncoming lane of the Hopeland road in April 2015, killing Logan Cant almost immediately.
Graetz was sentenced in the District Court of WA on Friday to a two-year suspended jail term and had his drivers' licence disqualified for two-and-a-half years.
