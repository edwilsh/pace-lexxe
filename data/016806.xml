THE latest episode of "Game of Thrones" - which is set to air on HBO Sunday night - has reportedly been leaked online after hackers stole data from the network in a recent breach.
Episode 4 of Season 7 appears to be authentic,
The episode entitled "The Spoils of War," appeared on the subreddit r/freefolk, a popular Game of Thrones discussion board that is not moderated.
Reddit user posted it earlyon Friday morning and said in the comments that it was a "Gift from Pakistan."
HBO released sent out an internal email to employees addressing the hack on Thursday.
"We do not believe that our email system as a whole has been compromised," CEO Richard Plepler wrote.
He added that a review continues, and said HBO is hiring an outside firm to help employees monitor their financial accounts.
On Tuesday, a company called IP-Echelon filed a report with Google on behalf of HBO, noting that the named website "shares thousands of Home Box Office (HBO) internal company documents," reports the Daily News.
