SPOILER ALERT
EAGLE-EYED viewers of Game of Thrones may have spotted a familiar face last night.
Australian actor Brendan Cowell had a blink-and-you-missed-it appearance on the Emmy-winning series. He played the grizzled guy who more or less scolded Theon Greyjoy when the sodden man overboard was pulled out of the water.
Standing over Theon, Cowell's character - in the credits as "Harrag" - says to him with disdain, "You wouldn't be here if you tried [to save her]".
Cowell's casting in GoT was reported earlier this year by fan site Watchers on the Wall and it's expected he'll appear in three episodes this season.

So while he may have been on screen for only a minute in last night's episode, he'll likely have a bigger impact as the story around the defeated Greyjoy fleet unfolds.
In the books, there is a character named Harrag but that character was killed by Bolton men.
Cowell is best known to Australian viewers as Tom from Love My Way but has also had roles in Howzat! Kerry Packer's War, Beneath Hill 60, The Borgias and The Slap among others, plus numerous theatre credits.
He's also an author and his play Reuben Guthrie was staged by Belvoir and then adapted into a film which he directed.

Cowell isn't the only Australian actor to have graced the screen on Game of Thrones. Essie Davis played Lady Crane, the actor Arya tried to save in Braavos last season while Noah Taylor was in eight episodes of season three and four as Locke, a soldier loyal to House Bolton.
