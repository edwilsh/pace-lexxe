  <title>God Forbid gallops back to form at Fannie Bay</title>
  <content>
AFTER an impressive second on debut over 1100m at Fannie Bay on June 24, former Victorian galloper God Forbid hit the wall in his next two starts.
An 11th over 1300m on July 8 was followed by a 10th over 1600m on July 19.
It wasn't looking good for the five-year-old gelding.
However, subtle gear changes and a visit to the vet proved all the difference and on Saturday he bounced back to form with victory in the Darwin RSL Administrator's Handicap (1300m).
Sharing the lead with Leah Walling-Denton's Merveille (Richie Oakford), Tayarn Halter's Puzzled Princess (Kayla Cross) and Garry Lefoe Jnr's Duke Of York (Raymond Vigar), Kerry Petrick's God Forbid ($15) found another gear in the home and eased up at the line to win by two lengths.
John Peacock's Senior Council (Wayne Davis), a $13 hope, was the only member of the backmarkers to make an impression and produced a tremendous finishing burst to seal second place.
Duke Of York ($8.00) finished third ahead of Puzzled Princess ($71) and Merveille ($11).
"The real God Forbid turned up today and I'm glad he did as owners from Melbourne are here today," Petrick said.
"He was having breathing issues with the dust here at Fannie Bay and that affected him in two previous starts.
"We consulted a vet and it has all paid off as everything went right today.
"We did have high hopes for God Forbid when he got to Darwin, but racing is a tough gig and you've got to have some luck."
For winning jockey Felicia Bergstrand, who couldn't buy a winner in the closing stages of the 2016/17 season before losing her lead and ultimately the title in the Top End jockeys premiership, it was her second win of the Carnival after booting Wicked Promise home on Wednesday.
"It's good to be riding winners again and the plan today was to take a sit," Bergstrand said.
"They did go fast early and God Forbid was keen to mix it with the leaders.
"He has taken a while to settle in Darwin and he has had his struggles, but he fought on well today."
Sadly, Kevin Lamprecht's Heirdom (Barry Huppatz) bleed during the race and finished at the rear of the field behind the other 11 runners.
