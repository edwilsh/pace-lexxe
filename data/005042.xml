  <title>Westhoff signs new deal at Port Adelaide</title>
  <content>
PORT Adelaide swingman Justin Westhoff is off the AFL free agent list with a new deal at Alberton for next season.

Westhoff, 30, was assured a new deal when he played his 15th AFL game this season. He closed negotiation on Tuesday ensuring a 12th AFL season at Alberton after being the No. 71 pick in the 2006 national draft.

"I love the club and had no interest in exploring free-agency," said Westhoff, a 221-game player with Port Adelaide.

Power press conference

"This is my home and I'm very happy here.

"The chance to keep playing my role as part of what we're trying to build here at Port Adelaide is exciting. To have the trigger activated now leaves me free to focus on doing my job as part of the team for the rest of the season."

Port Adelaide's free-agent list now has forward-ruckman Jackson Trengove (restricted) and defender Jasper Pittard (unrestricted).
