  <title>When Jerry met Adelaide</title>
  <content>
US FUNNYMAN Jerry Seinfeld was all smiles as he strolled through Adelaide's CBD in the lead up to his Saturday night live gig at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre.
The 63-year-old, who is a huge baseball fan, was wearing his favourite New York Mets cap with his trademark "sneans" -0 sneakers and jeans - a tan blazer and scarf.
Best known for his very famous TV show about nothing, the New Yorker was spotted crossing North Terrace near the old Royal Adelaide Hospital.
He also enjoyed some local hospitality at Jamie's Italian.
Tonight's show is the second of his Seinfeld Live Australian tour dates.
Reviews of last night's Perth performance stated Seinfeld was still one of the world's best stand-up comics.
Seinfeld Live moves to Melbourne tomorrow for three shows, followed by Brisbane, with the tour wrapping up with two Sydney gigs.
It's 19 years since Seinfeld last toured Australia.
