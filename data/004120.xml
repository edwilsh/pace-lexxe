A QUEENSLAND community is in mourning, following the tragic death of a mum of two who died after being hit by a truck last week.
Tributes have poured in for 39-year-old Noosa Council employee, Sharon Cuthbert, .
Mrs Cuthbert was killed on Thursday when she, about 5.10pm.
It is clear Ms Cuthbert had a profound impact on the community, with many people taking to Facebook to mourn an "amazing, lovely, caring friend" that "blessed their lives".
Council CEO Brett de Chastel said Mrs Cuthbert would be 'sorely missed'.
"Our Council is in shock following the tragic loss of Sharon in last Thursday's accident," he said.
"Sharon was a much loved member of our staff having worked at Noosa Council for over 10 years.
"Sharon will be sorely missed.
"Her radiant smile and friendly approach made her so popular with both her colleagues and our customers.
"Our thoughts at this time also go out to her family who are in deep shock at what has happened."
Friend and Noosa News employee Nadia Colbourn said Mrs Cuthbert's maiden name had a special meaning to those who knew her.
"Her first (maiden) name was Angelo, which is Italian for angel," Ms Colbourn said.
"She truly was an angel. She was a sweetheart."
Donations to the family can be made by calling 0431558333.
