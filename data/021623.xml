  <title>Knife-wielding Grafton man dies after being shot by police</title>
  <content>
A man has died in hospital after he was shot by police in northern New South Wales yesterday for allegedly refusing to drop a knife.
The shooting happened after police were called to reports of a disturbance at a home on Turf Street in Grafton just before 3.45pm yesterday.
It's understood the man who was shot was involved in a domestic incident at the home.
When he refused to drop his weapon, police tasered and shot him.
They performed CPR on him at the scene, before he was taken to Grafton Hospital in a critical condition.
He was later transported to the Gold Coast Hospital where he has since died.
A critical incident team will investigate the circumstances surrounding the shooting, and an independent investigation will then examine the findings.
