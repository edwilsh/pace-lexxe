  <title>Principal to talk on Vic rort 'big fish'</title>
  <content>
A former Melbourne school principal who lied under oath to anti-corruption investigators will give evidence against a one-time senior education department manager accused of siphoning off millions of taxpayer dollars.
Michael Giulieri, who used to be principal of Essendon North Primary School, has pleaded guilty to making false or misleading statements to the Independent Broad-Based Anti-Corruption Commission when he was questioned by investigators in 2014.
Victoria's Chief Crown Prosecutor Gavin Silbert QC on Tuesday said Giulieri will give evidence against former education department finance manager Nino Napoli, calling him a "big fish" in the case.
