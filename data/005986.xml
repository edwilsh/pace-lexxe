  <title>Parramatta Eels alter training schedule in preparation for top-four assault</title>
  <content>
The Parramatta Eels have turned to night-time training to continue their push for a top four spot, altering their build-up in preparation for at least another five weeks of football under lights.
The Eels hit the training paddock on Monday night in preparation for Thursday night's ANZ Stadium showdown against old rivals Canterbury, with coach Brad Arthur well aware of his team's schedule over the final month of the regular season.

Did McGuire intentionally stomp Mannah?

Brisbane Bronco Josh McGuire dangerously stood on the ankle of Eels captain Tim Mannah, but was it intentional?

With the Eels flying high on the back of five consecutive wins, the perennial underachievers look set to play finals football for the first time since the Jarryd Hayne-inspired run of 2009.
And their coach isn't leaving any stone unturned, attempting to simulate the match-day conditions his team will confront over the coming weeks as it closes out the regular season with five successive night games.

There's also a strong likelihood the Eels will have to play under lights in the finals, with only one of the nine games in this year's play-offs to be staged during the day.
"I want our boys to try and get used to the dewy conditions," Arthur said. "It's something we might do a few more times this year. We were fortunate enough that it rained [on Monday night] because the forecast for ANZ Stadium on Thursday night is for rain. It's good to get a run under our belt in conditions that should be similar for the Dogs game."

The Eels have been dealt a friendly draw by the NRL, scheduled Thursday and Friday night games for the final six rounds of the season.

After Thursday night's game against the Bulldogs, they take on the Knights and Titans at home before a crucial away clash against the Broncos at Suncorp Stadium in round 25.
The Eels close out the year at home against a struggling South Sydney outfit with only pride to play for, meaning they only face one top-eight team to finish the season.
Arthur is unsure whether he'll continue the night-time training sessions into the finals, but said there were other reasons at play for calling his team in under lights.
"By the time the finals roll around the dewy conditions we're getting used to will probably be gone," Arthur saidPhoto: AAP
"But we also trained at night so that we would have the opportunity to get a full opposed session in. Our NSW Cup team Wenty played on Sunday so half the boys played in that so we didn't have enough for an opposed session. I like to get a 13-on-13 opposed session in so we did it against the NYC boys on Monday night."
The Eels gave lock Nathan Brown the green light to play against the Bulldogs on Thursday night, cleared to return to the paddock after a heavy knock to the head against Brisbane last week.
Brown has been one of the Eels' best so far this season and is a huge inclusion for Parramatta against the big Canterbury pack. Arthur has named the same team that did the job against the Broncos in round 22 as his side looks to move into the top four this weekend.
