  <title>Feds must 'move on' from gay marriage: Guy</title>
  <content>
Victorian Liberal leader Matthew Guy says his federal counterparts need to get their "house in order" on marriage equality.
The state opposition leader supports same-sex marriage and acknowledges his view might be different to many of his federal colleagues, but added that Canberra's constant infighting is distracting from important government business.
"Get your house in order, get the issues solved and moved on to the issues that the country wants debated; the economy, jobs, border security, issues that this government is strong on and need to be talked about," Mr Guy told reporters in Melbourne.
