  <title>Demons set for double boost</title>
  <content>
MELBOURNE coach Simon Goodwin has no reservations about welcoming back experienced duo Nathan Jones and Bernie Vince for Saturday's clash with Greater Western Sydney.
Jones hasn't played since Round 13 while Vince has served a two-match suspension for elbowing, but both will be valuable additions for the Canberra meeting with the Giants.
"Nathan and Bernie - a couple of experienced players are ready to go," he said.
AFL DAILY:
PIES RUMOURS:
"He was pretty close last week, Nath, it was hard to hold him back, but he's 100 per cent ready to go this week."
Goodwin said Vince had "learned his lesson" from the ban.
Corey Maynard will also make his debut, Goodwin confirmed, while Sam Weideman could come in for forward Jesse Hogan.
RICHMOND forward Jack Riewoldt is expected to be named in the Tigers' extended squad to take on Hawthorn at the MCG on Sunday.
Riewoldt missed last Saturday's win over Gold Coast with an eye injury.
The Tigers spearhead said this morning: "I feel pretty strong that I'm going to be right (to play)."
GOLD Coast will welcome back superstar midfielder Gary Ablett for Saturday night's clash with Fremantle at Subiaco.
Ablett's has battled issues with his hamstring but has been declared fit after being withdrawn late from last week's loss to Richmond.
But the Suns will be without ruckman Jarrod Witts for at least Saturday night's clash with Fremantle in Perth with a shoulder problem.
Witts has been a revelation for the Suns and held down the No.1 ruck role but has carried niggles through the season.
The Suns say he could also miss Round 21.
GEELONG will need to find a replacement for suspended gun Patrick Dangerfield but it won't be Steven Motlop with the enigmatic forward set to miss another match with groin soreness.
The Cats will also be without goalkicker Daniel Menzel as he's being managed ahead of the finals and Nakia Cockatoo with a hamstring injury.
Rhys Stanley could force his way back into the team, while coach Chris Scott named Jamaine Jones and Jack Henry as players edging closer to their debut.
ADELAIDE should be boosted by the return of three key players for the must-win Showdown against Port Adelaide.
Eddie Betts (appendix), Brad Crouch (cheekbone) and Jake Lever (hamstring) are all expected to be named tonight.
SYDNEY is expected to name captain Josh Kennedy despite hurting his hamstring in the loss to Hawthorn.
Coach John Longmire said Kennedy had pulled up better than expected but the star midfielder was restricted to stationary skills at training.
But the Swans are likely to give him every chance to play.
Late withdrawals Jake Lloyd (hip) and Gary Rohan (back) are also a chance to return, while Sam Reid is also in the mix to face the Cats tomorrow night after missing two matches with a groin problem.
