  <title>WA premier 'disappointed' with PM's visit</title>
  <content>
WA Premier Mark McGowan says he cannot put the prime minister in a headlock to get a better share of the GST revenue, but has vowed to maintain political pressure as Malcolm Turnbull finished his week in the west.
WA receives the lowest share of GST revenue and the state government this week urged Canberra to intervene over new census figures downgrading WA's population it says could lead to another $1.9 billion drop in GST.
The premier said he was disappointed with Mr Turnbull's visit to WA this week and hoped the prime minister would have more to offer next time.
