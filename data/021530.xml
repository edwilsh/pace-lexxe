  <title>'It's not the perfect script': Coe laments Gatlin's 100m victory over Bolt</title>
  <content>
London: IAAF president Sebastian Coe admits Justin Gatlin's win in the 100 metres at the World Athletics Championships was not the perfect script for the sport.
American Gatlin, who has served two suspensions for doping offences, ruined Usain Bolt's fairytale farewell on Saturday by beating the Jamaican sprint great in his final ever individual race.

Bolt defeated by Gatlin in final 100m race

Usain Bolt had to settle for bronze in the final of 100m at the IAAF World Championships in London.

Gatlin was booed by the crowd following his victory and again on Sunday when he returned to the stadium to receive his gold medal. 
Bolt came third, behind Gatlin and 21-year-old American Christian Coleman.

"I'm not eulogistic that someone who has served two bans has walked off with one of our glittering prizes. But he is eligible to be here," Coe, the head of the sport's governing body, told the BBC.
"It's not the perfect script. I thought Usain was very generous with the observations he made. That must have been a bitter event for him to swallow. He was bigger than the moment and it typifies his career."

Coe, who presented Gatlin's medal, reiterated his support for life bans for convicted drug cheats.

Gatlin received a two-year ban in 2001 after failing a dope test for amphetamines found in prescribed medication he had been taking since a child for Attention Deficit Disorder. This suspension was later reduced to one year on appeal.

This ban, however, was also halved by an arbitration panel in 2007.
"There have been two bans in the past," Coe said.Photo: AP
"One got watered down, which made it very difficult for the second ban. The second ban, we went for an eight-year ban, which would have, in essence, been a life ban. We lost that."
Efforts to impose lengthy suspensions on doping offenders have often been overturned in courts or by arbitration panels, with appeals sometimes citing inconsistencies with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) code.Photo: AP
WADA only updated its code from January 2015 to allow a four-year ban for first- time offenders, up from two years.
