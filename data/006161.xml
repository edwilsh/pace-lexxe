  <title>Credit Union SA cracks $1bn in assets</title>
  <content>
CREDIT Union SA has broken the $1 billion asset mark, thanks in part to a growing member base and array of services according to its chief executive.
Grant Strawbridge said the milestone showed the appeal of the customer-owned approach to banking and the culmination of initiatives to grow member numbers and position the local financial services provider as an attractive banking option for South Australians.
The organisation is owned by its almost 50,000 members.
"As an employer of more than 150 South Australians, Credit Union SA continues to be a significant contributor to the local economy and we are proud of our standing within the SA business community - and to reach more than $1 billion in assets reflects our role and responsibility in the development of our state," Mr Strawbridge said.
"We are extremely proud that becoming a billion-dollar organisation allows us to demonstrate the value of our organisation for our members but also our important role supporting the prosperity of the broader SA economy."
