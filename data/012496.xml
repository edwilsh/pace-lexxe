  <content>
THE State Library had to be evacuated and two people taken to hospital when hazardous fumes filled part of the premises.
Emergency services were called to the State Library on North Tce in the city about 12.30pm on Thursday when two people, believed to be staff members, were overcome by fumes.
Initial calls to emergency services reported the noxious smell may have been paint fumes.
The library was evacuated while Metropolitan Fire Service hazardous materials personnel investigated and ventilated the building.
Two people were taken to the Royal Adelaide Hospital in a stable condition, an SA Ambulance Service spokeswoman said.
The library was reopened to the public about 1.30pm.
