  <title>Motorway death jury fails to agree</title>
  <content>
THE Supreme Court jury deliberating the fate of a man accused of a one-punch attack on the Gateway Motorway, has been dismissed after failing to reach a verdict.
The jury told Justice Peter Applegarth it was at a "complete impasse" and couldn't reach a unanimous verdict.
Tamate Henry Heke, 38, pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and an alternative charge of unlawful striking causing death, in the Brisbane Supreme Court last Monday.
Shane Merrigan, 50, died on December 1, 2015, after he was allegedly punched by Heke and then fell under the wheels of an oncoming garbage truck on the Gateway Motorway at Eight Mile Plains south of Brisbane.
Heke said Mr Merrigan had been tailgating him and had then motioned for him to pull over.
The jury retired to consider its verdict last Friday morning but after less than eight hours sent Justice Peter Applegarth a note about midday today, saying it was at a "complete impasse" and that it had tried to reach a unanimous verdict in various ways, but had failed so far.
Justice Applegarth directed them to keep trying and adjourned the court until at least 1.30pm. He said he could accept a majority verdict.
Just before 3pm the jury said it was "absolutely deadlocked" and it was dismissed without reaching a verdict.
Justice Applegarth said it was a difficult case "on many levels".
The case will be re-listed for trial at a later date.
