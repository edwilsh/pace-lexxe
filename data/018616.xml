  <title>Jean-Claude Juncker: Britain is struggling to produce 'coherent answers' on Brexit</title>

European Commission President Juncker: Britain will soon wake up to the "density of problems" thrown up on a "daily basis" by Brexit.

Juncker doesn't believe will be reversed.

The Trump administration is "stunning" and organised badly, Juncker adds.

LONDON - European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker says Brexit is producing "problems on a daily basis" that the British side is failing to give "coherent" answers too.

, the European Union's most senior figure talked down suggestions that Britain's departure from the EU could be reversed but suggested the UK government is yet to realise the true complexity of the process.

"People will become more and more conscious of the density of problems on a daily basis, without always being able to provide a coherent answer to these problems," he told Politico in a wide-ranging interview.

Prime Minister Theresa May triggered Article 50 in March but since then her government has failed to articulate clearly what it wants to achieve in Brexit negotiations. A former UK negotiator to the EU  that figures in Brussels are "baffled" by Britain's perceived lack of preparation for divorce talks, adding May is handling talks in the "absolute worst way" possible.

However, Juncker does not believe confusion over Brexit in Britain will lead to the decision being reversed.

"I don't go as far as the Maltese prime minister [Joseph Muscat] who has not ruled out that it will not come to Brexit," Juncker said.  that Brexit might not happen due to doubts among Leave voters.

"My working hypothesis is that it will come to Brexit," Juncker said.

The Trump administration is "stunning"

Juncker didn't hold back when asked for his assessment of the administration of US President Donald Trump.

The Commission President described recent chaos within US government as "stunning" and claimed the EU is "better organised" than the White House.

"We are better organised than the Trump administration. That is because if there are any internal difficulties, those difficulties are fixed in a direct conversation instead of by firing people," Juncker said.

Last week Trump fired White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci despite the latter having only been in the job for 10 days.
