USHER had better lawyer up.
Lisa Bloom, the lawyer who represented Mischa Barton and Blac Chyna in their , says she is filing a California lawsuit Monday on behalf of two women and a man who allege the crooner gave them herpes.
The accusers claim, "Usher had sexual contact with them after 2012, and failed to warn them of his alleged STD, as required by law," according to a news release Bloom sent out Friday.
One woman will speak at a press conference in New York on Monday. The other two will be named in the complaint as Jane Doe and John Doe and will remain private.
According to reports, Usher settled a lawsuit in 2012 with an unnamed woman who claims to have contracted the virus from him.
Usher, 38, has been married to Grace Miguel since 2015. He and first wife Tameka Foster split in 2009.
Usher's reps didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
