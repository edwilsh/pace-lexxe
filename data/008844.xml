  <title>Everything we know about the iPhone 8</title>
  <content>
Media reports and analysts say that Apple will launch an iPhone this year with a edge-to-edge screen and no home button.

Apple seemingly confirmed this rumour with a picture included in recently released software.

Apple has launched a new iPhone in September for the last five years.

Apple is widely expected to launch new iPhones in September. 

There's been a ton of speculation and reports about the upcoming iPhone, which is expected to be completely redesigned. 

The pressure is on Apple, too. It's the 10th anniversary of the first-ever iPhone, launched in 2007, and the company is expected to have some big plans to mark the occasion.

Wall Street analysts hope the new iPhone drives a "" of sales, propelling Apple to  become the first trillion-dollar publicly-traded company. 

Apple rarely comments on upcoming products, but some accidentally-released code from Apple suggests some of the rumours may be accurate.

Here's what you need to know about the upcoming iPhone.
