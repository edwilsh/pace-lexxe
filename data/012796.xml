  <title>Major blaze at world's biggest fish market</title>
  <content>
Dozens of firefighters have battled a major blaze at Tokyo's Tsukiji fishmarket, the world's largest and one of the capital's most popular tourist sites.
There were no immediate reports of injuries or people trapped.
The fire broke out just before 5pm local time (6pm AEST) on Thursday.
Clouds of smoke billowed into the air as efforts to put out the flames were hampered by the area's narrow streets and tight-knit buildings.
The fire was in Tsukiji's "outer" market - an area packed with informal restaurants where tourists can tuck into fresh seafood plates and sushi.
Media reports said it spread to four buildings.
The Tsukiji "inner" market, where most seafood wholesalers are and tuna auctions are carried out at dawn, was not affected.
Tsukiji draws tens of thousands of visitors a year to its warren of stalls laden with exotic species of fish, huge tuna and fresh sushi, part of a tourism boom that is a key part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic plan.
