  <title>CPA Australia board dragged before senate inquiry over ongoing scandal</title>
  <content>
CPA Australia's remaining board members are set to face a grilling before the powerful senate economics committee.

Key points:

CPA Australia debacle prompted a senate inquiry to improve corporate governance across all businesses
Issue centres on board transparency with members and shareholders
Despite pressure, CPA still blocking moves to communicate with disaffected members

The debacle at CPA has already seen the sacking of high profile CEO Alex Malley, as well as the resignation of more than half of the CPA board.
Mr Malley was given an almost $5 million dollar payout on his way out in late June, on top of his .
Senior CPA staffers faced a barrage of questions from the committee at a hearing in Sydney, as they were called to explain their lack of communication with CPA members during the organisation's governance crisis.
The hearing formed part of the committee's examination of a proposed update to the Corporations Act - in large part arising from the issues at CPA - that would compel companies to collect their members' and shareholders' email addresses, and allow them to be shared.
While reform is the long game for the senators, most of the immediate grilling concerned CPA's governance crisis.
"The extraordinary behaviour of this organisation, the obfuscation, the opacity, is just mind-blowing," Liberal senator Jane Hume told the hearing.
When asked why CPA hadn't passed on  of the organisation calling for a spill of the current board, the general manager of policy and corporate affairs at CPA, Stuart Dignam, replied that CPA's own independent review would look into that question.
"We do have an independent review ... and it has broad terms of reference to enquire into CPA Australia," he told the hearing.
"The board and the management of CPA Australia don't believe that an entire spill of the board is in the best interests of the organisation," he said.
Big business not happy

Outside the hearing, Senator Nick Xenophon said the remaining directors of CPA would be called before the committee within the next fortnight.
"We want to hear from them about arrangements such as the former CEO Alex Malley getting a $4.9 million payout," he said.
The fiery hearing came about after a rebel CPA member, Brett Stevenson began asking questions about CPA's lavish spending - much of which was focussed on promoting Mr Malley's TV show and biography - and wanted to communicate with other CPA members.
Mr Stevenson had to rely on the Corporations Act to force CPA to release its members register - but found himself with a list of postal addresses.
Mr Stevenson says a mailout would have cost about $160,000.
"It's made it impossible for us to communicate with the members, we just haven't been able to," he said.
Mr Stevenson's experience prompted Senator Nick Xenophon to sponsor a private members bill that would mandate the inclusion of email addresses in the members register of corporations.
"If email addresses are available to a company's board of directors, they should also be available for legitimate purposes to members," he said.
"It's time to bring the Corporations Act into the 21st century."
But some big players say there will be problems with the proposed amendment.
The insurer AMP says it only has the emails of about a third of its shareholders, whose average age is 75.
The Australian Institute of Company Directors has warned in a submission to the committee, that email addresses could be sold on the dark web.
CPA dissidents still battling the board

As for the CPA's governance, it's still an uphill battle for dissident members who want to see the end of the current board.
CPA member Jen Dalitz is leading the push for a board spill.

"It's taken us quite some time for us to re-engage with those members, and to do it off our own bat, given that CPA refuses to facilitate that process and really hear from members," she said.
Ms Dalitz needs 6,000 CPA members to sign a resolution to spill the board.
"We say the remaining members of the board need to leave and they need to leave now - and if they wont leave now, we will pass a resolution requiring them to be removed."
With ASIC's investigation into CPA still underway ... an uncomfortable morning at a senate hearing could be the least of the worries in the CPA boardroom.
