  <title>Trump starts the week by tweeting there's 'no WH chaos' after days of turmoil</title>
  <content>
President Donald Trump started off the week by defending his first six months in office and claiming there was no White House "chaos" - .

"Highest Stock Market EVER, best economic numbers in years, unemployment lowest in 17 years, wages raising, border secure, S.C.: No WH chaos!," .

However, even in a young presidency marked by drama, Trump's last week has been particularly gruelling. Business Insider's  that "Trump may have just had his 'worst week' yet."

"The president . The White House communications director publicly attacked the White House chief of staff. The White House ," Bertrand wrote.

Trump started off the week by bashing Attorney General Jeff Sessions, calling him "beleaguered" in a tweet. The president also tweeted that Sessions had taken "a VERY weak position" on Hillary Clinton's "crimes."

This schism between the president and his attorney general quickly became overshadowed by a public feud between the White House's new communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus. Scaramucci's comments over the course of the week veered into the obscene, and at one point he compared the relationship between the two to Cain and Abel - a Biblical tale in which one brother kills the other.

By the end of the week, Scaramucci's comments seemed to be proved right - Priebus was pushed out of the West Wing as the shortest-serving chief of staff in White House history. Former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly starts in the job Monday.

Outside the White House, Washington was immersed in ongoing drama involving the healthcare debate. The GOP's plan to repeal Obamacare took a sharp and surprising downturn early Friday morning as Senate Republican's latest bill failed.

Trump also touched on health care Monday morning, , "If ObamaCare is hurting people, & it is, why shouldn't it hurt the insurance companies & why should Congress not be paying what public pays?"
