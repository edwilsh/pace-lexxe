  <title>APS risks digital brain drain without change, minister warns</title>

The government's digital agency is leading a bid to keep more IT workers in the public service amid warnings it risks a brain drain to the private sector if nothing changes.

"The private sector is well ahead of us in terms of signing up talent," he said. 
The government body charged with improving the public service's IT, the Digital Transformation Agency, has embarked on work to attract more tech workers, support staff better and build the skills of their bosses.
The federal government will expand IT entry-level positions and increase training as part of digital programs being co-designed by the DTA and the Australian Public Service Commission.
It wants to recruit 250 entry-level tech staff into agencies in the next year. 

Public servants told a 2015 APS survey they knew their agencies needed to make greater progress adopting new technology, but felt under-equipped.
Mr Taylor said among changes needed was a new understanding of contracting that let smaller tech players into the government's projects to upgrade digital infrastructure.

The government has vowed a new approach that would see big IT projects broken up into smaller components to avoid large-scale mishaps and more work outsourced to small, local firms in a shift away from tech giants.
"You need to be able to contract in a clever way, with smaller contracts and shorter timeframes," Mr Taylor said. 
"This contracting skill is one of the key skills we need to develop inside government."
The federal government  nearly $10 billion  last financial year, a massive boost of nearly $3 billion since the Coalition came to power.
Canberra was poised to benefit from the government's increased tech spend and had the potential to be a world-class hub of IT players in Australia, Mr Taylor said. 
"This is a huge opportunity for Canberra. Government will always be a big part of Canberra's economy but so too can IT."
