  <title>Moon Devil right on time for Cup tilt</title>
  <content>
Darwin trainer Kerry Petrick does not buy into the talk of "peaking too early" before big races.
Her nine-year-old gelding Moon Devil will take some excellent form into the $200,000 Darwin Cup at Fannie Bay tomorrow.
The veteran stayer finished third in the $24,000 Ben & Sarah for Breakfast Average Benchmark Handicap (1600m) on July 8.
He then saluted in the $45,000 Million Dollar Fish Buntine Handicap (1900m) on July 22.
"No. He's peaking right when he's supposed to be," Petrick said after she was asked if Moon Devil had peaked too early.
"Everything has gone right with him. That's half the battle when you go into a race.
"He's a last-start winner. It'll be a tough race but I could not be happier with the horse.
"He's on song."
A galloper needs stacks of class but also plenty of toughness to win the Darwin Cup.
And Moon Devil has both, plus 66 races of experience.
"He did a lot of hard work (in the Buntine Handicap) and toughed it out to the line," Petrick said.
"Since that run he's done everything right. Love his barrier (three) - he's drawn well."
Moon Devil finished ninth in a disappointing run in last year's Darwin Cup.
He has the experience to bounce back from that in the 2017 edition.
"He knows his business. He's an old fella now and he knows how to do it," Petrick said.
Petrick said Moon Devil's first place in the SKY Racing Handicap (2000m) in Alice Springs on May 1 set him up beautifully for a big Carnival.
"He came off that good win in Alice Springs and he's at his best at the right time," she said.
"I thought so (that win was a good indication he'd go well in the Carnival).
"We just need some luck and we'll see if he's good enough."
Paul Denton rode Moon Devil to victory in the Buntine Handicap and will be aboard again tomorrow.
