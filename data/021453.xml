It's been dubbed "the Blizzard of Oz", and powder hounds could not be happier.
Australia's ski resorts in the Snowy Mountains, in New South Wales, and Victoria's Alpine National Park were covered with the white stuff this morning after both reported the best falls of the season at the weekend.
More than 1.15 metres of snow has been dumped at Thredbo from Friday morning to 6:00am today.

"It's the best conditions of the season without a shadow of a doubt," resort spokesperson Susie Diver said.
"The accommodation was absolutely chock-a-block. It's absolutely stunning, so beautiful.
"It's a light dry powder. I've never seen so many locals out on a Monday morning. Everyone I've spoken to says it's amazing out there."
The conditions made for spectacular photos, with holidaymakers snapping conditions more akin to Europe and Canada.

Victoria's alpine areas were hit with blizzard conditions, with skiers
At Mt Hotham, the falls were dubbed "The Blizzard of Oz", with about 80cm falling in the past 24 hours.
"There's more coming today and overnight," Larissa Kuzeff from the resort's management board said.

"There's amazing powder. I'm a bit sad that I'm not out there today. It's fantastic conditions.
"It's the Blizzard of Oz and it's brought a lot of snow.
"It's been the best skiing since 2004 up here at Hotham."
