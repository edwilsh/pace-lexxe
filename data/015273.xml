The 30 different nationalities represented at West Wollongong Public School were highlighted during a cultural day event on Friday celebrating Education Week.
A multicultural disco saw students dance along to Syrian, Russian, Chinese, Ghanian and Sri Lankan music before chilling out to enjoy a mini-multicultural film festival.
The 230 students then joined staff and the school community for a cultural picnic.

School principal Michelle Barnes said students brought along food from their culture to share with others at the picnic.

''The Syrian community are amazing cooks. Their food is absolutely amazing,'' she said.

''It is great to celebrate the arts and food of the many cultures that make up our school community.''

Ms Barnes said 20 per cent of the school community are refugees, mainly Syrian students who have relocated here in the last 18 months.
