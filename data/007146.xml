Following the capture of the Raqqa Children's Hospital in southwestern Raqqa city on July 25, Kurdish forces found a number of families besieged by nearby fighting. On July 28, dozens were evacuated by US-backed Manbij Military Council fighters. The Manbij Military Council, a faction of the Syrian Democratic Forces comprised of Kurds, Turkmen, and Arabs, was established in 2016 during the launch of the US-backed Raqqa Offensive. While their primary base of operations is in the Manbij District, they were recently deployed towards Raqqa during the fourth stage of the offensive to retake the city.
