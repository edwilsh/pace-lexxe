  <title>Injuries hit as Swans wait on six of the best</title>

Josh Kennedy injured his hamstring in the loss to Hawthorn

SYDNEY captain Josh Kennedy heads a long list of players in doubt for Friday night's crucial clash with Geelong at Simonds Stadium.

Kennedy struggled with a hamstring problem during the Swans' six-point loss to Hawthorn last week, managing just 14 possessions in his 200th game at the MCG.

The skipper failed to train at the SCG on Monday, with injured teammates Jake Lloyd (hip), Sam Reid (groin), Gary Rohan (back), Callum Sinclair (ankle) and Sam Naismith (side) also on light duties.

Longmire said he was hopeful all six could train at Wednesday's main session, and the news on Kennedy's hamstring was positive.

"He's pulled up better than expected, but we're not sure if he'll play this week or not," he said.

"He had a scan and it's a little bit inflamed, but there's no black or white answers in these situations.

"The coaches, the medical staff and the player all have a massive say in these decisions, and they happen every week.

"That's why we don't have match committee early in the week these days because there's just no point, you don't have the information in front of you."
