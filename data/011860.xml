  <title>Hodor just all but confirmed a wild Game of Thrones theory about Jamie and Cersei Lannister's parents</title>
  <content>
A wild Game of Thrones theory about Cersei and Jamie Lannister just got a little less wilder.

Kristian Nairn, who played Hodor for six seasons in the HBO hit series, appeared on Sky Atlantic's post-episode rundown Thronecast this week, and let this slip when talking about the twins:

Kristian Nairn getting his facts wrong / confirming the Jaime / Cersei = Targaryen theory.
- Ed (@GetTheRockets)

In case you missed it:

"...with their family history and with their father, obviously being the Mad King"

Nairn backtracked on the claim on Twitter soon after:

I just said the wrong name .. had to bone up on two episodes I hadn't seen too , so got a bit befuddled haha
- Kristian Nairn (@KristianNairn)

But the damage had been done, and besides, Nairn's full reference gave away a bit more detail than his backtrack suggests. He added that perhaps Jamie, noting Cersei's increasingly ruthless behaviour, has "seen the warning signs before and maybe he might be a little worried about that".

Cersei certainly has shown a fondness for killing her enemies with fire.

The rumour that the Mad King - Aerys Targaryen - might have impregnated Tywin Lannister's wife Joanna, has been kicking around for a couple of years as Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin spoke more of Aerys' obsession with her in the latest books in the series.

But until now, it was more widely thought that . Now it turns out Tyrion may be the only true rightful Lannister heir.

Jamie and Cersei, however, could be Daenerys's half-siblings, . In the books, Cersei - fittingly - had a crush on Rhaegar, who might have been her brother. And Jamie, like his little brother Tyrion, may have killed his own father when he plunged a sword into the Mad King's back.

And the only thing that could make Tywin Lannister hate Tyrion more than the thought he was not his son is the thought that Tyrion is his only son.

Juicy. In fact, Nairn's slip came within 24 hours of Decider's Meghan O'Keefe finally having the courage to tell readers .

Here's to that call:
