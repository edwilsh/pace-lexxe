  <title>SC2067: Family's sustainable, natural vision for Sunshine Coast</title>
  <content>
WARANA mum Gemma Cox hopes the children of 2067 will be able to enjoy the same natural attractions she did during her youth.

She and husband Tom have chosen to raise their 18-month-old son William on the Sunshine Coast.

"It's always been home for me and I've got quite fond memories of growing up," Mrs Cox, 30, said.

Surfing and spending time at the beach as well as enjoying the support of the Coast community were highlights.

"I guess growing up here I've got a lot of friends and connections and support."

Mrs Cox expected the region's sense of community would remain strong in 50 years.

"I'd like to think that will never change."

She hoped children would still be able to play on the beach at Kawana and get around the Coast safely.

The region's natural beauty was also important to her.

"Even though it has had huge growth, it has kept its beauty."

from  on .

Mr Cox hoped the work/ life ratio would lean more towards the latter 50 years from now.

"Hopefully we are not working as hard and there is a better ratio between the cost of living and a wage," Mr Cox, 31, said.

He moved to the Coast with his wife about five years ago having grown up in New Zealand.

The strong sense of community he has experienced since then was also important to him.

"It is reasonably safe.

"For that to still be there would be great."

Mr Cox hoped the Coast would be 100 per cent powered by renewable energy.

He also hoped public transport would be more practical.

"The big thing for me is that it is cost effective and for the greater good of everyone."
