  <title>Here's what it's like on 'Billionaire's Beach,' the exclusive stretch of sand in the US where a music mogul sold his home for $85 million</title>
  <content>
Nicknamed "Billionaire's Beach" - an homage to the ultra-wealthy residents who call it home - Carbon Beach is a 2.4km stretch of sand that sits between the iconic Pacific Coast Highway and the glistening Pacific Ocean in Malibu, California.

Up until mid-2015, the beach was largely closed off to the public. But now, after a decades-long,  between the state and homeowners, its 70-plus residences share their backyard with tourists and beachgoers from sun up to sun down.

We took a walk down Billionaire's Beach on a recent summer day - scroll through to take a peek at what it's like to live and play on .
