  <title>Chinese police arrest 77 in Fiji</title>
  <content>
An extraordinary story has come to light in Fiji after Chinese state newsagency, Xinhua, reported that 77 people suspected of involvement in a fraud syndicate had been "brought back" to China from Fiji.
Photographs on Xinhua's website show a group of people at the Changchun Longija International airport, each person's head covered with a black hood and each flanked by two police officers.
There's been no confirmation about whether the group was formally extradited.
Fiji human rights lawyer Aman Ravindra-Singh says Fiji police have only said they were working with the Chinese police, but have provided no details about their operation.
Mr Ravindra-Singh says the first he heard of Chinese police in Fiji was after he was contacted by a client.
