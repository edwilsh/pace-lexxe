GET ready to tune up and rock out at the Melbourne Guitar Show.
Returning to Caulfield racecourse on Saturday and Sunday the show brings together lovers of acoustic and electric guitars, the ukulele and banjo. Highly anticipated performers include Canadian virtuoso Nick Johnston and Steve Hackett from Genesis.
Melbourne acoustic guitarists Opal Ocean will take the stage on both days, alongside a host of international artists.
"Melbourne's the place for music and it's just great to have events like this," band member Nadav Tabak said.
"We're releasing a new single in a couple of months and we will be adding a sneaky preview of it into our performance as well."
More than 80 exhibitions will feature state-of-the-art guitar technology. A variety of acoustic and electric models will be displayed.
Attendees will also be able to pick up a trick or two from information seminars.
Question-and-answer sessions will be conducted on both days.
