Tinder has reportedly discussed a £12million deal to sponsor Manchester United's new kit.

, the dating app is in talks to buy space on the left sleeve of players' shirts.

If the deal goes ahead, fans could see Tinder's recognisable flame logo on the shirts as early as August 8, when their new season begins.

Sponsorship of the shirt sleeve is a new money-making venture for English clubs. Nine Premier League sides have already agreed multi-million-pound contracts.

Manchester City has the best-paid deal, earning £10 million a year from Nexen, a South Korean tire manufacturer.

, United is planning to sign the biggest sleeve deal of them all as an agreement with Tinder could be worth £12 million a year to Jose Mourinho's side.

Tinder, which has 50 million users, has made football sponsorship deals before, including a deal with Italian time Napoli, who play in the top Serie A league.

As part of the deal, Napoli striker Arkadiusz Milik has an active dating profile on the app.

Business Insider has contacted Manchester United and Tinder.
