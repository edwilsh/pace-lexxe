  <title>Ingebrigtsen just keeps racking up the wins</title>

CULTURE is the most important word at rugby league clubs and Tye Ingebrigtsen has built a career on establishing winning ones.
The Mareeba Gladiators coach is on the verge of his 50th A-grade win inside three seasons when his side face Brothers at Davies Park tonight - a match that could seal a top-three finish. Mareeba veteran Ian King said bringing Ingebrigtsen to the club was one of the best decisions Gladiators management had made in the club's history, resulting in a massive turnaround in results and attitude.
"I think Tye has probably brought a lot of professionalism to the club," he said.
"At training everyone knows their roles and players know they have to be there to get a spot in the squad and he's built a really good culture in the squad."
King helps out with the junior development program Ingebrigtsen launched for local kids and said it was ensuring the club stayed strong well after his involvement.
He laughed off critics who have derided the club for buying their way to the top part of the ladder and said Ingebrigtsen's commitment to team bonding between new and returning players was the reason for their success.
While Ingebrigtsen puts plenty of focus on culture at his own club, he is arguably the most travelled A-grade coach in the CDRL and can be found scouting his upcoming opposition at every opportunity.
He said it would be a "good little achievement" to bring up such a milestone in just three years of coaching, but was particularly thrilled to have done it at a place he had no prior contacts, far removed from his dad, Sunshine Coast Falcons coach Craig Ingebrigtsen.
"I've always wanted to do my own thing," Ingebrigtsen said.
"I don't like people saying I'm only here because of my dad. It has just been off my own bat and I'm hoping to make my own career and my own legacy."
