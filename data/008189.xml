  <title>Slain Vic man's pal denies drug knowledge</title>
  <content>
The best friend of murdered cannabis dealer James Russouw has told a Melbourne court he underwent a lie detector test following his mate's death in an attempt to prove he didn't know where drugs were coming from.
On Wednesday in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Simon Cupido denied knowing who Mr Russouw planned to buy a large quantity of cannabis from on the night of his killing in 2008, and also denied the pair had a "business-friendship" relationship.
Christopher Lavery, 31, is standing trial for the stabbing murder after which the victims's body was torched inside his Jeep.
