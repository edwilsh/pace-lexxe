  <title>Peak-hour nightmare on Sydney roads</title>
  <content>
PEOPLE should expect nightmare peak-hour commutes on the M5 motorway after an overheight truck struck the tunnel entrance of the M5 East.
Extreme delays are expected for those travelling towards the city this afternoon.
M5 East closed eastbound lanes but they have now been reopened, according to Live Traffic NSW. The truck was moved shortly after the incident.
The truck hit the tunnel entrance at Bexley North before 5.30pm and there is currently heavy traffic.
A detour to King Georges Road, Stoney Creek Road and Forest Road were put in place.
There has also been an accident in the M5 southbound lanes.
One of the three lanes closed.

All eastbound lanes of the M5 East are open as the overheight truck has been moved. Traffic is still heavy.
