  <title>Ultralight plane crash leaves flying instructor, student seriously hurt</title>
  <content>
A flying instructor and a student are seriously injured after an ultralight plane crashed during a training flight at Clyde North, south-east of Melbourne.
Emergency services were called to the scene at Pound Road and Hardys Road about 10:40am.
Peter Gibson from the Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) said the pilot managed to make a mayday call before the Bristell ultralight two-seater plane crashed.
Ambulance Victoria said one person was in a critical condition and a second person, a man in his 30s, was still trapped in the plane with neck, chest and back injuries.
The man who was trapped was in a serious but stable condition, Ambulance Victoria said.
Two air ambulance helicopters were sent to the scene.
The accident will be investigated by Recreational Aviation Australia, which will prepare a report for CASA.
