  <title>CHRISTIANS, PREPARE FOR PERSECUTION</title>
  <content>
CHRISTIANS, prepare for persecution. Open your eyes and choose stronger leaders for the dark days.  

I am not a Christian, but I am amazed that your bishops and ministers are not warning you of what is already breaking over your heads.

How mad that Queensland's Education Department can now warn schools against letting students praise Jesus in the playground. 

The department has put out reports telling state schools "to take appropriate action if aware that students participating in (religious instruction) are evangelising to students who do not participate".

It gives examples of what students must not say in the playground - such as "knowing about Jesus is a very important thing", or "God, please help us to use our knowledge to help others".
