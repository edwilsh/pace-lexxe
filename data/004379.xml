Creditors chase Salim Mehajer for $97 million

The property developer's lawyers say his companies only have $32,000 in the bank, as Mehajer tries to halt the appointment of administrators.

Police applied for an interim AVO against Mr Mehajer on behalf of his estranged wife , less than a year after the couple's lavish wedding in August 2015.

Mr Mehajer has previously denied his estranged wife requested the first AVO.
He told media outlets at the time the AVO was prompted after "alleged complaints by neighbours" and because "police seem to have nothing better to do".
Mr Mehajer is facing a string of legal battles in courts across the city, including  and a dispute with a liquidator who is seeking to claw back $700,000 for creditors of his failed company SM Project Developments.
The company was wound up in 2013 owing almost $900,000 to the Australian Taxation Office.
Sydney barrister David Stack appeared in the Supreme Court on Tuesday for liquidator Anthony Elkerton of Dean-Willcocks Advisory, who alleges Mr Mehajer entered into "unreasonable director-related transactions" with SM Projects.
Mr Stack told the court Mr Mehajer "substantially [depleted] the accounts of the company" when he had outstanding tax bills of more than $840,000.
"He used monies that were properly payable to the ATO," Mr Stack said.
The three-day hearing continues on Thursday.
