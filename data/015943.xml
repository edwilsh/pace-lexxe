  <title>Turnbull treats refugees as cattle: Greens</title>
  <content>
Malcolm Turnbull's leaked phone call with Donald Trump is proof the Australian government trades refugees like cattle, Greens immigration spokesman Nick McKim says.
A full transcript of the leaders' colourful January phone chat was published on Thursday, with the US president praising his Australian counterpart for being "worse than I am" when it came to refusing refugees.
It also shed light on a people-swap deal between the two countries.
Mr Turnbull tells Mr Trump the US can decide to accept 1000 or 100 refugees from Manus Island and Nauru, or none at all.
"This is is leaving well over a thousand people in a terrible limbo," Senator Nick McKim said in Hobart.
"The Australian people do not want to see other human beings treated like cattle and traded in the marketplace."
Mr McKim has called on the government to resettle refugees held on Manus Island and Nauru in Australia.
