The US rock band's latest album One More Light re-entered at No. 4 (it peaked at No. 3 earlier this year), while 2003's Meteora is at No.5.
In all 11 Linkin Park albums returned to the Top 100, with fans buying up what stock was left in stores, as well as downloading and streaming the music.
Sixteen Linkin Park songs are in this week's ARIA Top 100 singles chart, the highest being In the End at No. 10, with Numb at No. 18 and Heavy, What I've Done, Numb/Encore and One Step Closer all in the Top 50.
