  <title>No point wasting money on becoming a republic</title>
  <content>
IN HIS letter (Daily, July 31) Michael Henderson vents his spleen in favour of a republic, referring to monarchists as unpatriotic, a supposed absurdity of the Queen being the Head of State, his perception of the Union Jack on the flag being ugly and various other things.
Obviously, he is very unhappy living in this country with the system we have, the system we know and the system which works just fine.
It leaves one to wonder why he does not find somewhere else to live which more suits his agenda.
However, in his diatribe he fails to do what all republicans do.
That is to precisely elaborate on the positive difference to each and every ordinary Australian that becoming a republic would make, bearing in mind the many billions of dollars which would need to be spent in order to turn the country into a republic.
It is the differences a republic would supposedly make to ordinary Australians which we need to know in order to justify the massive expenditure which would be needed for something which is merely pie in the sky yet no one can or will elaborate on what those positive differences would be.
Bill Shorten obviously sees it as a bit of a vote-getting exercise but I believe most people believe the republic issue is of a very, very low priority and the many billions of dollars which would be wasted on it would be far better spent on important issues of which there are many.
To me, there would be absolutely no justification whatever for such massive waste of money and I find it hard to believe Australia could be so crazy as to spend that sort of money on pie in the sky.
