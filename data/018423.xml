TERRIGAL Avoca held off a fast-finishing Newcastle City to get home 9.14-68 to 9.11-65 at No.1 Sportsground on Saturday.

The Panthers, who wrapped up the minor premiership last week, looked set for an easy afternoon.

They kicked five goals in the opening term to lead 35-9. However, the Blues kicked into gear in the second quarter to cut the margin to 54-42.

The Panthers led by 14 at the final turn before another twist.

Nick Gill and Max Quinlan kicked a goal each for City to close the gap to 68-65 but the home side couldn't find a match winner.

Jack Lennon and Cameron Jones kicked three majors each as Cardiff wrapped up second spot with a resounding 15.9-99 to 5.6-36 victory over Nelson Bay at Hillsborough Oval.
The Hawks had to fight hard in the opening two quarters and went to the long break ahead 6.4-40 to 4.2-26. But they took control in the third, kicking five-goals-two to the Marlins' four behinds.

Warners Bay kept their slim finals hopes alive with a 10.11-71 to 10.5-65  victory over cellar dwellers Killarney Vale at Adelaide St.
Kayne Gibbs was the hero for the bulldogs, kicking a handful of majors included one in the dying stages to snatch the win.
