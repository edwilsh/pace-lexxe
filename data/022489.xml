  <title>'You never say never': Choco's sneaky hint</title>
  <content>
PORT Adelaide premiership coach and former Magpies goalkicker Mark Williams has indicated his interest in the Collingwood coaching role, should it become available at season's end.
Current Magpies coach Nathan Buckley is out of contract at season's end and is no certainty to keep his role for the 2018 season, despite Collingwood's mini turnaround over recent weeks.
Asked if he would consider putting his hand up for the role if Collingwood opts to part ways with Buckley, Williams told SEN's Afternoons program on Monday: "You never say never."
Williams, a former Collingwood captain and dual best and fairest winner, described the Magpies coaching role as "one of the dream jobs of the AFL".
"I have a great passion for football and coaching," Williams said.

"If an opportunity like that came along, you would certainly look at it because it is one of the dream jobs of the AFL."
As well as leading the Power to their inaugural premiership, Williams has also been a development coach at Richmond where he played an integral part in helping Dustin Martin grow into the superstar he is today.
Williams then left the Tigers to coach Ajax in the VAFA for this season.
