Is Netflix's selection not enough for you? Than you're in luck if you live in Los Angeles or New York City.

In July, LA's public library announced that it would provide streaming of hundreds of films including access to films from  for free if you had a card.

New York City publication  wanted to know if New Yorkers have this benefit, too - and they didn't.

But starting Friday, they will.

On August 4, anyone with a New York or Brooklyn Public Library card will have streaming access to hundreds of movies including films from The Criterion Collection. The Criterion Collection includes classic and contemporary films that are considered important including "The Royal Tenenbaums," "Mulholland Drive," "Do the Right Thing," and "Pan's Labyrinth." (It's not clear exactly which films from The Criterion Collection will be available, and the selection may change.)

If you live in LA or New York, it's a simple process to get started.

First, you need a library card if you don't have one already. Then create an account on the streaming site,  using your library card number. You can watch up to ten movies per month, you have a three-day limit on each movie, and you can watch on an array of devices.
