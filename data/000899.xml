  <title>SA court hears of 'sociopathic' killing</title>
  <content>
A Brisbane woman who killed her Adelaide grandfather went to his home wearing rubber gloves and armed with a knife, a court has heard.
Brittney Jade Dwyer, 19, has pleaded guilty to the murder of 81-year-old Robert Whitwell in August last year.
In sentencing submissions, the South Australian Supreme Court on Monday was told the killing was "almost sociopathic in style".
Prosecutor Jim Pearce also objected to the proposed tendering of a psychiatric report prepared about Dwyer because it raised issues that had not come out in any other material before the court, including Dwyer's police interview.
