Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull expects there will be fewer delays at Australian airports for travellers after authorities disrupted an aviation terror threat. ASIO has moved to restore the aviation threat level to what it was before the alleged plot to bring down a plane was uncovered.
Mr Turnbull on Thursday said enhanced security measures will continue at airports but will be modified to reduce delays.
The Prime Minister said travellers should expect to hear from airlines in the next 24 hours.
The arrive time for people catching a flight should be restored to what it was previously, an hour for domestic flights and two hours for international.
While there will be fewer flight delays, Mr Turnbull said it didn't mean people should become complacent.
"There is no room for complacency," Mr Turnbull told reporters.
"No room for set-and-forget at all."
