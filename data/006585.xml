A US Navy sailor  from the USS Stetham somewhere in the waters of the South China Sea, Defence News reported Tuesday.

The guided-missile destroyer reported a man overboard at around 9 a.m. local time,  to Military.com. US and Japanese ships are currently assisting in the search-and-rescue effort.

The search for a missing sailor is the third for the Navy since June. A sailor fell from the  on June 6 and was later presumed dead after an extensive search. Another from the USS Shiloh, thought to have fallen overboard and presumed dead just days after the previous incident,  to be hiding in the ship's engine room.

The Navy did not release the name of the Stetham sailor since recovery efforts are still underway.
