  <title>Crow Greenwood baskets contract extension</title>
  <content>
HUGH Greenwood's gamble to leave basketball to return to Australian football is paying off with a new deal at the Adelaide Football Club.
The 25-year-old midfield dynamo has extended his contract at West Lakes to include the 2018-19 AFL seasons.
Greenwood, who play in his first AFL Showdown on Sunday, turned his back on professional basketball with the NBL Perth Wildcats to seek his football dream through the ultra-successful Crows rookie system. He now has a long-term AFL career before him.
Greenwood on Friday not only revealed his eagerness to develop his AFL prospects, but gratitude to the Crows and recruiting chief Hamish Ogilvie for believing in his talent.

"I'm really excited to see what's going to happen over the next couple of years, and I'm very thankful as well," said Greenwood, who advanced his basketball in the US college system at New Mexico before returning to Australia to try football again.
"The (Adelaide) footy club has given me another opportunity," Greenwood said.
"It's a very positive environment and I think we're built for success.
"I feel very much at home here. I've really embraced the city and the club," added Greenwood who is a Tasmanian.
Greenwood was upgraded to Adelaide's AFL list to make his league debut against Brisbane at the Gabba on May 20. He has quickly made his reputation as a strong-willed and ball-winning midfielder.
