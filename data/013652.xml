  <title>Marco his words United's season starts Wednesday, says Kurz</title>

MARCO Kurz has made it very clear that Adelaide United must be totally switched on from Wednesday - not on October 8, when the Reds A-League season kicks off.
It dispels the notion that Kurz, 48, will use the FFA Cup round-of-32 clash against Newcastle Jets on August 9 at Marden as an experiment.
After the Reds last year were embarrassed in their first outing as reigning champion under Guillermo Amor - when Queensland minnow Redlands United caused arguably the biggest shock of Australia's knockout cup when United lost 2-1 - Kurz issued his side a stern warning.
"The season starts next Wednesday in the FFA Cup against Newcastle,'' Kurz said.
"We have a week and we need the time to work hard."
But Kurz agreed the A-League pre-season is far too long - given Germany's famous DFB Pokal Cup starts in nine days, a week before the Bundesliga season kicks off.
While the Bundesliga has a 91-day break between competitions this year, Adelaide will have 176 days between its first A-League match of the new season against Wellington away in October after a 2-2 draw with Western Sydney in its final game on April 15.
But Kurz watched his understrength side convincingly beat  on Wednesday at Marden and state League 1  last week without star signings Turkish international, Ersan Gulum and Senegalese Baba Diawara.
He doesn't expect the pair to feature from the start against the Jets in a clash which sees Ernie Merrick return to Adelaide for the first time since he shocked the A-League by unexpectedly quitting Phoenix after a 2-0 loss to the Reds on December 4, 2016.
Merrick's replenished Jets have played four warm-up games, losing to Central Coast Mariners (2-0) and beating NSW NPL opponents Weston Bears (2-0), Broadmeadow Magic (5-1) and Maitland FC (4-0) on Wednesday.
With Adelaide expected to soon announce two foreigners - a winger and an attacking midfielder - plus two more Australian players to join ex-Wellington midfielder Vince Lia who was confirmed by the club as a done deal, Kurz says his fit stock must deliver a win.
"When you play an FFA Cup game, we will win,'' Kurz said.
"We will be prepared for Newcastle, we know what they will do."
Kurz has had 19 games' experience as a DFB Pokal Cup coach, winning 14 matches.
He led Kaiserslautern and TSV 1860 Munich to the quarter-finals of the tournament.
Kurz's sides were knocked out respectively by MSV Duisburg, which made it to the 2011 final, and Bayern Munich, which won the final in 2008.
