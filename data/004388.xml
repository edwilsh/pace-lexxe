  <title>Cops hunt down teens over alleged carjacking</title>
  <content>
FOUR teens and a 12-year-old have been arrested almost 700 km away from an alleged carjacking in Caulfield, following a police pursuit.
Police said two girls and three boys, aged from 12 to 15, were involved in the pursuit, which ended when a 2012 Toyota Camry crashed at Goulburn, New South Wales, at 9am last Friday.
The 36-year-old owner had bought the car from a Caulfield buyer just hours before he was threatened by a teenager with a bottle about 5.45pm the night before.
The Doveton victim had left VicRoads to return the transfer papers to the previous owner in Bond St, Caulfield, when he was attacked and his new car was stolen.
Police believe the five suspects were also linked to the theft of a bike from an elderly disabled man at Caulfield Railway Station at 5.30pm the same evening.
Police said a 15-year-old Thomastown male was remanded in custody.
The car wasn't insured.
