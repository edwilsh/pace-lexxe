  <title>Lotto luck strikes Perth three times</title>
  <content>
SIX winning Saturday Lotto tickets have been sold across the country - and three lucky West Australians are sharing in the spoils.
The share of the jackpot being divided among six winners around Australia is $719,408.
After no winning tickets were sold in Perth last week, lotto players have made up for it with three tickets having the correct numbers.
The Lucky Charm lived up to its name - twice. Winning tickets were sold at its Atwell and East Victoria Park outlets.
The other lucky ticket was sold at the Kwinana Hub L/C & News outlet in Kwinana.
Saturday's winning numbers were: 21, 7, 20, 1, 11, 32 and the supps: 26, 22.
