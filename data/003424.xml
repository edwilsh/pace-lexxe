  <title>Crash sees highway grind to a halt</title>
  <content>
A TWO-VEHICLE crash on the Bruce Hwy has left the road in gridlock as peak hour traffic grinds to a halt.
Paramedics had arrived at the scene of the crash by about 8am, the  reports.
The incident happened just north of the Caloundra Rd interchange in the southbound lanes.
All occupants in the crash were out of their vehicles and paramedics were assessing patients.
The banked traffic spanned about 5km at 8.15am, with the highway heavily affected in the southbound lanes as far away as the Sunshine Mwy interchange.
