  <title>Bitcoin's value just went nuts</title>
  <content>
Bitcoin shot up to a new record high in weekend trade, reaching a new high of $US3,360.

investor relief is driving the latest rally, as this week's split in the currency proved to be relatively uneventful.

A short time ago, Bitcoin was holding its recent gains above $US3,250.

Following a fork in the currency last week which created two separate versions of Bitcoin, the alternative Bitcoin Cash looks to be rapidly falling in popularity.

Bitcoin Cash prices have slipped from $US765 at the time of the fork to below $US250 over the weekend,

The world's second-biggest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has also seen strong demand over the weekend.

The price of Ether tokens is now moving back towards $US300 after falling as low at $US150 in mid-July.
