  <title>Free shot at Perfect 9's $200,000</title>
  <content>
WANT a free shot to win $200,000? Here's your chance with our Perfect 9 jackpot now $200,000 for Round 20.
It's free to play. All you need to do is sign-up, select nine players - one from each AFL match - and if they each top score in SuperCoach ... cha ching! It's just like bingo.
Anyone can play, you don't need to be a SuperCoach to play. So just sign-up and have a crack at the cash!

This season we've had several players land five out of nine so it's just a matter of time before the JACKPOT goes off. It might as well be you!
Perfect 9 is the perfect partner for SuperCoach Classic. If you are you a commitment-phobe or don't have the patience for a full SuperCoach season, then Perfect 9 is the best option for you (aside from Tipping).
If no-one lands 9-9, the prize jackpots $5000 (except bye rounds).
That's some serious cash for fantasy footy!
