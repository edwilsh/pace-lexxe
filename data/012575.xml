FOR those who've never been to This is Not Art, its organisers say this year is the perfect introduction.
In its 20th year, the Newcastle festival of writing, performance, visual art and critical thinking will sprawl across 20 venues and four days, starting September 28.

The full program will be announced later this month, and will include a "Spelling Bee for Adults", "Fake News game show", and "What the Spewcastle?!", an artistic take on urban Newcastle.
"We really want people who haven't been to the festival before to come along and be inspired," festival producer Christina Robberds said.

"There will be more than 150 sessions and they're all free. This is such a valuable opportunity for people to experience the joy of the performance, writing, and interactive art installations right here in Newcastle."
The festival is on Facebook, and on Twitter and Instagram @thisisnotart
