  <title>Philippine troops kill town mayor in drug war</title>
  <content>
Police in the southern Philippines killed 15 people, including a city mayor, days after president Rodrigo Duterte ordered them to escalate a deadly crackdown on drugs that has left thousands of Filipinos dead.
The early morning assault on three homes linked to Reynaldo Parojinog in the port city of Ozamiz, on Mindanao island, was the bloodiest assault yet in the crackdown that has been condemned by the United States, United Nations and human rights groups.

Philippines declares martial law on Mindanao island

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte declares martial law on the island of Mindanao after deadly clashes between militants and troops.

Senate opposition leader Franklin Drilon questioned the circumstances of the attack on Parojinog's home and pointed out that the deaths of two other mayors were subsequently found to be "rub-outs."
But Ozamiz police chief Jovie Espenido told Associated Press that police with a warrant went to the houses "to enforce the law to protect people who want peace in the country."

"How can we enforce the law if we are... scared of the drugs lords?
"He's a high-value target on illegal drugs," he said, adding that firearms and suspected drugs were seized. 

Parojinog, who was facing corruption charges, denied any link to the drugs trade after his family was named by Mr Duterte in a list of local government officials he ordered to be targeted.

Parojinog's daughter Nova Parojinog Echavez, the city's vice-mayor who was arrested, told reporters that no-one from their side fired a weapon.
 "I am asking president Durtere to investigate this (as well as) the Senate of the Philippines," she said, adding she feared for her life.Photo: Supplied
Asked what message she had for Mr Durtere she said "look at this closely. He knows my father. He knows my father."
Last year police shot dead a mayor in a cell on Leyte island and another mayor and nine of his bodyguards were killed allegedly during a fire-fight in the southern Philippines.
Investigations by the National Bureau of Investigation and a Senate panel recommended charges be laid against the police involved in the killings.
