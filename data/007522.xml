  <title>Sydney chase ends with 'failed carjacking'</title>
  <content>
A man is facing a string of charges after allegedly leading police on a wild car chase which ended with an attempted carjacking in Sydney's west.
The 28-year-old was driving a car stolen from a home in Colyton on Monday when officers spotted him in the nearby suburb of Wilmot on Tuesday afternoon.
Officers unsuccessfully used road spikes to stop the driver during a pursuit, which began after he refused to pull over.
A police helicopter tracked the car on the M7 to Blacktown, but lost sight of the suspect when he drove into an underground car park on Stephen Street.
Police allege the driver tried to steal a car from a 63-year-old woman before running into the street where he was finally arrested.
He was taken to Blacktown Hospital for non-life threatening injuries and later charged.
The man was refused bail and is due to appear at Blacktown Local Court on Wednesday.
