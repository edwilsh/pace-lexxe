  <title>Unbreakable review: Jane Caro and the challenges women face every day</title>
  <content>
Unbreakable
Ed., Jane Caro
UQP, $29.95
From being raped at knife-point to being inappropriately propositioned, these striking stories from prominent women cover the spectrum of challenges women face every day. In the past, women were expected to put up and shut up. When her breast was groped, Polly Dunning was told to "get over yourself" for telling the groper to stop. A recurring theme is the surreal disparity between women's sense of their own autonomy and some men's childish disregard for it, as if they are eternally entitled to the mother's breast. These stories also highlight how hard men find it to put themselves in women's shoes - such is our culture's abhorrence of effeminisation, as Nina Funnell explores. A lot of women will find their own experiences mirrored in Unbreakable. But this is also a book for men, or at least those game enough to confront the "inconvenient truths" of women's lives.
