The Newcastle Jets are "back to square one" in their search for a marquee player after missing out on the South American midfielder they had in their sights.

Jets chief executive Lawrie McKinna confirmed on Thursday that the deal had fallen over after a member of the player's family developed health issues.

"It's back to the drawing board," he said. "His pedigree was good. We were quite happy with it. Now we'll just start looking again."
McKinna confirmed the South American would have been a marquee player outside the club's salary cap had he signed.
The Jets have two vacancies on their roster after signing former Central Coast Mariners defender Jake Adelson last week on a two-year contract. One spot has been earmarked for a creative midfielder and the other for a Chinese player. 
Chinese triallist Zhu Zhengyu scored a goal and won a penalty in Wednesday night's 4-0 trial win over Maitland but has not done enough to impress coach Ernie Merrick and will return home.

McKinna said the Jets, who face Adelaide away from home on Wednesday in the FFA Cup, would keep working with owner Martin Lee's company and agents in China to find the right player.  
"We've been given some CVs and we've checked them out and they're not up to it. Nothing on the cards at the moment," he said. "There's one in the pipeline, but not for another week or so. 

"Martin knows that if the boys aren't good enough, they're not good enough.

"It's just very, very hard now getting Chinese players who are good enough.

"Guanghzhou Evergrande have got like 53 players in their reserve team. Only 18 go at the weekend, then they've got a full coaching staff to train the other boys while they're away, so it basically stops other teams signing the boys."

McKinna returned from China on Wednesday with a Jets under-18 squad after they finished last at the Weifang Cup in China.

The young Jets were third in their group after beating hosts Shandong Luneng 3-1, losing 3-0 to Mexico's Chivas Guadalajara and drawing 2-2 with Belgium's Club Brugge.

They lost their first play-off game 3-0 to the Chinese national under-19 side then went down 3-2 to Tokyo FC in the seventh-place play-off.
