  <title>178 migrants rescued from trailer in Mexico</title>
  <content>
Mexican officials on Sunday were attempting to return almost 200 Central American migrants to their home countries after they escaped an abandoned trailer.
The migrants were found Saturday in a trailer in Veracruz state, about 640 km from the US border, Mexico's National Institute of Migration said. The rescue came a week after 10 undocumented immigrants died in a packed, overheated trailer in San Antonio, Texas.Photo: Bloomberg
Officials told AFP news service the 178 occupants of the truck Saturday apparently realised they had been abandoned by the traffickers and a few escaped, seeking help from local residents who provided food and water.
The Central Americans were shuttled to a migration centre for medical assistance before the process began to return them to their home countries, the migration agency said.

No arrests were immediately reported.
In the San Antonio case, a Florida trucker is facing charges that could bring the death penalty. James Mathew Bradley Jr., 60, told police he was unaware of the human cargo packed in his rig.

But one passenger told authorities about 100 people stuffed in the trailer Bradley was hauling took turns breathing through a hole in the wall. More than two dozen survivors were rushed to hospitals, some in critical condition.

"These smugglers have no regard for human life and seek only profits," Kelly said.
