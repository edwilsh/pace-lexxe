  <title>ICAC Operation Credo finds Obeid, Tripodi, Kelly engaged in corrupt conduct</title>
  <content>
Former Labor ministers Eddie Obeid Snr, Joe Tripodi and Tony Kelly engaged in serious corrupt conduct, the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) has found.
The finding was released in Sydney this morning, and made as part of the ICAC's investigation into Australian Water Holdings, dubbed Operation Credo.
Political staffer Gilbert "Laurie" Brown was also found to have engaged in serious corrupt conduct.
ICAC recommended the Director of Public Prosecutions consider charging the four men with misconduct in public office, which is a criminal offence.
Obeid is currently serving a prison sentence for misconduct in public office arising from the commission's investigation into his family's secret business dealings at Circular Quay.
He has also been committed to stand trial alongside his son Moses Obeid for conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office following the commission's investigation into the granting of coal exploration licences in the Bylong Valley.
More to come.
