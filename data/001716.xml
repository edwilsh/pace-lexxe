  <title>Cyclist-hater spills oil on bike paths</title>
  <content>
A CYCLIST-hating assailant is suspected of deliberately pouring oil over city bike paths and causing riders to crash.
The Dynon Road path, especially between Dynon Rd and Arden Rd, and Capital City Trail have both been targeted over the past three weeks.
Oil has been spilt over the paths on each occasion.
Victoria Police spokeswoman Natalie Savino said: "The incidents are believed to be deliberate acts, with the latest occurring overnight."
"The dangerous spills have caused cyclists to lose traction and control of their bikes,'' Ms Savino said.
"All cyclists are urged to take care while riding."
Police have been told one rider required medical attention after falling as a result of the oil.
They today called on the injured cyclist to phone Melbourne North Police Station on (03) 8379 0800.
Anyone with information or who may have witnessed any suspicious activity in the area is urged to contact Crime Stoppers via 1800 333 000 or .
