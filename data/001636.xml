  <title>This is the most popular name for Australian cats and dogs</title>

What's in a name?

Move aside Rover and Fluffy - Bella is the most popular name for both cats and dogs, according to a new survey of the monikers we're giving our furry friends.
The finding comes courtesy of rent.com.au's 30,000 strong database of pets, which, along with cats and dogs, also includes rabbits, lizards and fish. 
When it comes to the dogs in our lives, Buddy and Charlie come in second and third place, with Max, Missy and Molly also making the cut.

Interestingly, our felines are also being called Buddy and Charlie, as well as Smokey, Oscar, and Coco.

If you've got rabbits, chances are you're a stickler for tradition. Bugs comes in first place, followed by the very creative Bunny, as well as Bugsy and Benjamin.
If you ignore the fact that the most common name for a person's pet fish is "Fish", and the 10th ranked name is "Fish Fish" the monikers in between are a tad more inspiring/original.There's Bruce, Nigel, Whitey, Rainbow - and even Sashimi.

Sashimi isn't the only food-inspired name, however. Lolly, Bubbles, Cola, Skittles, Gin, Oreo, VB and Nugget are all monikers we're using for our animals.
The survey also revealed that dogs are overwhelming a man woman and child's best friend (making up 68 per cent of pets), followed by cats at 24 per cent.
And the least popular pet? Spiders - thank goodness.
