  <content>
A 27-year-old Meadowbrook man has been charged with a range of drug offences after a police raid on a house in Edenlea Drive on Wednesday.
Detectives from the Logan District Criminal Investigation Branch and officers from the Logan Central Operations Team reported to have uncovered a "nonactive clandestine drug laboratory" along with some dangerous drugs.
They said they found items used to produce methylamphetamine along with a firearm and a quantity of unlawful dangerous drugs in a car at the address.
A man was taken to the Beenleigh Watchhouse where he was charged for producing dangerous drugs and other drug-related offences.
He was expected to appear in the Beenleigh Magistrates Court on Thursday.
Investigations are continuing.
