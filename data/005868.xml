  <title>Venezuela security agents seize opposition leaders from homes in night-time raids</title>
  <content>
Footage has emerged of Venezuelan security officials seizing two opposition leaders from their homes in overnight raids, after they urged .

Key points:

The two opposition leaders were picked up on the same night
They were both already under house arrest
The move follows controversial elections held over the weekend

Leopoldo Lopez and Antonio Ledezma were both under house arrest, the former for his role in leading street protests against President Nicolas Maduro in 2014 and the latter on charges of plotting a coup.
"12:27 in the morning: the moment when the dictatorship kidnaps Leopoldo at my house," Mr Lopez's wife Lilian Tintori wrote on Twitter.
She posted a link to a video that appeared to show Mr Lopez being led into a vehicle emblazoned with the word Sebin, Venezuela's intelligence agency.

The Information Ministry did not immediately respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment.
Mr Lopez and Mr Ledezma are both former mayors in the capital Caracas, and high-profile critics of Mr Maduro.
They had called on Venezuelans to join protests over Sunday's election of the constituent assembly, which supersedes an opposition-controlled congress that a pro-Maduro Supreme Court had already stripped of its powers.
At least 10 people were killed in unrest during the vote, which was boycotted by the opposition and .
Vanessa Ledezma said she held Mr Maduro responsible for what happened to her father.

"The Sebin just took him," she wrote on Twitter, posting a video of intelligence agents taking Mr Ledezma, who was dressed in pyjamas.
He was granted house arrest in 2015 after being imprisoned on charges of leading a coup against Mr Maduro.
following three years in prison for his role in anti-government street protests in 2014.
His release was considered a major breakthrough in the country's political standoff.
Mr Lopez's lawyer, Juan Gutierrez, wrote on Twitter that "there is no legal justification to revoke the house arrest measure."
Maduro remains defiant

Despite growing international criticism, Mr Maduro has said he has no intention of deviating from his plans to rewrite the constitution.
The besieged leader sees his enemies as being part of an international conspiracy against him, led by the man he calls "Emperor Donald Trump."
"They don't intimidate me. The threats and sanctions of the empire don't intimidate me for a moment," Mr Maduro said on national television.

"I don't listen to orders from the empire, not now or ever ... Bring on more sanctions, Donald Trump."
, escalating a tactic that has so far failed to alter his socialist government's behaviour.
For now, the Trump administration has not delivered on threats to sanction Venezuela's oil industry, which could undermine Mr Maduro's government but raise US gas prices.
The sanctions came after electoral authorities said more than 8 million people voted to create the constitutional assembly, a turnout doubted by independent analysts.
The election has been labelled illegitimate by leaders across the Americas and Europe.
