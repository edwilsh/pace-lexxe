  <title>Man charged over Sydney pedestrian's death</title>
  <content>
A man has been charged after an elderly pedestrian was struck and killed in Sydney last month.
The 74-year-old woman was struck by a van at a pedestrian crossing at Chatswood early on July 13 and died five days later in hospital, police say.
On Sunday, a 43-year-old man was issued with a future court attendance notice for several offences, including dangerous driving occasioning death and failing to give way to a pedestrian.
He's due to appear before Hornsby Local Court on October 5.
