Gateway Hotel hits market

exit

ISLINGTON's Gateway Hotel is on the market for the first time in almost 20 years. 
The hotel, which carries a 5am licence, sits on a 778 square metre site near the corner of Beaumont Street and Maitland Road. 
The hotel also houses the Small Ballroom, which regularly hosts Australian and international music acts. 

Sydney agents Manenti Quinlan and Associates, as well as Moore and Moore Real Estate, are selling the popular venue. 
"The hotel has been generally used as a 'weekender' by the current owners and would benefit from a keen and motivated operator," the agents said in a statement. 
The sale is by expressions of interest which close on Thursday September 7. 

The Newcastle Herald reported a dispute between sacked drag performers and management in January had led to calls for the venue to lose its status as a list of safe venues for Newcastle's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities.

Management argued they had cut the drag shows due to the quality of the shows.
