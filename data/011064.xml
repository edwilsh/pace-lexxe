  <title>Melbourne train sparks caught on camera as passengers evacuate</title>
  <content>
Passengers have been taken off two Melbourne trains after electrical sparks were seen shooting from the roof of a carriage on the suburban network in the inner city.
Metro Trains said a problem with wires caused sparking above a train heading out of the city about 7:25am, and about 30 passengers were escorted off the train just after 8:00am.
The train was stopped between Richmond and Flinders Street stations.
A second train heading towards the city then lost power between the two stations.
A Metro spokeswoman said at no time were passengers at risk and the train did not catch fire.
About 300 passengers were escorted off the second train in between the stations, Metro said.
The incident was causing delays of about 30 minutes.
