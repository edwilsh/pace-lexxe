  <title>'Embarrassed' Canberra Raiders to make amends against Cronulla Sharks</title>
  <content>
Embarrassment still burns from a Shark attack on their home patch and it's fuelling the Canberra Raiders ahead of their must-win clash at Cronulla on Saturday night.
Raiders attack coach Mick Crawley also revealed they'd return to their usual set-up with England international Josh Hodgson starting at hooker against the Cronulla Sharks.

Canberra keep slim finals hopes alive

The Raiders claimed a solid 32-18 victory over South Sydney.

Crawley said they'd spoken about their 42-16 loss to the Sharks at Canberra Stadium in round two, when they were completely overrun by a rampant Cronulla who scored five tries in succession in the second half.
Going into the rematch, Canberra sits two wins outside the eight and needs to win all five of their remaining games to have a chance of making the NRL finals.

Helping their cause is , along with the fact the Sharks have struggled at Shark Park in 2017.
Crawley hoped it would work in their favour as they headed to the Shire on Thursday to get ready for the game.

He said aggression was the key in taking on a Sharks team containing Andrew Fifita and Paul Gallen in their forward pack.

"They're an aggressive side and you've got to match their aggression otherwise they'll beat you," Crawley said.
"We're going up there with no false ideas of what's ahead us - it's going to be a tough game.
"[Aggression is the key] - it is every week in the forwards. They've got to do their job and the big boys know that.
"When we played them down here earlier in the year they embarrassed us a little bit in front of our home fans.
"They got over the top of us in the middle of the field and we want to rectify that this week.
"It's a test, they're up against the premiers this week and we know what they bring so we'll have to be ready for it."
Hodgson has started at lock the last two games, with Kurt Baptiste running on at hooker, but Crawley said that was just to help cover the suspensions of Josh Papalii and Sia Soliola.
It's a tactic the Raiders have previously employed later in games, allowing them extra ball-playing ability in the middle of the park when Baptiste came off the bench.
With Papalii returning to the second row after a two-week break for a shoulder charge, Crawley said Hodgson would also return to his usual starting role at dummy half.
It also allows the Raiders to another big body in the middle of the park, with Luke Bateman or Joe Tapine at lock, given the powerful Cronulla forwards.
"It was more about Sia and Pap both being out and giving us a bit more stability on the field," Crawley said.
"Hodgo will be back to nine this week. It's something we can use, depending on who we're playing, but we think this week going with the bigger pack will work for us."
Crawley was confident the NRL's guidelines were strict enough to protect players in the wake of Cronulla clearing hooker Fa'amanu Brown to face the Raiders.
Brown passed all the concussion protocols after he was knocked unconscious by an accidental knee to the head from New Zealand prop Sam Lisone.
Crawley spoke to the Raiders doctor following revelations Melbourne fullback Billy Slater lost two weeks' memory after he was knocked out and was confident the NRL's protocols were sufficient.
"The processes are very tough. The boys have to work very hard to get back, they have to prove that they're right," he said.
"They don't train early in the week and then they go through all the scans and that again at the end of the week. I'm sure it's very good."
