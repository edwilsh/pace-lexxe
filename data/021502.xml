  <title>An Adelaide couple just spent $260,000 on an amazing present for their grandkids - a full set of 62 vintages of Grange</title>
  <content>
A complete set of Australia's most famous wine, Penfolds Bin 95 Grange - all 62 bottles from the first experimental vintage by Max Schubert in 1951, to the 2012 edition, sold in Adelaide for the bargain price of $230,000 yesterday.

With buyer's premium the total cost is $260,000, but given the price estimate was $250,000 and $280,000, and a man in Melbourne, the Adelaide couple who bought the set got a bargain, especially when a single bottle of '51 sold last month for $51,750. Around 20 bottles of that first year are still estimated to be in existence. It was not released commercially and Schubert gave away all the wine, in hand-blown bottles, to friends for free.

So if you calculate the couple saved $40,000 on the set, that's enough to buy another two cases of the current $850 2012 vintage.

Auctioneer Marc du Plessis said around five bidders were after the collection and the winning bidders bought it as an investment for their grandchildren.
