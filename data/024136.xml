Guard pleads not guilty in alleged bugging case

Adrian Gard faced court over allegations he lied about finding a listening device in the All Blacks hotel room in 2016. Vision: Seven News.

Mr Gard has pleaded not guilty to making up claims about finding the bug secreted in a chair in the team's meeting room last August.
Mr Shand told the court Mr Gard, who has pleaded not guilty to making a false representation resulting in a police investigation into the bug, had worked as a security guard for the All Blacks since about 2005.

He said Mr Gard's role during the All Blacks' stay in the lead-up to the Bledisloe Cup match against Australia on August 20, 2016, was to ensure security for the players at the InterContinental hotel in Double Bay and when they trained at North Sydney Oval.
Mr Shand said Mr Gard had carried out bug sweeps for the team in the past but the team manager decided they needed a new contractor to do the job as they were staying in Sydney for a week, instead of the usual two or three days.

Mr Shand said that, given the sophisticated listening devices available on the market, he thought if they were going to sweep for bugs they should do the job "thoroughly and properly".

Mr Shand said that, when he entered Mr Gard's hotel room, he saw two conference chairs taken from the team's meeting room.

Material from one chair had been cut back and Mr Shand could see what looked like a battery and some wires.
Mr Shand remembered asking, "What is that?" before both men stared at the bug in "shock", coming to the realisation it was a listening device.
"It's not something I'd ever seen before," Mr Shand told the court.
"I think both of us were shocked a bug sweep had potentially found this."
The hearing continues.
