Wollongong-based triathlete Ashleigh Gentle has stunned her rivals and herself by winning the WTS series race in Montreal on Sunday (AEST). 
Gentle only decided to compete hours before the start after feeling sick in the lead-up. Part of a group of 13 into the final transition, Gentle gained a vital break on pre-race favourite, Bermuda's Flora Duffy. 
She was never headed, claiming victory by 23 seconds, with Duffy  second and New Zealand Andrea Hewitt third. Fellow Wollongong-based athlete Charlotte McShane was 10th. 

"I've got to say a huge thanks to my coach Jamie Turner who installed some things in my mind to just focus on the little things and the inspiration from Gwen (Jorgensen)," Gentle said.

"I'm in shock really...I can't believe it. I had my first WTS start in the London test event in 2011 so it's been six long years of ups and downs, five silver medals and finally I've had a win...that was a tough race for me."
