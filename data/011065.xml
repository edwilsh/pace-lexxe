  <title>ASX to open higher, Australian trade in focus, Wall St closes mixed</title>
  <content>
Australian shares are headed for a slightly higher open despite weak leads from overseas equity markets.

Market snapshot at 7:30am (AEST):

ASX SPI 200 futures +0.2pc at 5,692, ASX 200 (Wednesday close) -0.5pc at 5,744
AUD: 79.65 US cents, 60.21 British pence, 67.16 euro cents, 88.17 Japanese yen, NZ$1.07
US: Dow Jones +0.24pc at 22,016, S&P 500 flat at 2,478, Nasdaq flat at 6,363
Europe: FTSE -0.2pc at 7,411,  DAX -0.6pc at 12,181, Eurostoxx50 -0.5pc at 3,459
Commodities: Brent crude -1.1pc at $US52.35/barrel, spot gold -0.2pc at $US1,266/ounce, iron ore -1.7pc at $US72.30/tonne

In local futures trade, the ASX SPI 200 index was up by one-fifth of a per cent.
This is also the first week of August profit reporting season, and the next big Australian company to announce its results is Suncorp.
"2016-17 profits for the market as a whole are likely to have increased by around 18 per cent, driven by a huge 135 per cent gain in resources profits on the back of the rebound in commodity prices," said Dr Shane Oliver, chief economist of AMP Capital.
"Profit growth for the rest of the market is likely to be around 5.5 per cent led by retailers, utilities, healthcare stocks and financials."
In economic news, the highlight will be the June trade balance figures, released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
These figures cover the difference in value between Australia's imports and exports to other nations.
A narrower surplus of $1.8 billion is expected by economists polled by Reuters - compared to the May surplus of $2.47 billion.
Also out today are New Zealand's monthly job advertisements data, and service sector PMI (purchasing managers index) reports from Australia, China and Japan.
What happened on Wall St?

Wall Street put in a mixed performance this morning.
The Dow Jones hit a fresh record, but the Nasdaq and S&P 500 finished flat.
Half the US sectors posted gains - led by utilities and technology, while telecommunications and health care lagged behind.
The star performer was Apple, which experienced a 5 per cent jump in its share price that helped push the Dow past the 22,000 points milestone.
This was a market reaction to the earnings results that the tech giant posted in after-hours trade on Tuesday.
Essentially, Apple's quarterly revenue was $US45.5 billion ($57.1 billion), which exceeded the market's expectations by about half a billion US dollars.
Though the other tech giants - Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet - ended the day with trading losses, which weighed down the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.
The technology sector has been the strongest performing sector in the year to date.
In regards to US economic releases, investors also digested job figures from ADP and Moody's Analytics.
The data revealed that private US companies added 178,000 jobs last month, which fell below expectations (as economists polled by Reuters were expecting 185,000 new jobs to be created).
