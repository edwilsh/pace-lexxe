  <title>Airline worker struck by lightning on Florida runway</title>
  <content>
Video has emerged of the terrifying moment an airport worker was struck by lightning on a runway in Florida.
Austin Dunn, 21, was working under the right wing of a Sun Country plane at Southwest Florida International Airport when lightning struck the aircraft's tail on July 22, NBC2 reports.
CCTV shows the bolt of lightning running down the aircraft before it struck Mr Dunn in the hand.
The shock caused the airline worker to collapse on the ground before co-workers frantically ran to his aid.
Mr Dunn was taken to hospital suffering third-degree burns to his body where he remained under care for two weeks, NBC2 reports.
His family have said on Facebook he has "severe muscle damage" and a "long road" of nerve-damage treatment ahead.
Airport officials reportedly said the lightning warning system was activated at the time of the incident.
