  <content>
TWO female pedestrians have been hit by vehicles in separate incidents in Townsville, leaving one in a critical condition.
A 34-year-old was walking inbound along Bayswater Rd, Mount Louisa, about 7 o'clock last night with a male friend when she was hit by a four-wheel-drive approaching a roundabout.
The woman was taken to Townsville Hospital with critical injuries. Her friend was uninjured.
The Forensic Crash Unit was investigating.
And a girl, believed to be 13, was transported to Townsville Hospital with minor injuries after she was hit by a car outside the Stockland shopping centre at Aitkenvale about 9pm.
A Queensland Ambulance spokeswoman said the patient was up and walking but was taken to hospital as a precaution.
