  <title>Ram Trucks Recalled Over Occupant Safety</title>
  <content>
, the Australian firm responsible for importing and converting the  pickup truck range in Australia, has issued a recall relating to occupant safety for the 1500, 2500, and 3500 model lines.
The recall relates to the Occupant Restraint Module, which may activate a diagnostic trouble code restricting the vehicle's ability to detect a rollover situation. This will result in airbags failing to deploy during a rollover, increasing the risk of passenger injury.
Just six vehicles are affected by the recall action, with American Special Vehicles urging owners to contact their authorised Ram Truck dealer to arrange an inspection and reprogramming of the module.
