AUSTRALIAN football icon Les Murray has died aged 71.
The legendary commentator and broadcaster was for so long the face of football in this country as a fixture on SBS.
CEO and managing director of SBS Michael Ebeid was quick to pay tribute to his "dear friend".
Devastated at the news that our dear friend & colleague Les Murray has passed away. A great Australian who really has left a great legacy.
More to come ...
