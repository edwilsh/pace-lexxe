  <title>Last orders for St Kilda's deli king</title>
  <content>
ST KILDA'S deli king is hanging up his meat cleaver for the final time on Saturday.
For the past 41 years, Gruners Butcher owner Peter Gruner, 76, has dished up delicacies in Barkly St.
But August 5 will be his last day behind the counter of the shop his parents started nearly 60 years ago.
Speaking to the Leader ahead of his retirement, Mr Gruner said calling last orders on his life as a butcher was bittersweet.
"It's like a celebration and a funeral together," he said.
Mr Gruner said when the now famous St Kilda butcher and deli opened in 1958 there were 15 other continental butchers in nearby streets and competition was fierce.
He thinks his is one of the last still there.
Mr Gruner said he would spend his retirement "catching up on my sleep" and travelling with his wife Lee, a doctor.
"She is a very bright lady," he said.
"She was president of the Royal Australian College of Medical Administrators and she teaches in hospitals around the world; in Myanmar, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Indonesia.
"She will do all that and I will carry her bags and go to the gym to freshen up my body."
Mr Gruner said the business would be transferred to chef and restaurateur Andrew McConnell and butcher Troy Wheeler, who plan to rebrand it as the second branch of their gourmet Fitzroy butchery, Meatsmith.
