  <title>Primary school teacher sat down with 45 pedophiles to watch live stream of six-year-old being raped</title>
  <content>
A PRIMARY school teacher who watched a live stream of a six-year-old boy being raped has received 20 months jail. 

The  reports Wayne Brookes, 43, was sentenced in Bristol Crown Court, in the UK, on Tuesday. 

Brooks and 45 other pedophiles were given a ten digit code which they used to log in to the live stream that showed William Chandler Augusta, of Pennsylvannia in the US, raping the young boy.

, in the UK, reports Augusta was detected by Canadian authorities and arrested in February. 

Subsequent investigations led to the arrest of four men in England. 

Two of those - Wayne Brooks and 44-year-old Darren Williams - had jobs where they worked with children. 

Williams was later sentenced to 11 years jail for his part in the rape which took place in July 2015 - with the court hearing he instructed the rapist to  "put the sound on" and to "prove it's live" by "smacking" the victim and making him "say hi".

The court also heard Williams sent messages telling chat room users the rape was about to be streamed and encouraging them to join him in watching it.

Williams was employed as a youth worker when the allegations surfaced.

Colin Radcliffe, operations manager at the NCA's child exploitation and online protection (CEOP) command, said: "Darren Williams drove children to activities where they would play sport and have fun together.

"As it's clear that he believes children can be horrifically abused for his pleasure his arrest was a vital intervention.

"These men thought they'd found a corner of the internet where they could avoid the consequences of participating in abuse.

"They were wrong and others like them should know NCA officers have skills and tools that mean no one seeking to harm children is safe from the law.

"Protecting children is an integral part of the NCA's mission and our officers are dedicated to ensuring people like these are brought to justice."

The two other men detected by UK authorities are still awaiting sentencing.
