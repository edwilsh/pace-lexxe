Last year Fairfax Media reported local schools had crowded around a tiny 360-degree camera to record a music video like no other. The final project is now live.
The Hatchman Drum Corp's, made up of hundreds of students from across the Hunter, recorded a video in which the audience, with the aid of virtual reality goggles, can watch from every angle. 

Mr Hatchman said the experience was totally immersive and a showcase of his dedicated students' abilities.
"The kids did really well," he said.
"It's always hard to describe a rock concert, to get across that experience in words. When you're there you can feel it.

- Col Hatchman
"But you feel like you're in the room with these kids when you watch this video."
Four schools participated in the video, Bolwarra, Hinton, Morpeth and Vacy primary schools. 
The students piled into town halls and rehearsed drumming on buckets through the year.
