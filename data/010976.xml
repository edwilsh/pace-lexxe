  <content>
FOOTBALL: Lionel Messi bid farewell to Neymar on Instagram after the Brazilian striker told him and other Barcelona teammates he was leaving, saying it was a "huge pleasure" to have played with him.
The Catalan club confirmed that Neymar wanted to leave after weeks of intense speculation, taking the 25-year-old closer to a potential $329m world record move to Paris Saint-Germain.
The total value of the deal is worth nearly $AUD747m, which includes wages, bonuses and a buyout clause of $329m Neymar has been offered a basic salary of $45m after tax, around $857,000 a week.
"It was a huge pleasure having shared all those years with you, my friend @neymarjr," Messi wrote on Instagram next to a montage of pictures of both football stars high-fiving, embracing or laughing.
"I wish you lots of luck in this new stage in your life. See you soon tkm," he added.
"Tkm" stands for "te quiero mucho" (I love you loads).
"Thanks brother. I will miss you man," Neymar replied on Instagram.
