Another day, another Roxy Jacenko drama, this time involving her estranged father, Nick Jacenko, and his fiancee, Lisa Ho.
Police are investigating allegations that the Sweaty Betty PR boss, 36, assaulted Mr Jacenko, 66, and the former fashion designer, 53, when their paths crossed on an evening dining out in Sydney's eastern suburb of Woollahra on May 14.
"Police from the Rose Bay area command were called to Moncur street near Queen Street in Woollahra about 7pm on Saturday May 14 in relation to reports of an altercation," a police spokeswoman told Fairfax Media on Thursday.
"A number of statements were taken. Witnesses to the incident are urged to contact police."
Through her lawyer Ms Jacenko claimed the accusations were "inaccurate and defamatory of her".
Mr Jacenko told the Daily Telegraph on Wednesday that his daughter grabbed him by the collar and hit him on the head as she "screamed 'you should be ashamed of yourself' over and over".
Ms Jacenko had no response when contacted by Fairfax Media on Thursday about the street brawl allegations. The author of the Daily Telegraph article Annette Sharp is also writing Ms Jacenko's upcoming biography that will be published by Melbourne University Press.

It was business as usual on Thursday for the mother-of-two when she took to her Instagram with 126,000 followers to post an elevator selfie of her ensemble by French designer Maison Margiela, giving no mention to the allegations made about her.
Ms Jacenko was diagnosed with breast cancer in June just three weeks after husband Oliver Curtis was sentenced to two years in prison for insider trading.
