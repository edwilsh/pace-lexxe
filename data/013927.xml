  <title>Police: Missing man's disappearance 'suspicious'</title>
  <content>
POLICE are appealing for witnesses as they step up their hunt for a missing man whose disappearance is believed to be suspicious.
Sam Robert Price-Purcell was last seen on February 16, 2015 in the state's southeast region.
Police have since described his disappearance as suspicious and his family hold concerns for his safety.
The 28-year-old is described as being Caucasian in appearance, 185cm tall with a thin build, short brown hair and brown eyes.
Detective Inspector Damian Hanson, who heads the homicide squad, urged anyone with information to contact police or Crime Stoppers.
"At this stage, we are treating this matter as a suspicious disappearance and we are specifically calling for anyone who has information regarding Mr Price-Purcell's movements in early 2012 or his current whereabouts to come forward," he said.
Mr Price Purcell is more commonly know as Sam Price.
Police are expected to provide a briefing later today.
