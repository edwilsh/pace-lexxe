  <title>Don't have sex in a plane toilet</title>
  <content>
COMMERCIAL aeroplanes are very impersonal places, where passengers are squeezed elbow-to-elbow with complete strangers for hours on end.
The only time a traveller can get any privacy is when they take a quick trip to the toilet.
But now it turns out that even the plane loo isn't a sacred space.
Most planes feature secret catches on the outside of the toilet that opens the locked door.
To open it, lift up the metal sign with the word "lavatory" on it that should be attached to the door.
Underneath the flap will be a catch that, once turned, will turn the lock.
The latch has its benefits - it allows cabin crew to get inside the toilet if someone is suffering from health problems. It also means a parent can release a young child if they accidentally lock themselves in.
But it also means that for amorous couples attempting to join the Mile High Club, the overriding lock could be used as a rude interruption by a flight attendant at any given time.
If you're still tempted to join the club, there really is only type of plane loo for it.
The Sun reported earlier this year that there are two types of planes that have the perfect toilets for getting frisky - the A320P or an A321P.
These two planes have two lavatories side-by-side at the back of the aircraft.
To make them wheelchair accessible, you can convert the two cubicles into one by sliding the wall in between aside.
