CARROTS may be good for your eyesight, but the woman who picked up this one at her local supermarket suggests you might want to shield childrens' eyes.
Lizzie Fenwick picked up this "unusual" example of the vegetable at her local supermarket in Geelong.
From one angle, it's voluptuous to say the least.
From another angle, it verges on X-rated.
Lizzie gave the carrot a slowly-rotating star turn in a video she posted on Woolworths' Facebook page.
"Dear Woolies, is there a prize for 'Oddest of the Odd Bunch?' I think I have a carrot that might win it! (*Shield your children's eyes now*)", she posted with the video, before she slowly turns the carrot, with a clinically-shot big reveal.

Woolies replied if there was a prize, she would be the winner.
Unwilling to eat the voluptuous vegetable, Lizzie took it along to work to "brighten up the office'.
"I didn't realise I'd bought it - it was buried in a bag of carrots," she told news.com.au.

She's loving the carrot going viral, and said after it had been laughed at around the office, it has now ended up gurding its modesty in the compost.
