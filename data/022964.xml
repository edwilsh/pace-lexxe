Mr Cross said Lieutenant Cross, from Maine, always knew he wanted to be a pilot in the military.
"It had been his dream," he told CBS on Sunday.Photo: MC2 Sarah Villegas
"He's always been interested in all things aerial, aeronautical - (he) loved roller coasters and all things math or science so it was kind of a natural fit for him."
Mr Cross said his brother was devoted to his family and the Marine Corps, but would also do anything for anybody that needed help

"It probably sounds cliche, but you know, words really can't describe my little brother," he said.

"The highest moral character - just the most caring, compassionate, empathetic individual I've ever met."
Lieutenant Cross is one of three Marines presumed dead after the tilt-rotor aircraft MV-22 Osprey crashed during a scheduled military exercise on Saturday.
One of the other men has been identified as Osprey crew chief Corporal Nathan Ordway from Wichita, Kansas.
On the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit's Facebook page, his sister Taylor Ordway wrote: "Please pray for my brother and the other two marines."
Of the 26 people on board the aircraft on Saturday, 23 were rescued.
The Australian Defence Force is helping US authorities with the grim search for the wreckage and the bodies of the missing Marines.
It could take months to recover the aircraft and determine what caused it to crash.
Poor weather conditions are expected to hamper efforts on Monday to locate and secure the wreckage and find the bodies of the missing Marines.
Australian navy divers and an Australian navy ship have been deployed to aid the recovery mission, with media reports saying the aircraft hit the deck of a transport ship and plunged into the sea at Shoalwater Bay, near Rockhampton.
