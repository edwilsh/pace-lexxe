Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission boss Chris Dawson has been appointed as the new Police Commissioner for Western Australia.
The former WA Police deputy commissioner will replace Karl O'Callaghan, who has announced plans to retire after serving in the role for 13 years.
There were 10 candidates for the top job.
WA Premier Mark McGowan and Police Minster Michelle Roberts made the announcement, saying Mr Dawson had the "experience, the knowledge and the depth" for such an important role.
Mr Dawson will officially take on the role on August 16, two days after Commissioner O'Callaghan retires.
