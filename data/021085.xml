  <title>Communications restored to Paxton after optic fibre cable repaired</title>
  <content>
AN optic fibre cable that was cut in the Paxton area, disrupting phone and  ADSL service in and around Wollombi, Paxton, Laguna and Millfield, was  repaired early Sunday evening. 

The cable was cut by an excavator. The outage impacted approximately 2000 phone services and 800 ADSL services in addition to mobile towers in the area.
Telstra sent repair crews to the site to splice the cable, and services were restored by 7.30pm.

Telstra said it was important to dial 1100 dial before digging or excavating.
