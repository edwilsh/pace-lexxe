  <title>Pearce recalled, Darcy rested for Freo</title>
  <content>
FREMANTLE veteran Danyle Pearce has been named to play his first game since round nine, while young ruckman Sean Darcy will be rested when the Dockers take on Gold Coast at Domain Stadium on Saturday night.
Pearce, 31, has twice been dropped after falling out of favour this season, but returns as a replacement for rising star Connor Blakely, whose season is over due to shoulder surgery.
Coach Ross Lyon made good on his suggestion Darcy would be managed after six consecutive games at the top level.
Veteran Jon Griffin will play his fourth game of the season as cover for the promising 19-year-old in a ruck duel with Daniel Currie.
Currie is playing his first game of the season after Jarrod Witts could not be considered due to a shoulder injury.
Superstar Gary Ablett heads the list of inclusions for the Suns after recovering from a hamstring injury, alongside co-captain Steven May, Trent McKenzie , Mitch Hallahan and Josh Schoenfeld.
Meanwhile, West Coast champion Matt Priddis has been named on a seven man bench for the Eagles clash with St Kilda on Sunday - raising questions as to whether the 2014 Brownlow medallist will face the Saints.

The bench will be cut by three tomorrow. Priddis, who announced his retirement in a shock move last week and missed West Coast's 68-point win against Brisbane last weekend with what was described as a "quad" strain, is one of four inclusions to the team along with Chris Masten, Josh Hill and ruckman Nathan Vardy, who missed the Brisbane match with a strained glute.
Defender Tom Barrass will miss the game with a groin strain.
All four inclusions for the game were named on the bench, along with tagger Mark Hutchings, forward Malcolm Karpany and midfielder Dom Sheed.
Barring injury, Sheed looks a certain starter after impressive form against Brisbane, meaning the three exclusions will come from the other six. Young midfielder Luke Partington will play again after a 16 disposal debut against the Lions.
The Saints named Nick Riewoldt for what shapes as an emotion-charged game after the champion Saint announced his retirement during the week. Koby Stevens, ruckman Tom Hickey and Nathan Wright were also name don the bench while Jack Lonie was omitted after St Kilda's last gasp loss to Port Adelaide in Adelaide last weekend.
The game could also be Sam Mitchell's last in Melbourne after he confirmed he would retire at the end of the season.
Michael Rischitelli (managed), Callum Ah Chee (shoulder), Brayden Fiorini (hamstring) and Ben Ainsworth (knee) were all forced out, with Jesse Lonergan dropped.
