  <title>Blessed to have monster spider in house</title>
  <content>
RE THE Coast's biggest spider (Daily, July 28).
How lucky you both are to have this beautiful huntsman spider being a member of your household. It works for you day and night hunting out any beastly bugs and other enemies.
So your home is blessed as it's his home too. It won't bite you so just admire it and say a few kind words each day.
As for your friend's advice about moving home or flamethrowers, disregard their suggestions - totally unworthy.
Keep your 'other' family member as long as you can, he's (maybe she's) a vital part of our so vital environment. Best of luck.
