  <title>Qantas A380 dumps fuel as it circles off Wollongong coast</title>

The plane's movements, as seen on flightradar24.com
A Dallas-bound Qantas A380 that's encountered a mechanical problem is circling in the sky off the coast of Wollongong, dumping fuel as it prepares to return to Sydney. 
In a statement, Oantas said the flight, QF7, was returning to Sydney Airport due to "a mechanical issue".
"The flaps on the aircraft (which are attached to the wing) are unable to retract which means the aircraft can't fly efficiently," the statement said.
"As the Dallas flight is our longest on the network, the captain made the decision to return to Sydney.
"The aircraft - an Airbus A380 -  is expected to land at around 4pm Sydney time where it will be inspected by engineers."
The plane has been seen flying low over Wollongong on Friday afternoon. 
Meanwhile, a second flight - Qantas flight QF63 to Johannesburg - also needed to return to Sydney due to an engineering issue on Friday afternoon.
"This aircraft has landed safely. It is a Boeing 747-400 and has an unrelated issue to the QF7," Qantas said.
