  <title>Consent for polluting coal mine in Sydney's water catchment invalid, court finds</title>

Environment groups say they have scored a "massive victory" against coal mining in Sydney's water catchment area after the NSW Court of Appeal found that consent should not have been granted to a mine near Lithgow.
Centennial Coal's Springvale mine was granted a 13-year extension in 2015 by the Baird government, even though the mine was discharging millions of litres of untreated waste water directly into the Coxs River.
The river is the second largest source of water for the Warragamba Dam, which supplies most of Sydney's drinking water.
4Nature, an environment group, challenged the extension's approval, arguing it was in clear conflict with the 2011 State Environmental Planning Policy requiring any development in the catchment to have a neutral or beneficial effect on water quality.
The Appeals Court result on Wednesday overturned an earlier rejection by the Land and Environmental Court, and now requires the parties to determine the mine's fate.
"The parties agreed that given the consequences for the current operations of the respondents and the users of the coal supplied by the mine, the Court should hear further submissions before making such orders," the judgment said.
"This is a massive win for the community," 4Nature spokesman Andrew Cox said.
"It was a serious test - it shows you cannot just make up your own rules."
Centennial Coal said the court's decision was "obviously disappointing" but the company had prepared for it.
"A range of options have been identified and we will now proceed to implement these options to seek to ensure Springvale can continue operating without disruption," Katie Brassil, a spokeswoman for Centennial, said.

The ruling would allow the company to make submissions, and the miner would not necessarily negotiate with environmental groups, she said.
"As no orders have been issued and further submissions will be heard, it's inappropriate to speculate about the ruling," Anthony Roberts, NSW Planning Minister said.
Don Harwin, the energy minister said: "NSW's energy supplies are secure, the NSW Government is committed to maintaining our energy security and taking all necessary steps in that regard."
Springvale mine supplies nearby Mount Piper power station, and supporters of the mine have said in the past that the power station - which supplies about 15 per cent of the state's electricity - may cease operations without the coal supply. The mine and power plant employ about 740 people, most of them local, Centennial said.
'Good precedent'

Sue Higginson, principal solicitor for the NSW Environmental Defenders Office, said the decision would have an impact on future coal or other developments across the catchment.
"It sets a really good precedent," Ms Higginson said.
Centennial Coal was left in a conundrum because it would now have to show it could operate with a neutral or beneficial effect on water quality, she said.
The NSW Environmental Protection Authority was among the agencies that had raised objections to the mine's extension because of the high salinity and other contaminants - especially compared with background levels - of its waste water.
In the past, the mine supplied the waste water to the nearby Wallerawang power station until it shut down.
Without a treatment plant of its own, the mine discharged the waste directly into the Coxs River. The pollution, of up 19 million litres a day, would amount to about two-thirds of the flows at the discharge point.
Centennial has had a poor environment record, including allowing about 2300 tonnes of coal material to discharge from its Clarence Colliery into the Wollangambe River and the World Heritage area of the Blue Mountains in 2015.
The EPA last month fined Centennial $1.05 million, a record penalty for a single prosecution.
"It's an operator that has not shown a strong commitment to the environment," Mr Cox said, noting the company's underground mines were also "destroying endangered upland swamps" in the region.
Discharge curbs delayed

"For years, Centennial Coal ... had known about the need to limit pollution from the mine entering the Coxs River," Chris Jonkers, a spokesman for Lithgow Environment Group, said. 
"Instead, the miner delayed tighter discharge rules that were due to start on July 1, 2017." 
Kevin Muir, director of the Colong Foundation, warned the government against trying to change the law, saying it would be vilified if it tried that route.
"You mean you are going to allow pollution in the drinking water - how could you?"

The company now needs to negotiate and bring forward a water treatment plant that currently has consent to be built "off in the never-never", he said.
