On Monday, Jolie issued a statement to  defending the casting process. The 42-year-old director also took a swipe at Vanity Fair, describing the magazine's claims as "false". 
"I am upset that a pretend exercise in an improvisation, from an actual scene in the film, has been written about as if it was a real scenario," she said. "The suggestion that real money was taken from a child during an audition is false and upsetting. I would be outraged myself if this had happened." 

Jolie also said parents, guardians, doctors and partner NGOs were present during auditions to "make sure that no one was in any way hurt" by recreating Cambodia's "painful" history.

"Every measure was taken to ensure the safety, comfort and wellbeing of the children on the film starting from the auditions through production to the present," she said.
First They Killed My Father's producer, Rithy Panh, also released a statement saying the auditions have been "grossly mischaracterise[d]". 
He said while some of the children were from disadvantaged backgrounds, others were not - and that all were told they were to act out a scene in which they were accused of stealing and that it was not real. 
"The children were not tricked or entrapped, as some have suggested," he said. "The children gave their all in their performances and have made all of us in the production - and, I believe, in Cambodia - very proud."
