  <title>One of the last surviving Rats of Tobruk turns 100</title>
  <content>
World War Two veteran Bill Corey is one of the last surviving Rats of Tobruk.
Today, on his 100th birthday, he was celebrated and thanked for his contribution and sacrifice to this country.
The father-of-two, grandfather-of-five and great-grandfather-of-four was surrounded by his loved ones as he marked his milestone at Government House in Adelaide this morning.
Born in 1917 in South Australia's Mid North, Mr Corey became a butcher before enlisting in the army when he was just 22 years old.
From there he spent his next four birthdays in El Alamein, New Guinea, North Queensland and Borneo.
In August 1941, he took part in the famous Siege of Tobruk in a small town on the Libyan coast. More than 3000 Australian soldiers lost their lives.
"I have always stated that the war didn't affect me, I didn't have any effects from the war, but of course it did," Mr Corey told 9NEWS.

His daughter Dianne agreed.
"I think he keeps the good memories, the others he doesn't talk much about," she said.
Mr Corey said he reflects on the war, and the mates he lost, each day.
But he has always tried to live a positive life, sharing his war stories and experiences with thousands of school children over the years.
"The main lesson that I got (is) everybody has got some good in them if it's allowed to come out," he said.
