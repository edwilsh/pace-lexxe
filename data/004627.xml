  <title>Forager's Drop made for craft beer</title>
  <content>
MITCHAM is getting its very own craft beer bar, the only one of its kind for miles around.
The Forager's Drop, at 499 Whitehorse Rd, Mitcham, will officially open on August 5.
Owner Jesse McFadyen, a draftsman by trade, said he couldn't wait for his dream to come to life.
"I've lived in Ringwood for the past six years, and there's just nowhere around here that has these little independent pubs and bars - it's just a wasteland of pokies venues," Mr McFadyen said.
"We really wanted to bring a fiercely independent craft bar to the area, so that's what we're doing."
The Forager's Drop will have 11 different taps of beer, including one on a traditional hand pump.
Some of the brews include Stone Go To IPA, Liberty Halo pilsner, Feral Brewing Company War Hog American IPA, Caltoria Belgian pale ale, and Coldstream apple cider.
"We've also got craft meads and gins, good whiskeys and fine wines," Mr McFadyen said.
The bar's decor was described as "comfortable, with little pockets of tables of couches" with images of nature hanging on the walls.
Come August 5, The Forager's Drop will be open Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and will eventually feature some live music on a Sunday.
