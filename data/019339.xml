A large-scale search is underway for three military personnel feared dead after a United States Marine Corps (USMC) aircraft crashed off the Queensland coast.
Twenty-six crew members were aboard the MV-22 Osprey when it was involved in a "mishap" about 4:00pm (AEST) yesterday, US authorities said.
The search for the crew members continued throughout the night and was ongoing this morning.
The White House said US President Donald Trump had been briefed on the search.
"The aircraft involved in the mishap had launched from the USS Bonhomme Richard ... and was conducting regularly scheduled operations when the aircraft entered the water," a statement from the III Marine Expeditionary Force said.
"The ship's small boats and aircraft immediately responded in the search and rescue efforts."
Twenty-three people were rescued within an hour, including one marine who was taken to Rockhampton Base Hospital.
"Please keep the families of those involved in the Osprey mishap near Australia in your thoughts and prayers," Commandant of the USMC Robert Neller wrote on Twitter.

Defence Minister Marise Payne confirmed no Australian personnel were involved in the mishap.
She said the US was leading the search effort but that Australia had offered assistance.
The aircraft had been in Queensland as part of .
The Osprey is a tilt-rotor aircraft that takes off and lands like a helicopter, but flies like an airplane.
They have been involved in a series of high-profile crashes in recent years.
In December, five crewmembers of an Osprey had to be rescued after their craft conducted a shallow-water landing off Okinawa after a training mishap in which a rotor blade cut a refuelling hose, according to the Marine Expeditionary Force.
During a US counter-terrorism operation in Yemen, two soldiers were reportedly injured when a USMC MV-22 experienced a "hard landing" after being called in to evacuate injured troops.
