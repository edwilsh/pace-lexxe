  <title>Match preview: Fremantle v Gold Coast</title>
  <content>
Joel Hamling has had a great first season at Fremantle despite the team's woes

SUMMARY
It has been a lean couple of months for both these sides. Fremantle was competitive on the road against GWS last round before falling away in the fourth quarter and going down by 12 points for an eighth loss in nine games. There was more to like, though, with the Dockers displaying better attacking flow from half-back and scoring 86 points - nearly the same amount as the previous two defeats to Hawthorn and West Coast combined (92) - with recruit Shane Kersten booting a Freo-best three goals. The Dockers' interstate form has been impressive compared to their record at Domain Stadium, where they have lost four in a row, although they should overcome the struggling Suns if they can stop tall forwards Tom Lynch and Peter Wright. Gold Coast has lost six of its last seven games, piling immense pressure on under-siege coach Rodney Eade.

WHERE AND WHEN: Domain Stadium, Saturday, August 5, 5.40pm AWST

LAST FIVE MEETINGS
R18, 2016, Gold Coast 16.9 (105) d Fremantle 12.9 (81) at Metricon Stadium
R2, 2016, Gold Coast 19.12 (126) d Fremantle 14.16 (100) at Domain Stadium
R11, 2015, Fremantle 6.17 (53) d Gold Coast 7.4 (46) at Metricon Stadium
R2, 2014, Fremantle 12.15 (87) d Gold Coast 5.9 (39) at Domain Stadium
R6, 2013, Fremantle 15.9 (99) d Gold Coast 7.12 (54) at Metricon Stadium 

THE SIX POINTS
1. Fremantle holds the overall head-to-head advantage 5-2, but Gold Coast won both encounters last season.

2. The Suns' key forwards were the difference when the sides last played, with Tom Lynch (four), Sam Day (four) and Peter Wright (three) combining for 11 goals.

3. These sides have laid the fewest tackles in 2017. Gold Coast is 17th averaging 63.4 per game, narrowly ahead of the Dockers at an average of 63.3.

4. Both teams have struggled to deliver the ball inside 50. The Suns are 14th and Fremantle 16th overall.

5. Gold Coast's history at Domain Stadium makes for ugly reading. The Suns have lost eight of nine games in Perth and there's been some big defeats with three by more than 70 points.

6. Dockers superstar Nat Fyfe's return to near his best form has seen him bounce back up the  chart. He has climbed to 65th overall after tumbling as low as 120th after round 15.

IT'S A BIG WEEK FOR ... Joel Hamling
Stopping Suns power forward Tom Lynch will go a long way towards the Dockers recording their first home victory since round nine.

PREDICTION: Fremantle by 12 points
