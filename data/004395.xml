  <content>
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is about to release its August interest rate decision.

While no one expects that rates will change today, there'll still be plenty of interest in the accompanying monetary policy statement, especially with the RBA set to release updated forecasts for Australian economic growth, inflation and unemployment later in the week.
