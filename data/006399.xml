  <title>Manslaughter accused claims Lynette Daley had seizure after 'wild sex'</title>
  <content>
Lynette Daley was swimming naked in the ocean after a night of "wild sex" when she had a seizure and stopped breathing, a man accused of her manslaughter told NSW police.
Adrian Attwater, 42, said he dragged her from the water with co-accused Paul Maris, 47, before starting CPR and calling triple-zero.
The crown alleges Ms Daley, 33, bled to death from injuries sustained in a sex act with the men during a camping trip to Ten Mile Beach in January 2011.
Mr Attwater has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and aggravated sexual assault. Mr Maris has pleaded not guilty to aggravated sexual assault and hindering the discovery of evidence.
The pair sought help as the sun rose. Mr Maris drove up the beach until he found a fisherman, prosecutor Philip Strickland SC told the NSW Supreme Court at Coffs Harbour on Tuesday.
He said Mr Attwater made a "last-minute, desperate, panicked call to triple-zero" but it took about 50 minutes for paramedics to arrive at the remote beach.
Those first responders are expected to give evidence at the trial on Wednesday.

Mr Strickland said Mr Attwater told an ambulance officer the trio had "a wild sex session".
"I noticed the blood and the smell was terrible so we were going into the ocean to wash," Mr Attwater allegedly said.
The jury is due to visit the beach on Friday to give them a "sense of its isolation and seclusion", Mr Strickland said.
The trial continues.
