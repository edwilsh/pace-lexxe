  <title>Dessert bar serves up sweet bites</title>

LIFE is cherry ripe for these Glen Waverley dessert connoisseurs.
Hugo's Cafe & Dessert Bar has become a dessert institution in the heart of Glen Waverley's thriving Kingsway precinct.
Brothers, Avak and Gabriel Bedikian, opened the cafe three years ago after finding their love for sweets.
Avak Bedikian said the cafe had a range of tempting sweets including cherry ripe cakes, Nutella-filled doughnuts with KitKat's jammed in the middle, Yo-Yo biscuits, baklava and vanilla slices.
"We offer something different on this strip of shops and people really enjoy our diverse range of sweets," Mr Bedikian said.
He said the pair owned a jewellery shop nearby on Kingsway since 1995 and decided to follow the demand for desserts.
"We offer a huge range of doughnuts including Golden Gaytime, Nuttella, jam, custard, salted caramel and much more."
"People love the baba which is a sponge cake smothered with apricot jam and filled with fresh cream and topped with a strawberry."
Mr Bedikian said they offered a large range of gluten free and vegan sweets.
"We cater for a range of dietary requirements including raw vegan cakes and we also have a big selection of gelati flavours."
"Our culture here is one of gratitude. We exceed people's expectations and we will always go an extra mile for our customers."
