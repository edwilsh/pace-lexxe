POLICE have retrieved a body discovered in the water at Bar Beach on Friday morning.

Officers were called to Susan Gilmore beach shortly before 8am after a member of the public found the body.
Investigators at midday said they were seeking public help to identify him.

"While the investigation is in its infancy, his death is not believed to be suspicious," NSW Police said in a statement.
"He's believed to be aged in his 50s or 60s, with a slim build and a red beard."
Inquiries are ongoing.
