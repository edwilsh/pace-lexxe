  <title>Tori Bowie takes women's 100m title by a nose</title>

Tori Bowie claimed the 100-metre world title for the US as Jamaican Olympic champion Elaine Thompson failed to medal - the day after Justin Gatlin had also won the men's race for the Americans.

Dutch 200m world champion Dafne Schippers got bronze in 10.96.
The pre-race favourite Thompson had to settle for fifth in 10.98 as Jamaica came up empty-handed.
It was the second setback for the proud sprint nation in 24 hours after Gatlin and Christian Coleman had taken gold and silver in the men's 100m ahead of retirement-bound Jamaican superstar Usain Bolt.
Tomas Walsh fought off stiff competition in the men's shot put final to win New Zealand's first gold medal at championships.

The Olympic bronze medallist Zealander threw 22.03 metres with his final attempt but he had already secured the gold with his third effort of 21.75.
"(It was a) Hell of a competition out there. It's awesome. It's something I've always dreamed about, being a world champion," Walsh said.

American Joe Kovacs, the 2015 world champion, thought he had retained his title on his last attempt which looked to be about 22 metres.
It was ruled as a foul, however, for putting his foot on the top of the throwing circle perimeter and the American had to settle for silver with his third attempt of 21.66.
The bronze medal went to Stipe Zunic of Croatia on 21.46. It was the first senior medal for the 26-year-old, who celebrated by rolling on the field of the London Stadium.
Nafi Thiam of Belgium eased her way to heptathlon gold to go with the Olympic title she claimed in Rio last year.
