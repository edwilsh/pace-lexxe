  <title>TRG, SES searching for missing man</title>

A MAJOR search is underway for a man who went missing on the Canning Stock Route in remote WA.
Anthony Collis, 32, was travelling to Darwin with a 39-year-old woman.
They were in a white Mitsubishi Triton but became separated late on Thursday afternoon.
On Thursday night, police received information from travellers after the woman walked into the Georgia Bore Camp, located approximately 8.2km north of Well 22 on the Canning Stock Route.
Police said she was disorientated and dehydrated but has since recovered.
She is now helping police who launched a major search at first light on Friday.
The search includes local police, the highly-trained Tactical Response Group trackers, a plane from the Police Airwing, State Emergency Service volunteers.
The Mitsubishi Triton was located on Friday afternoon about one kilometre north of Well 22.
However Mr Collis was not with the vehicle and there are serious concerns for his welfare. That part of WA is desert, with sand dunes, little vegetation and little water. It is very difficult to find a person if they leave their vehicle.
Mr Collis is described as 185cm tall, medium build with blonde hair and blue eyes. A Facebook page in his name says Mr Collis comes from Westbury in Wiltshire in the UK.
If you have seen him or have any information, please call police immediately on 131 444.
