  <title>Manslaughter accused says he was hit first</title>
  <content>
A New Zealander accused of punching a man before he fell into the path of an oncoming truck told Queensland police he was retaliating after being pushed and hit.
Tamate Henry Heke is on trial for the manslaughter of 50-year-old Shane Merrigan on Brisbane's Gateway Motorway at Eight Mile Plains on December 1, 2015.
The Supreme Court jury watched a video on Wednesday of Heke's interview with police, where he told officers Merrigan had gestured for the pair to pull over before he allegedly "took a swing" and pushed him twice.
