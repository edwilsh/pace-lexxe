PRINCE Harry has whisked TV star girlfriend Meghan Markle off on a romantic African birthday escape as speculation mounts a proposal is imminent.
The couple touched down on Friday, Markle's 36th birthday, in Botswana.
An intimate safari is on the couple's agenda as are boat trips, camping under the stars and dawn bush treks.
Some royal observers believe may be keen to propose to the Suits star before his birthday on September 15, when he turns 33.

It is understood he quietly visited Botswana two weeks ago as patron of the Rhino Conservation Botswana charity.
It's believed he also scouted locations to ensure his trip with  would be perfect.
The royals are not unfamiliar with a romantic African proposal - Prince William popped the question to Kate Middleton on a 2010 holiday to Kenya.
