Red Beret Hotel Cairns Cup ambassador Michelle Champion is on the look out all year for the perfect Far North racing season outfits and accessories.
Ms Champion will join in all the fun and excitement of Ladies Day tomorrow at Cannon Park Racecourse.
"I go to most of the races, I just love the chance to get dressed up and I love horses. I have had horses since I was little," she said.
"I'm really excited about Cairns Cup this year because it is over two weekends so it is more of an event. Both race days will be very different."
The Cairns heat does pose a bit of a problem for those hoping to co-ordinate their outfits with the autumn and winter trends from down south, though.
"You still want to dress appropriately for the season but it is a bit harder to wear wool and fur," Ms Champion said.
"I think it depends on whether I'm judging or competing or going along socially as to what I'll wear."
Gates open at 11am tomorrow. General admission is from $20.
