Sydney train chaos a signal failure

Commuters are seen near Sydney's Central Station at peak hour following massive train delays across the city.

A signal failure at Ashfield train station in Sydney's inner west yesterday morning caused havoc for commuters well into afternoon peak hour, with most lines experiencing major delays and mass cancellations of services.

Sydney Trains issued the first of 16 apology tweets at 10.51am, saying delays on the northern and western lines were to be -expected after urgent infrastructure repairs at Ashfield.

Seven hours later, significant flow-on delays were experienced across most major train lines.

"Sydney Trains are a joke," tweeted western Sydney resident Scott Foreman, while Nik-hil Sreekumar said: "A fault at a single station disrupts the whole of Sydney city."
