  <content>
A MAN who was reportedly riding a motorcycle on the M1 with thongs and no helmet is fighting for life after colliding with two cars.
About 5.20pm two cars and the motorcycle rider crashed just metres before the southbound Bermuda St exit on the M1.
Police and paramedics rushed to the scene after receiving multiple calls from members of the public.
A Queensland Ambulance spokeswoman said a male motorcyclist believed to be aged in his 30s or 40s was found unresponsive on the side of the road.
Witnesses reported the man was wearing shorts, thongs and no helmet while riding the bike.
Paramedics performed CPR on the man before rushing him to hospital in a critical condition.
The other drivers involved suffered minor injuries and shock.
More information to come.
