  <title>Man saves son, dog from Vic house fire</title>
  <content>
A Melbourne man has saved his son and a dog from a burning house, running into the inferno to wake them up.
The 60-year-old arrived at the Mill Park house on Tuesday afternoon and found it well alight, rushing in to save his son, who was asleep inside, the Metropolitan Fire Brigade says.
He managed to get his 35-year-old son, and his pet dog, out of the house and all three were treated by firefighters with oxygen until an ambulance arrived.
Crews attacked the blaze internally and it was under control in 40 minutes but caused substantial damage.
The father was taken to hospital and his son and the dog were treated by paramedics at the scene.
It's believed a second dog may have perished in the fire and investigators will now try to determine the cause.
