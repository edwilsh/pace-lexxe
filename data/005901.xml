  <title>Natasha Rowley farewelled in Perth</title>
  <content>
A FUNERAL has been held in Perth for Natasha Rowley, the young soldier found dead in a Melbourne apartment after a buck's night.
Police ruled out foul play after the 20-year-old Australian Defence Force member's body was found in the Oaks on Market serviced apartments on July 16.
A cremation service was held at Pinnaroo Valley Memorial Park in Padbury, in Perth's north, on Tuesday afternoon.
It was a big turnout, with many people following the family's request to wear a "splash of purple" for Ms Rowley and there were also purple flowers.
She had only officially become an Australian soldier earlier this year in NSW.
Four men who attended the buck's night were arrested after Ms Rowley's body was discovered in one of their hotel rooms, but they were later released without charge.
Ms Rowley's sister Bryanna has a tribute posted on her Facebook page that reads: "Natasha Rowley. Gone but never forgotten. I love you sister."
