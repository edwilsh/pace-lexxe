  <title>Mazda Updates 2017 BT-50 To Alpine Infotainment System</title>
  <content>
has announced that a new Alpine-branded audio and navigation system will be added to its high-grade  models.
The new system, which is included as standard equipment on the XTR and GT grade BT-50, upsizes slightly from 7.8-inches to a new 8.0-inch screen with a high-resolution touchscreen display.
The Alpine system comes loaded with satellite navigation including point-to-point off-road navigation and is video-enabled to allow playback of MP4 and MKV or streaming services like Stan, Netflix, or Foxtel Now or tablets, mobiles or portable DVD players via an HDMI input when the vehicle is stationary.

USB and 3.5mm auxiliary inputs are also included with more accessible dash-mounted access points, and the rear view camera display moves from the rear view mirror to the centre screen itself.
Mazda has also included DAB+ digital radio, live traffic updates via the Radio Data System (RDA), and Bluetooth mobile phone connectivity, although smartphone mirroring via Apple CarPlay and Android Auto aren't incorporated into the new system.

For the first time on the BT-50 the system is also capable of showing split-screen info capable of displaying audio and navigation feeds at the same time, as well as displaying climate control information.
The new system has been added for all BT-50 XTR and BT-50 GT variants as of June 2017 production, but won't be offered as an option to buyers of lower-grade vehicles.
