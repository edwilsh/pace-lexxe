  <content>
A man has been taken to hospital with serious burns after explosions caused a chemical fire in Sydney's west on Monday.
The blaze at a warehouse on Links Road, St Marys, is believed to have been started by exploding aerosol cans.
About 15 fire crews are battling the fire.
A CareFlight rapid response helicopter landed at nearby St Marys Rugby League Stadium to help paramedics treat the man, 55.
The helicopter flew the man to Westmead Hospital.

Emergency services were called when the fire broke out about 8.35am.
Police have blocked off Links Road after setting up an exclusion zone between Forrester Road and Charles Street.
A police spokesperson said Hazmat fire crews were managing the scene.
SafeWork NSW will investigate the fire.
