  <title>Bayside 'sky rail' project comes with $50m sweetener </title>

A suburban beachfront in one of Victoria's most marginal electorates will get a $50 million revamp under plans to build a controversial "sky rail" bridge.

However, five properties will have to be acquired to make way for the promenade that will run between Nepean Highway and the beach.
Labor MP Sonya Kilkenny holds Carrum on a margin of just 0.7 per cent.   

Earlier this year the government ruled out dropping the rail beneath the road, citing concerns the line could not go under the Patterson River as it was too close to McLeod Road.
The Carrum rail bridge will stretch out for 900 metres.

 On Sunday, Premier Daniel Andrews conceded that this level crossing removal would "come at considerable cost but I think it really is an investment in making this precinct really special for the future".

The prospect of so-called "sky rail" solutions to level crossing removals has proven highly contentious along the politically sensitive sandbelt seats of Melbourne's bayside. 
Many houses along the Nepean Highway by the beach have placards protesting against elevated rail.
However, Mr Andrews dismissed suggestions the upgrade was an attempt to sandbag the electorate before the 2018 election.
"That's just complete rot. We are making investments where we can and indeed almost every one of our level crossing removal projects has seen additional community benefit."

Opposition Leader Matthew Guy said Sunday's announcement was an obvious attempt to retain Carrum.
He said the government had failed to provide sufficient evidence that elevated rail was necessary.
"No-one argues against level crossing removal," he said. "But the government didn't promise this and frankly it's not what the community asked for."
No Sky Rail: Frankston Line president Willem Popp slammed the decision to build an elevated rail bridge, saying the $50 million would be better spent on a "proper solution" for the area.
"It sounds like they're trying to window-dress a bad solution for the community," he said.
McLeod Road will be extended to the beach to make way for the new promenade.
The state government has also promised to build a new "village" on the site of the current train stables at Carrum. The stabling facility will be moved to another site nearby Kananook Station.
