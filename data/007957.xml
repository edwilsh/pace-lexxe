  <title>Driverless bus to be trialled in Sydney</title>
  <content>
A driverless shuttle bus will take to NSW roads for the first time as part of a trial at Sydney Olympic Park.
The two-year trail, to begin later this month, will start with safety checks, and eventually let the public hop onto the automated vehicle, Transport Minister Andrew Constance announced on Wednesday.
The trial is a small part of the state government's vision for "a technology-enabled transport future", Mr Constance said.
