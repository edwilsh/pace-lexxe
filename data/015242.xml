  <title>Vic debt collector plans foiled by keycard</title>
  <content>
Former Melbourne debt collector Timoti Kapene Te Amo forced his ex-boss to drive to an ATM, planning to make him withdraw and handover cash, but the scheme came unstuck when the victim forgot his keycard.
At the County Court of Victoria on Friday the 47-year-old pleaded guilty to false imprisonment in addition to previous charges including assault and theft linked to a debt dispute at a Braybrook factory in March 2016.
Kapene Te Amo held the man in a headlock next to a stone cutting machine, then forced him to drive to an ATM before turning back because the victim's bank card was still at the factory, the court was told.
