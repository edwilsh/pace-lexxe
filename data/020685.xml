  <title>Lew junior plots UK retail expansion for Global Retail Brands </title>
  <content>
It's unusual for retailers to be expanding rather than flailing in this macro-economic environment. 
So it's interesting that Steven Lew is opening new HOUSE and Robins Kitchen homeware stores in Australia and pushing into the UK market at the same time. 
Lew, the son of retail stalwart and billionaire Solomon Lew, is said to be opening new local stores at Malvern Central in Victoria and then Carindale in Queensland. He is the executive chairman of private group Global Retail Brands which has also mapped out an expansion plan in the UK where he expects to open the first stores by April next year. 
Management have just returned from scouring that market for retail sites and want to have 75 stores in place within  three years. The company has 170 stores in Australia after it acquired Robins out of administration in 2014. 

Global Retail joins the likes of other local companies seeking inroads in the UK, including , stationery group Kikki.K, ASX-listed Lovisa and Lew senior's Premier Investments with brands like Smiggle.

The threat of Amazon has put a dent in the share prices of many local retail stocks while other firms have been hit by competition from global retail brands including Zara and H&M. Already this year, Myer has purchased Marcs and David Lawrence for an undisclosed sum, after the brands were placed in administration.
