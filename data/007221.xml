  <title>Video released in Obeid-linked fires probe</title>
  <content>
Dramatic security footage appears to show two people pouring fuel around a western Sydney function centre linked to the Obeid family.
The vision was released by NSW police on Wednesday as part of an appeal for information about two suspicious fires at the Bellevue Reception Centre in Bankstown.
The fires happened almost a week apart in December 2016 and January 2017.
AAP understands the reception centre is owned by the company Redpoc, whose directors are Paul Obeid, son of corrupt former NSW minister Eddie Obeid and former business partner Walhan Wehbe.
The first fire was put out relatively quickly early on Boxing Day 2016 but caused major smoke damage.
The second blaze on January 3 caused major damage to the building.
The CCTV vision captures two people appearing to pour fuel around the centre's interior and flames engulfing the floor.
It also shows an XR model Ford utility seen in the area about the time of the fire.
Detectives want to speak to anyone who recognises the people or the ute.
