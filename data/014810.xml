  <title>Tabcorp posts $20.8m full-year loss</title>
  <content>
Tabcorp has slipped to a full-year net loss of $20.8 million on the back of costs related to its proposed merger with Tatts, legal battles and its new UK business.
The result contrasts sharply with last year's $169.7 million profit and comes amid a two per cent lift in revenue to $2.23 billion for the 12 months to June 30.
The gaming giant, which is in the process of completing a merger with Tatts Group, declared a fully franked final dividend of 12.5 cent per share, taking full-year dividend to 25 cents.
