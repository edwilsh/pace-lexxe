  <title>Woman claims she found a bullet in her steak</title>
  <content>
AN Australian woman claims she's found a bullet fragment in her kangaroo steak, which she purchased from supermarket giant Woolworths.
Taking to Facebook, Kath Milroy Pattingale posted a photo of the steak - which clearly shows the golden shell sitting in the centre of the meat.
"Mmmmmm thanks Woolies - nothing more appetising than a bullet in my kangaroo!," her post read, which has been liked more than 25,000 times.
"This pic was taken on a chopping board when we were cutting up the meat (a 60mm thick fillet) after taking if off the barbie - it didn't make it to the dinner plate!"
Ms Pattingale claims she left the meat in the fridge for a Woolworths representative to look at.
Her post was met with 12,000 comments, with some social media users claiming it could be a stitch up.
"Looks like a con to me," one person posted.
"Certainly Woolworths would run their meats through a metal detector before sending it off," another wrote.
A Woolworths Australia spokesperson told news.com.au in a statement that they "take all customer concerns seriously and are investigating the issue raised".
The post has since been deleted
News.com.au has contacted Ms Pattingale for comment.
