  <title>Hull FC v Wigan, Challenge Cup final at Wembley Stadium ahead of Wollongong clash</title>
  <content>
CELEBRATIONS: Wigan Warriors stars Anthony Gelling and Joe Burgess celebrate their semi final win over the Salford Red Devils which will see them square off against arch rivals Hull FC in the Challenge Cup final at the famous Wembley Stadium on August 26.

HULL FC and the Wigan Warriors will square off in what Hull FC coach Lee Radford has described as a "fairytale" clash before both teams meet in Wollongong and February.
Overnight the Wigan Warriors won their semi-final and will now play Hull FC in an expected sellout Challenge Cup final at the famous Wembley Stadium on August 26.

Speaking before Wigan's win, Radford foreshadowed a possible showdown as a dream clash on the back of last week's Illawarra Mercury  which revealed the two British clubs would play a history-making Super League clash at Wollongong's WIN Stadium on February 10.
The Wollongong match will be the first Super League for premiership points held outside of Europe.
"I really hope we get Wigan in the final," Radford told Skysports.com ahead of the Wigan win.

"And, with announcement that we're both going to Australia, it would be fairytale final and I'm sure our players would revel in it."

The Wollongong clash is part of a unique deal struck between Wigan, the NSW Government, Destination NSW and Destination Wollongong, which will also see the UK clubs spend the better part of two weeks in the Illawarra and South Coast.
The Wigan Warriors are already promoting the partnership with star Anthony Gelling pictured wearing a "I Heart The Gong" t-shirt during the celebrations in the changerooms after the semi-final win.
