  <title>Qld barrister fined $4000 for contempt</title>
  <content>
A Brisbane barrister who claimed the $50,000 in cash that former Ipswich mayor Paul Pisasale was found with at Melbourne airport has been fined for contemptuous comments made to a magistrate.
Sam Di Carlo appeared in the Brisbane Supreme Court on Wednesday over contempt proceedings brought by the attorney-general in relation to comments he made to magistrate John Costello in January last year.
While noting all lawyers experience frustration at times, Chief Justice Catherine Holmes agreed Mr Di Carlo's remarks amounted to contempt and fined him $4000, to be paid within three months.
