  <title>Zebrafish could hold key to early brain development</title>
  <content>
University of Queensland researchers have turned off the lights in a room full of zebrafish larvae and found being kept in the dark hinders their "lightbulb" moments.
Zebrafish larvae were chosen for the neurological study due to their quick development (they can go from a single cell to catching prey in five days) and their transparent skin to help investigate the origins of spontaneous neural activity in the form of new thoughts that did not rely on stimuli.Photo: Professor Geoffrey Goodhill
Queensland Brain Institute professor Geoffrey Goodhill said it was not clear what role spontaneous neural activity - the firing of neurons in the brain - played, but said one theory suggested the activity helped "tune the system up" for future stimulation.
"If you look at any part of the brain then you will find that, especially early in life, there is always some level of spontaneous activity," he said.
"Normally neurons fire in response to stimuli but even if you remove all stimuli, the neurons will sometimes still be active just by chance.
"The idea is that through evolution, there have been mechanisms implanted in the brain that allow it to generate patterns of activity that look a bit like the patterns it would generate if there were stimuli."

Researchers discovered the "dark reared" larvae had less spontaneous activity in the part of the brain that processes visual images compared to larvae that was reared in "natural light".
Professor Goodhill said researchers, led by Lilach Avitan, also discovered larvae kept in the dark were miserable at catching their prey compared to their natural light counterparts.

"On day six (of the study), the normal fish managed to eat about half the paramecia (their prey) while the dark reared fish ate virtually none," he said.
"For another three days we let them both have normal visual experience...but by nine days there was still a difference between them.
"This shows that the environment affects the way the zebrafish brain becomes wired up as it grows, and this wiring change affects the fish's behaviour."
Professor Goodhill said further experiments could investigate exactly how early life experience during the "critical period", which is considered up to about the age of 12 in humans, affects brain development.
"Perhaps down the track we can look at how we might be able to reverse those changes...at the moment they appear to be long lasting," he said.
"For example you have a cataract that is there during the critical period, even if you remove the cataract usually that eye never recovers."
The study was published in the journal Current Biology.
