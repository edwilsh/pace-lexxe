  <title>Kyrgios retires hurt on return to circuit</title>
  <content>
WASHINGTON: Nick Kyrgios has been booed off court after he retired from his second-round Washington Open clash with Tennys Sandgren due to a shoulder injury.
The 22-year-old Australian was losing 6-3 3-0 to the world No.106 American on Wednesday when he pulled the pin after being in obvious discomfort.

Plays of the Week

Nail-biting finishes, ripping yorkers and hat-trick heroes, these are the plays of the week.

He battled a right shoulder injury throughout the contest and was caught on camera in the first set appearing to tell his mother Nill that he didn't want to play.

Speaking to the press afterwards, Kyrgios said physical struggles had damaged his preparation for the Washington Open, before ATP cut the media conference short.
It was Kyrgios' first tournament since he retired during the first round of Wimbledon last month due to a chronic hip injury.

He reached the second round in Washington after a bye in the opening round and was due to play Sascha Zverev in the third round.

Prior to Kyrgios' failure against Sandgren, Zverev was asked about the prospect of facing the Australian.
"Right now Nick is asleep in the locker room," Zverev said.
"I think [he] will wake up and I think he'll be motivated, and I think he wants to play me again. I think that's an extra motivation for both of us.
"I lost to him in Indian Wells and Miami, and in Miami it was a very tight match. But a lot of things have changed since then.
"I'm number eight in the world, he was number 11 in the world back then. A few things have changed and hopefully it can be another great match for us."
Zverev was later seen pleading with tournament director Keely O'Brien to keep his third-round match, now against Sandgren, on the main court.
Australian Jordan Thompson had come frustratingly close to upsetting Zverev.
The 23-year-old Thompson lost 4-6 6-3 7-6 at the ATP event, leading the third- set tiebreak at 5-4 before conceding the final three points of the match.
Two points away from one of the biggest victories of his career, Thompson put a routine backhand into the net and then double-faulted.
Zverev put away the match with a cross-court forehand.
Thompson, ranked 75 in the world, earlier broke his German opponent twice to take the opening set of the pair's first meeting.
Zverev rallied in the second, taking advantage of the weaker service game of Thompson who won only 36 per cent of points on second serve in the set.
"I'm just happy to get through that one, 7-6 in the third is always something very nice," Zverev said.
"You feel good about yourself. Hopefully I can do it better the next match."
Zverev, the winner of three titles in 2017,will face Sandgren in the third round.
Earlier, Australian Marc Polmans lost his second-round match to American Jared Donaldson in straight sets.
The 20-year-old Polmans was beaten 6-2 6-3 by the world No.69.
Tenth-ranked Canadian Milos Raonic also advanced by defeating Nicolas Mahut 7-6 (7-2) 7-6 (10-8).
Raonic, the 2014 Washington Open champion, next faces veteran Marcos Baghdatis.
