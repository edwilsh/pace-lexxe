  <title>'Treat us with some respect': Diggers and Dealers opening</title>
  <content>
A West Australian Indigenous leader has defended the practice of Welcome to Country ceremonies, after a mining conference in Kalgoorlie tried to cancel his address.
Last month the organisers of Kalgoorlie's annual Diggers and Dealers conference said they would not go ahead with the traditional welcome but reversed the decision after a public backlash.
Kalgoorlie elder Trevor Donaldson used today's address to defend the ceremonies.
"Welcoming visitors and guests to country is an important part of our custom ... all we ask is treat us and our culture, the oldest surviving culture in the world, treat us with some respect," he said.
Mr Donaldson gave an eight-minute presentation and said he hoped the "miscommunication" that led to the cancellation was not repeated.
"I hope that it's once bitten, twice shy, that we don't venture down the track of ... engaging in that sort of blow up in the media and the miscommunications. I think we're bigger and smarter than that," he said.
"Hopefully we move on, we learn from the experience and become wiser people."
Last month the event's organiser, John Langford, said  because he was worried the presentation Mr Donaldson was preparing would take too long.
But after public criticism, including from local One Nation MP Robin Scott, the Welcome to Country was reinstated.
Mr Donaldson said he never intended to speak for half-an-hour and is relieved the presentation is now over.
"The feedback has been fantastic from a lot of the delegates from around here that have come up and said well done and that's always encouraging," he said.
"I didn't have any evil intentions to derail it and make a huge political statement out of it because of the refusal in the first place.
"It was about sort of understanding each other and respecting each other in this space because the Diggers and Dealers is fantastic for our community, for the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder and our economy."
His welcome simply involved handing over some garlgulla, the silky pears after which Kalgoorlie was named, to Kate Stokes, the widow of Diggers and Dealers founder Geoffrey Stokes.
Emotions running high over Elijah Doughty death

The decision to cancel the Welcome to Country came during a tough period for the town of Kalgoorlie, with emotions still raw over .
Last month a 56-year-old non-Indigenous man was sentenced to three years' jail over the 14-year-old's death.

The man ran over the teenager after chasing him through scrubby bush on the outskirts of Kalgoorlie in a four-wheel-drive, believing he had stolen his motorbike.
He maintained the teenager veered in front of him and was found guilty of dangerous driving occasioning death.
Police had charged him with the more serious charge of manslaughter and Elijah's supporters argued his actions amounted to murder.
Diggers and Dealers attendees said the timing of the controversy, so soon after the trial, had not gone unnoticed.
But Ashok Parekh, a Kalgoorlie publican and the Chairman of MacPhersons Resources, argued the cancellation of the ceremony had been blown out of proportion.
"I think it was overrated," he said. "I think the Diggers and Dealers committee have handled it very well ... there was an issue and they sorted it out very quickly.
"So there's no really big deal to it."
Speaking at the Diggers and Dealers conference, One Nation MP Mr Scott praised Elijah's mother, Petrina James, whom he met yesterday.
"She was the one that called for peace and harmony, she didn't want any more demonstrations," he said.
"She was very, very friendly towards me, we had a good chat for about 15 minutes.
"It's up to the community now to heal."
Mr Scott has backed Mr Donaldson's .
The Diggers and Dealers conference runs until Wednesday.
