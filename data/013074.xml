Floods in Thailand's northern and eastern regions have killed at least 23 people and left two missing with damage estimated about $A378 million.
Ten provinces have been flooded due to heavy rains, affecting 721,500 people, the Interior Ministry said on Thursday.
It said about 1554sqkm of rice farming land had been affected.
The hardest hit is Sakon Nakhon province, about 640km east of Bangkok, which has recorded nine deaths.
Schools and department stores in the province remain shut.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha visited flood victims in Sakon Nakhon on Wednesday and said the government was working on a big project to fix flooding.
