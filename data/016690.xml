  <title>Palmer's bid to delay plane trial fails</title>
  <content>
CLIVE Palmer's bid to reclaim a $5 million private jet will go to trial later this month despite the former politician's attempts to delay the case.
Queensland Nickel's general liquidators have been holding the Cessna Citation X hostage at a Gold Coast Airport hangar for more than a year while a Supreme Court battle is ongoing over the ownership of the plane.
Mr Palmer asserts he is the true owner of the plane and a trial was set down to begin on August 17.
But Mr Palmer's lawyers made an application yesterday to adjourn the trial, arguing there was overlap with a multimillion-dollar lawsuit being launched by the special government-appointed liquidators.
Justice John Bond said the adjournment was "not justified" and ordered the trial to go ahead.
Mr Palmer was also ordered to pay the liquidators' costs.
