  <title>Riewoldt one of Queensland's greatest</title>
  <content>
NICK Riewoldt slots into the big three of Queensland footy.
No Queenslander has ever played more VFL/AFL games.
CALLING TIME:
JON ANDERSON:
Discussions about Queensland's greatest player have always centred on Jason Dunstall and Michael Voss - they are the undisputed kings of the Sunshine State and among the greatest the game has ever seen.
Below them, for a time, sat Jason Akermanis and Riewoldt.
But now, as he approaches the end of his glittering career, the case can be made that Riewoldt has leapfrogged Aka to sit in third place.
Aka was a human highlight reel, a Brownlow Medallist who produced some brilliant individual performances.
But he wasn't a leader. His individualism eventually saw him fall out with teammates and coaches at the Lions and Bulldogs.
Riewoldt was the exact opposite.
Pick the attributes that coaches and teammates love in a player and Roo has them in spades.
He trains harder than anyone. His work rate on game day is the equal of any bigman to have ever played the game. He is selfless and crazy brave.

He is a five time All-Australian and a six-time club champion. No one in the history of the game has taken more marks than him.
He played his career in an era of great centre half-forwards - Lion Jonathan Brown came along at the same time and it is difficult to split them.
Brown had a purple patch where he was the most dominant player in the competition but Riewoldt's longevity and consistency justifiably puts him alongside the Lion king as the best key forward of his era.

Later in his career he has shown the art of reinvention playing up on a wing where his running prowess makes men 15 years his junior look pedestrian.
It would take a lifelong St Kilda supporter to rank him among the Saints' greats but from afar he is also in their big three. He sits alongside Darryl Baldock and is perhaps ahead of Tony 'Plugger' Locket and Ian Stewart because he played his whole career there.
Unlike Voss and Dunstall he never tasted premiership success.
And it is the lack of team success that probably keeps him just shy of that pair but it is a close run thing.

AFL: St Kilda's Nick Riewoldt will call time on his career, as he is set to announce his retirement from footy.

Riewoldt to hang up the boots
