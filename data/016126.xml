  <title>Hospital services may be cut after review</title>
  <content>
State and territory health ministers say hospital treatments and services will suffer under a commonwealth proposal to withhold budgeted funds and reduce spending.
Federal health minister Greg Hunt has drafted a directive to the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority to review its public hospital funding method.
It would result in retrospective funds not being paid and reduced services in future, Queensland health minister Cameron Dick said in a joint statement issued after the COAG Health Council meeting in Brisbane on Friday.
