  <title>Darwin Cup: a boost for the Top End economy as southern horse trainers fly their stables north</title>

It's a bucket list carnival for many horse trainers, but there's much more to a win at the Darwin Cup than just flying in for the big race.
Victorian thoroughbred trainer Danny Penna has put a lot on the line to give his stable the best chance of success.
The Mangalore Park stable manager from Seymour, in north-eastern Victoria, brought 12 horses and two staff up months before the carnival began to help the animals adjust to the weather and the dirt racing track.
"The heat and the humidity is the main thing that everybody pre-warned us about, hence we tried to get out here as early as possible this year," said Mr Penna.

He has leased stables at the Fannie Bay Race Course for six months, which was a big decision for the trainer, who brought horses to Darwin for the first time last year, with moving and accommodation alone costing more than $50,000.
The son of a South Australian bush trainer who has worked in the industry all his life, and set up stables for the owner of  Melbourne Cup winner Americain, Mr Penna believes the investment is justified.
With a handful of races still to be run this season in Darwin, including the Cup, he said he had broken even financially, with three wins and 13 places.
'Christmas in July' in Darwin boosts local economy

But it's not just the $2 million in prize money that lures interstaters to the Top End.
"It's just one of those must-do carnivals," said Thoroughbred Racing NT chief Andrew O'Toole.
"The weather is the big attraction, certainly for the trainers who like to get out of the Victorian winter, and who can blame them?"
While the Mangalore Park team have pushed the envelope with their six-month stint up north, most southern trainers come well before the first race to get their horses acclimatised, Mr O'Toole said, and that provides a significant boost to the local economy.
"Feed merchants, farriers, transport companies, vets: those sort of guys in the industry obviously get a return out of the addition people who come to the carnival," he said.
"They call [the carnival] Christmas in July in Darwin."
Southern horses sample life in the tropics

The carnival has steadily grown since the early 2000s, when race organisers targeted trainers down south, and this year the Darwin carnival has attracted 25 visiting trainers with nearly 130 horses.
For the Mangalore stud, it has been an opportunity to introduce the stable to beach life.
"As far as I remember, anyone who's ever talked about Darwin has talked about the beach and putting them in the water," Mr Penna said.
Although it's no summer holiday, the salt water eases racing injuries and keeps the charges cool and happy.
"They've got to be fit, and they've got to be tough, because that's what the locals are," Mr Penna said.
'Some love it, some hate it'

Adapting to the fast-paced dirt track is another challenge for the Victorians, accustomed to running staggered turf races and chasing down a win on the straight.

"Some love it, some hate it; we've got nothing like it in Victoria and I'm pretty sure there's nothing in NSW, certainly on the tracks we've been to," Mr Penna said.
Behind the scenes, more work goes into keeping the athletes mentally and physically cool with ice boots, backpacks full of ice, and stable fans.
But, like humans, some horses just don't like the heat: Mangalore Park staffer Chennelle Ellis said the horses have been forced out of their comfort zone.
"We started with 12, we've got nine now," she said.
"Three have gone to the paddock because they just didn't handle it, they didn't like the stable life or track work life."
But just as it sometimes does for the locals, the daily beach ride was marred by a crocodile, which Mr Penna said was spotted around the corner from their Mindil Beach training spot.
"The girls get a bit jumpy," he said.
"All I can tell them is, as far as I know there's never been a horse taken up here, or a rider off a horse, so if something happens at least they'll go out in flames."
Mr Penna likened his horses' season in the Top End to taking kids to summer camp, saying the tougher conditions helped them mature.
"The hope is at a the end of the day you take a sound horse home who can still perform well down south and you can say that's been a good experience for them as well," he said.
