  <title>Papua New Guinea 'illegal logging exports continue', despite Peter O'Neill's promise to stop it</title>
  <content>
An environment protection group says timber from illegal logging operations in Papua New Guinea is being used in flooring sold in the United States, and possibly in Australia - despite Prime Minister Peter O'Neill's promise to put an end to it.

Key points:

Mr O'Neill issued instructions for all operations all to be cancelled last year
When landowners protest, they are often arrested by police
The logs were tracked from PNG to China, and then from China to the US

Global Witness tracked timber from operations purporting to be agricultural projects but which supply tropical hardwood to the lucrative flooring market.
The group said the timber was reaching the United States, even though the US has laws against using timber from operations which are illegal or which dispossess indigenous people.
Global Witness's Rick Jacobsen was one of the authors of the report into the sale of timber from the country's controversial Special Agricultural Business Leases (SABL).
"It turns out that the wood that's being cut there - often associated with abuses in land rights of indigenous people and deforestation - that wood is actually turning up in US markets, in the case of hardwood flooring," he said.
Global Witness tracked the wood from PNG to China, then from China to major retailers in the United States.
It found Chinese manufacturers believed smaller retailers in the US could flout the laws against using illegally sourced timber with impunity.
Global Witness said one manufacturer, Nature Flooring, was advertising PNG timber through its Australian subsidiary.

The timber - taun - is advertised as "Pacific Mahogany" in a catalogue on the company's Australian website.
But a Nature Flooring spokesman said it had not been sold in Australia.
"Nature Flooring does not and has not been selling PNG sourced timbers in Australia," the spokesman said.
"The said timber had been offered for sale in North America, but has since been withdrawn."

Mr Jacobsen said there were no restrictions on where Chinese manufacturers could source their timber.
"The importers in China don't take into account whether the wood was sourced legally in PNG or not," he said.
"So that's not much of an incentive for laws to be followed in PNG.
"If you can ignore the laws and still find a willing market for the wood, you're really not incentivising good governance."
The SABLs have been contested since 2011, when the PNG Government established a Commission of Inquiry into their legality.
Peter O'Neill places blame on his departments

Mr O'Neill had issued instructions for all of the countries SABLs to be cancelled last year, but many continue to export logs.
He blamed his departments, saying they had not followed his instructions.
"Our government has already cancelled all the SABL licences," he said.
"It is the agencies of government who are supposed to be doing their job, who are not doing their job.
"I've told the landowners who are complaining about SABL licences to throw the developers out."

But when landowners protest, they are often arrested by police who support the logging companies.
A number of landowners from the Pomio area have been trying to stop logging by giant forestry company Rimbunan Hijau, which has a SABL over the area.
Landowners blocked roads to stop the company going in to new areas unless it renegotiated its lease, but many had been arrested by police and detained.
Rimbunan Hijau said most of the landowners supported its operation, and that it had all the relevant legal permits and landowner consent to conduct its work.
"The project enjoys the strong support of more than 80 per cent of landowners," it said in a statement.
The company said it had not received any new information from the Government about the status of its SABL lease, possibly because PNG was in an election period.
It said logging in PNG was "strictly controlled and audited" and that green groups were running a baseless campaign aimed at ending tropical logging.
