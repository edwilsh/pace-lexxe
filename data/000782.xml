  <title>Fair dinkum win for future Aussie</title>
  <content>
A FILIPINO man will use his million-dollar lottery winnings to become an Australian - and feed his wife's luxury brand habit.
The young family man won a division one prize of $1.05 million in Saturday's Tattslotto Superdraw.
The man, who wanted to remain anonymous, bought the ticket from Caulfield Pharmacy & Lotto.
He said he was overjoyed by the "crazy" news.
"We are going to pay off the credit card and use the rest to apply for our permanent residency and citizenship," he said.
"We will use the rest to plan our future here.
"My wife will love it - she likes Prada and Valentino shoes."
The regular player has previously won $4000 in Tattslotto, but "nothing as big as this" from his "lucky store".
"I'm so lucky with the Caulfield Pharmacy & Lotto, nearly every time I buy there I win," he said.
Store manager Melanie Connor said she was thrilled to have a division one winning customer.
"It's very exciting; it's our first one this year," she said.
"We wish (the family) all the best with their win and hope they enjoy their prize."
Across Australia there were 19 division one winning entries in Saturday night's draw, including nine from Victoria.
