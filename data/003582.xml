  <title>Results of landmark report into sexual assaults at Australian universities 'heartbreaking'</title>
  <content>
Findings from a landmark report into the level of sexual assaults and harassment have been described as "heartbreaking" by National Union of Students president Sophie Johnston.
She said the report, which is due to be released on 10am AEST today, shows significantly more women than men are assaulted and harassed. There is also a disproportion number of LGBTI students affected.
"It was heartbreaking when I saw the results," Ms Johnston told ABC TV.
"I think it wasn't necessarily because they were different or any more severe than what I expected, I guess it was just, after decades and decades of silence from so many victims, to actually hear the voices and see these stories is very confronting."
The report was commissioned by Universities Australia to gauge the level of sexual assaults and harassment amid claims the institutions were involved in covering up claims made by victims.
The Human Rights Commission was commissioned to survey thousands of students from 39 universities last year and produce the report, which is the largest of its kind.
Ms Johnston said the report was compiled after another survey in 2015 found two thirds of respondents reported some form of sexual assault or harassment.
She said the fact that universities were very small communities where lots of partying involving alcohol took place had contributed to the problem.
"There is also a serious lack of education around consent and respectful relationships," she said.
"That goes back to primary school and high school where the sex education we provide to young people in Australia just isn't doing the job."
Part of Universities Australia's initial response to the report has been to announce a 10-point plan to help prevent assault and harassment, better support students, and more training for staff.
Australian National University vice-chancellor Brian Schmidt says people should be shocked by the report's findings.
"They will tell us an ugly truth about how young people, in particular, are affected by sexual violence," he said.
"It is not an issue that we can simply acknowledge, then move onto the next thing. It is an issue that we must deal with."
Ms Johnston will join Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins and Universities of Australia chair Prof Margaret Gardener to release the report in Sydney.

In April last year a video, obtained by Junkee, captured a group of male students from the University of NSW chanting a song glorifying rape on a boys' night out.
The students, from the Philip Baxter College, were chanting a song which refered to women as "buns in the oven" who should be "creamed by the dozen" and shot.
In a statement released today, UNSW condemned the students' actions and "demeaning attitudes".
"UNSW is appalled by the sexist and demeaning attitudes and behaviours towards women outlined in these allegations and is taking immediate steps to investigate," the statement read.
