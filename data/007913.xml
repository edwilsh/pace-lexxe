Six people have been arrested after a five-hour standoff with police in Melbourne.
Specialist police were called to a unit in Boronia at 5am on Wednesday after an alleged assault, and they remained on the scene until 10am, when five men and a woman were arrested without incident.
A two-year-old boy and four-year-old girl, as well as a gun, were found inside the property, police say.
