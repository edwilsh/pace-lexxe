  <title>Woman charged over shooting</title>
  <content>
A SECOND person has been charged with the attempted murder of a Toowoomba man in July.

The 20-year-old victim had been speaking with two men outside a house on Curzon St in the early hours of July 19 when he was shot and wounded in his stomach and leg.

He was taken to hospital with serious but non-life threatening injuries.

A 26-year-old woman has been charged with attempted murder, after a 23-year-old Scarborough man was charged with the same crime last month.

She will face Toowoomba Magistrates Court today.

The accused man has already faced court and was remanded in custody to reappear on September 14.
