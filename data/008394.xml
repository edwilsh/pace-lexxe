  <title>Kriv Stenders on his new films Australia Day and The Go-Betweens: Right Here</title>
  <content>
Judged by his own standards, Kriv Stenders​ must be Australia's most successful filmmaker right now.
"To me 'success' isn't really about 'critical success' or 'box office success'," the Brisbane-raised, Sydney-based director says. "Success is being able to work. That's how I look at it: if you're working you're successful, no matter what."Photo: Vince Valitutti
Stenders has two films opening at the Melbourne International Film Festival this weekend, both of them shot this year: the hyper-kinetic, gritty urban drama Australia Day and the tender music documentary The Go-Betweens: Right Here.
He's also just finished Wake in Fright, his mini-series take on Kenneth Cook's 1961 novel (famously and brilliantly filmed in 1971 by Canadian Ted Kotcheff​), which is due to screen on Ten later this year. Photo: Vince Valitutti
He's working on a documentary series with Sally Aitken (David Stratton: A Cinematic Life) and Sam Neill, retracing the three journeys Captain Cook made through the Pacific in the 18th century.
And we haven't even mentioned Red Dog: True Blue, Kill Me Three Times and the SBS series The Principal - all shot since 2014, along with some other directing work on series TV.

New ways of watching

"It's my passion, it's also my living," Stenders says. When he started out, he made ads and music clips (including for the Go-Betweens). "It's how I used to make a living between films," he says. "I joke that I used to make TV commercials, now I make the stuff in between TV commercials."

Financed by Foxtel, the film premiered at the Sydney Film Festival in June, and after MIFF will get a small cinema release before making its way to the pay TV platform.
All of which is fine by Stenders, who is as pragmatic as he is prolific. "I'm not a cinema purist - I think any screen is a great screen."Photo: Supplied
The demand for content is at an all-time high, he believes, and only likely to increase, but new approaches to getting that content in front of people are essential.
"Anything that builds upon the crumbling ruin that was the exhibition system," he says. "It's all about moving forward and keeping this industry alive."
I used to make TV commercials. Now I make the stuff in between TV commercials.

Looking back

If Australia Day is about embracing emerging models of finance, production and distribution, his Go-Betweens film is very much about looking back.
"It's a love letter to not only that band and their music, but also that time in my life - in all of our lives in that generation, that point in your life when you're young and you go on these adventures and you have these friendships and you make these bonds, and sometimes the bonds last and sometimes they don't."
The Brisbane band emerged in the late 1970s and attained cult status in the early 1980s. Around a nucleus of singer-songwriters Robert Forster and Grant McLennan and drummer Lindy Morrison, other musicians came and went until the band dissolved in acrimony in the late '80s. From 2000, Forster and McLennan resurrected the Go-Betweens and released three more critically acclaimed albums before McLennan died, aged 48, in 2006.
"There was something in the Go-Betweens' music and their story that has always haunted me," says Stenders, who first met them in his late teens. "There's always been a bitter-sweet quality about them, and I've always wanted to make a film about them.
"Originally I thought about making a fictional film about a band like the Go-Betweens, but there was just something inherent in that story about two guys who meet at uni and embark on this great adventure and build this family of artists around them that I just thought was really powerful. And there was a finiteness that happened to that story when Grant died, so there was a complete arc there."
Not your typical rock doc

The Go-Betweens were never a typical rock band, and so Stenders was determined to avoid the cliches of the typical rock doc. No mixing desks, no pubs, no stages with propped guitars in the background.
Instead, he interviewed the surviving band members in an old Queenslander house, owned by his sister in the hinterland behind Mt Tambourine.
"It's this amazing Arthur Dodson house, built around the turn of the last century," says Stenders, the son of an architect. The choice, he explains, "was partly pragmatic and partly creative. I wanted to get the band onto kind of neutral ground, and have them hostage so they couldn't go anywhere and be distracted.
"But also visually I wanted to create a sense of unity, I wanted to do something ... something cinematic and evocative and lyrical. And ultimately it also echoed Grant, in his upbringing in North Queensland, [the song] Cattle and Cane and the whole pastoral reference."
Fleetwood Mac minus the fame

The Go-Betweens famously seethed with relationship tension. Robert and Lindy were an item, and then they weren't. Lindy became a little infatuated with young violinist Amanda Brown and brought her into the group; Amanda and Grant became lovers, their relationship ending only when Grant announced he and Robert were leaving the band. They were like Fleetwood Mac, complete with the great songs and the drugs, only without the commercial success.
Remarkably, Stenders got them all to talk.
The key relationship, though, was always the one between Robert and Grant. Did Forster's recent memoir Grant & I help or hinder or in any other way inform the film?
"I think the book works in parallel, it's a companion piece to the film," Stenders says. "I didn't want to make a film based on the book because I wanted to cover things it didn't. I wanted it to be everyone's story.
"But they're very different things. Robert's book is a memoir, and it's his story. 'This is what I remember.' The film is a little more democratic."
Australia Day screens on August 5 and 7.The Go-Betweens: Right Here screens on August 5 and 6. The Age is a Melbourne International Film Festival partner.
