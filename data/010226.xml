  <title>Ferocious fire engulfs recently sold home on Sydney</title>
  <content>
It took six teams of firefighters to take control of a ferocious fire that engulfed a recently-sold home on Sydney's Lower North Shore.
Neighbours ran from their homes as firefighters in "defensive mode" worked to battle the blaze and stop the spread at the property on the corner of Lihon Street and Burns Bay Road in Lance Cove West about 6pm yesterday.
Fire and Rescue NSW said smoke from the blaze was "blanketing" the suburb, posing a major traffic hazard to motorists.
"I rushed outside and flames were everywhere. Giant flames," one neighbour told 9NEWS.
No one was inside the property at the time and it is believed the blaze began in the rear of the home.
The home had only recently been sold at auction.
While neighbouring properties were unaffected, the house was destroyed and the roof was left partially collapsed.
