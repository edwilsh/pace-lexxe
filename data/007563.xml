  <title>Tree-mendous outcome for historic river red gum</title>
  <content>
HUME Council has moved to allay the fears of environmentalists who were barking up the wrong tree.
The  had been concerned a river red gum more than 150 years old was going to be chopped down as part of a residential development at 605 Mickleham Rd, Greenvale.
But Hume planning and development director Kelvin Walsh said the council's permit approval was granted on the condition the tree was protected and retained by future owners or developers.
The Victorian Planning Authority's  also identified the tree for protection.
Planning approval has been granted for a nine-lot subdivision on the 2ha site.
AWPC spokeswoman Eve Kelly said increasingly significant and historical trees were being cleared around Melbourne suburbs.
Ms Kelly said the river red gum had several hollows, which provided nests for protected wildlife, and when these trees were lopped it meant certain death and suffering of the native animals.
