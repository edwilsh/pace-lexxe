  <title>Reserve Bank holds interest rates at record low 1.5pc </title>

The Reserve Bank of Australia has signalled greater discomfort with the appreciating Australian dollar which it sees challenging its expectations for growth and jobs.
Board members left the overnight cash rate steady at 1.5 per cent for  on Tuesday.
"The higher exchange rate is expected to contribute to subdued price pressures in the economy. It is also weighing on the outlook for output and employment," the August policy statement said. "An appreciating exchange rate would be expected to result in a slower pick-up in economic activity and inflation than currently forecast."
This is a departure from July's statement, when it commented: "An appreciating exchange rate would complicate this adjustment," with regard to the transition away from mining investment.

JPMorgan strategist Sally Auld believes this paves the way for a pushing out of forecasts for target growth and inflation, which will be updated in Friday's statement on monetary policy.

"They're basically saying a stronger currency hurts inflation and it's not great for growth or employment," Ms Auld said. "The numbers will probably stay the same, but what we could see on Friday is pushing back the time. That's interesting because you're not downgrading forecasts, you're saying it's taking longer to get there." 
This also justified - albeit not sustainably - the RBA's willingness to maintain its current settings, she argued.
It was akin to saying, "the economy's going to grow below trend for longer and for the time being we're okay with that, because we've got other things to worry about like financial stability".
The Reserve Bank inadvertently fuelled speculation of interest rate hikes when it revealed in the minutes of its July 4 meeting that the economy's neutral rate . But governor Philip Lowe firmly shut down talk of tightening in a speech last week, where he declared that the RBA would not be hurried by other central banks which are raising interest rates, because Australia's monetary policy response was not as extreme.

"Just as we did not move in lockstep with other central banks when the monetary stimulus was being delivered, we don't need to move in lockstep as some of this stimulus is removed," .
, the latest figures show, removing any impetus to cool the economy.
"A factor working in the other direction is increased competition from new entrants in the retail industry," Tuesday's statement noted, .
Ahead of Tuesday's meeting, traders were pricing in a 52 per cent chance of a hike for May 2018. The Australian dollar was fetching US80.2¢, rallying after another weak session for the out-of-favour US currency. The Australian dollar briefly slipped below the US80¢ level when the decision was released, before recovering to US80.37¢.

For now, the Reserve Bank remains firmly on hold as it awaits a pick up in inflation and fresh evidence that a regulatory crackdown on risky bank lending is curbing the build-up of debt. Most economists see the cash rate unchanged heading into 2018.
