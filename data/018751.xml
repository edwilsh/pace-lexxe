It's a rite of passage for many school children in Canberra to host international students.
The latest is Daramalan College in Dickson which paired with its sister school in Kochi, Japan called the Kochi Gakugei School. Together they run an annual student exchange program.
Twenty  Japanese teenagers arrived in Canberra on Friday  to experience a week of typical Aussie education. This will include subjects as diverse as Australian cooking to the history of Aboriginal art.
Daramalan has had Japanese as part of the curriculum for many years and the parents and students are strongly supportive of these annual visits, which go a long way in increasing the understanding and acceptance of different cultures and traditions."
