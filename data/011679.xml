  <title>Veteran reporter Laurie Oakes to retire</title>
  <content>
Canberra press gallery veteran Laurie Oakes is set to retire after a career spanning more than 50 years reporting on Australian politics.
The Channel Nine reporter and three-time Walkley Award-winner will sign off for the last time from television screens on August 18, a few days after his 74th birthday.
"The story that caused the biggest stink, I suppose, was in 1980 when the entire budget was leaked to me two days before then treasurer John Howard was due to deliver it," Oakes told the Nine News website.
