BREAKING: A TAXI driver has been arrested after crashing into traffic lights in the Cairns CBD.
The man was taken to the police station after the incident at the corner of Buchan St and Spence St about 4pm today.
Three juveniles were seated in the back of the vehicle and fled the scene.
Witness Patrick Roberts said he chased the young kids and brought them back.
He said the driver was breathalysed and handcuffed.
