  <title>The BBC's New Font Is Mobile Friendly And A Money Saver</title>
  <content>
Who thought developing your own font would be a money saver? The BBC has created a new typeface called BBC Reith, named after the broadcaster's founder. As well as being specifically designed to work best on mobile devices, it will save the Beeb a few bucks on the balance sheet.

According to a  at The Verge the fonts in the current style guide - Gill Sans, Arial, and Neue Helvetica - aren't optimized for mobile displays and cost the broadcaster in licensing fees.

This has me thinking - how many of us have corporate websites that aren't paying the appropriate licensing fees? And what would it take to create your own typeface?

Have you done this? Are you a typeface/font designer?
