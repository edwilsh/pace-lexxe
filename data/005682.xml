  <title>Major drug bust nets 23 alleged offenders</title>
  <content>
NORTH Queensland police have charged more than 20 people and seized cash, drug crops and utensils as part of a suspected trafficking operation.
Ingham detectives and the Northern Major and Organised Crime Squad (MOCS) on Tuesday closed an operation targeting the suspected trafficking of illicit drugs.
Operation Oscar Aurum began in October last year and identified a number of people allegedly involved in a drug syndicate operating in Ingham.
Over Monday and Tuesday, officers from the Ingham Criminal Investigation Branch, Northern MOCS, the Townsville Tactical Crime Squad and the State Intelligence Group finalised the operation, which saw 23 people charged with 80 drug-related offences.
Drugs with a street value in excess of $150,000 were seized and included ice, cannabis and steroids.
All of those charged will appear in Ingham Magistrates Court over the next month.
Detective Acting Inspector Jason Shepherd said the result was a good one for the Ingham community.
"I would like to thank the assistance provided by the community to the QPS throughout this investigation," Detective Acting Inspector Shepherd said.
"This result is a testament to the collaboration between police and the community - we cannot fight this issue alone."
