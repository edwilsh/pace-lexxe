Betts, Crouch and Lever are all chances of facing Port Adelaide on Sunday. Lever has missed the past two games with what the club says is a minor hamstring injury.

Travis Varcoe

Season

Updated: Tuesday, August 1

Early prognosis

Young Daicos' hopes of making his AFL debut before season's end have taken a hit after he sustained a foot injury in the VFL. More finger surgery means Pendlebury might not be seen again this season, while Varcoe definitely won't play again this year after undergoing elbow surgery. - Ben Collins

Updated: Tuesday, August 1

Early prognosis

Merrett is set to miss the rest of the season after breaking his leg in last week's VFL win. The speedy wingman/forward hasn't played at senior level this season. Green is expected to be available after missing two weeks with a hamstring injury, while Brown is still touch and go to be available again in 2017. - Callum Twomey

Matthew Uebergang

Updated: Thursday, July 27

Early prognosis

Langdon's knee continues to plague him and the youngster could miss another two weeks after twice making short-lived comeback bids since round 10. Pearce and Clarke strode out in run-throughs at training on Tuesday, along with Duman who is a few weeks from a WAFL comeback. Walters has avoided surgery on his injured knee, but will not play again this season.  - Travis King

Early prognosis

This list is growing by the week. Ablett, May and Witts will have to get through tests during the week, while Ah Chee and Sexton will go through the concussion protocol. Matera's foot problem has lingered longer than the Suns had hoped, but this might be the week he returns through the NEAFL. - Michael Whiting

Updated: Tuesday, August 1

Early prognosis

Johnson, Mumford and Setterfield will all need to be monitored during the week, with the trio all likely to try and train at the club's main session on Wednesday. A decision on the pair of veterans might come down to how they pull up on Thursday. Taranto is back running in a good sign for the draftee. - Adam Curley

Ben Stratton

Season

Updated: Tuesday, August 1

Early prognosis

The Hawks expect Hardwick to play against the Tigers given he was borderline to return to the ground last Friday and will be bolstered by the return of Puopolo this week. Gibson and Frawley will also likely play again this season, while O'Meara's long-awaited return appears just one week away. - Ashley Browne

Season

Updated: Tuesday, August 1

Early prognosis

Waite will spend a fourth stint for the year on the sidelines, including a third from injury, because of a second calf setback, while Williams and Wright join the long list of players done for the season. Wood will also miss at least a fifth match, after some initial optimism of a swift return. Larkey is a chance to return at AFL or VFL level, while Preuss did not appear on the club's official injury list despite hurting his back at the weekend. - Marc McGowan

Player

Injury

Estimated Return

 

Chad Wingard
Ankle
1-3 weeks
 

Updated: Monday, July 31

Early prognosis

Wingard has been ruled of this weekend's Showdown as he recovers from a high ankle sprain, but could return for the round 21 clash with Collingwood. - Lee Gaskin

Updated: Tuesday, August 1

Early prognosis

Riewoldt will find out on Thursday morning if he is available to play, with his fate in doctor's hands after having several stitches in his right eye. Prestia should be available after being rested with knee and calf soreness. Morris has been sidelined for five matches with a hamstring injury and is due to push his case for a return, likely through the VFL. - Nathan Schmook

Koby Stevens
Groin
Test

Updated: Tuesday, August 1

Early prognosis

Saints coach Alan Richardson was last week "really hopeful" McCartin would be back this weekend, with not many hurdles left for the forward to jump over. Stevens missed last week with a sore groin but could return. Armitage didn't play in the VFL last week after experiencing groin soreness. Coughlan re-injured his hamstring and faces more time on the sidelines. - Dinny Navaratnam

Early prognosis

Kennedy, Rohan and Naismith all missed training on Monday, but Lloyd and Reid managed to do some running and light skills work. The Swans won't make a call until they see if the players can get through training on Wednesday. - Dinny Navaratnam

Daniel Venables
Toe
Indefinite

Updated: Thursday, July 27

Early prognosis

The Eagles have lost star midfielders Priddis and Jetta for Sunday's clash against the Lions, while Lycett still hasn't recovered from his shoulder injury and could be done for the season. Venables' turf toe injury remains an issue. The top draftee was listed as three weeks away last round, but is now indefinite and looks doubtful to return this season. Willie Rioli (hamstring) and Simon Tunbridge (ACL) both got through comeback games unscathed in the WAFL reserves on Saturday. - Travis King

Updated: Tuesday, August 1

Early prognosis

First-year ruckman English is likely to be available for Saturday's clash with the Brisbane Lions after pulling up well from a heavy knock in the VFL. Forward Stringer is a week away with a hamstring concern. Premiership midfielder Dunkley could resume in the VFL after a serious shoulder injury.  - Ryan Davidson
