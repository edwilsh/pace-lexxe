  <title>Trainer's Affair to remember</title>
  <content>
IT'S a long way from Kembla Grange to Coffs Harbour but it was a worthwhile trip for trainer Paul Murray who quinellad today's Coffs Harbour Gold Cup.

Darci's Affair, starting from the outside barrier, was too strong down the straight to edge out stable mate Gold Horizon with Glitra finishing third ahead of the fast finishing local hope Youwaitandsee.

Murray was full of praise for Australia's winningest jockey Robert Thompson who again proved what a genius he is, getting the win from the extreme outside barrier.

"He (Thompson) had to use him (Darci's Affair) a little bit to get him across and I didn't expect the other horse to be where he was," Murray said.

The shocked trainer said today's feature event wasn't part of the original plan for the Darci Brahma gelding when the current campaign was being mapped out.

"We set him for the South Grafton but he just needed that second outing and he was spot on for today," he said.
