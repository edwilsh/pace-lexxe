  <title>Three plead guilty to Sydney terror plot</title>
  <content>
Two men and a teenager have pleaded guilty to plotting a terrorist attack on government buildings in Sydney.
Jibryl Almaouie, 23, and Sulayman Khalid, 22, on Monday at a Supreme Court matter heard in Parramatta pleaded guilty to planning an act of terror in late 2014.
Another person under 18, who cannot be named, also pleaded guilty to the plan, which centred around carrying out attacks on government buildings, including police headquarters, with firearms.
Almaouie, Khalid and the teen are among six involved in the plot - with the other three having pleaded guilty earlier this year.
