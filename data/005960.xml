  <title>Local newspapers in north-west Victoria prove there's life still left in print</title>

Everybody knows newspapers are facing hard times, as readers and advertisers move online.
But in some rural communities, small independent publications are bucking the trend.
Toni Domaschenz bought the West Wimmera Advocate in 2014 for about $80,000. The paper is based in Edenhope, a town of fewer than 1,000 people in the far west of Victoria.
"One of the reasons I bought the paper is it's so loved," she said.
"It'd been for sale for about four years and I heard pretty good rumours it would close by the end of the year.
"I'd always wanted to move home but I wasn't sure I'd be a farmer. It was a chance to use the skills I have, learn something new and come home."
The paper is a one-woman operation: Domaschenz writes stories, takes pictures and sells advertising for the Advocate, which is published each Wednesday.

It is printed in South Australia. Her partner Kieran does a three-hour round trip to pick it up, usually returning to a line of locals waiting at the post office to purchase a copy.
"It's something to look forward to each week," retiree Clare Ryan said.
"I am interested in the deaths, of course, and births and so forth, but not the sport."
Another local, PJ Clarke, has been a devoted reader for 40 years.
"All the people that are in [the newspaper] that I know I always speak to them," he told Lateline. "They don't reply."
His wife, an avid reader of news online, laughs at him for still reading a printed product.
"But when she gets home from work it's one of the first things she does."
'There's no wondering about feedback'

The Advocate sells about 700 copies across the West Wimmera Shire.
For Domaschenz, with five children in the household, it is not always easy juggling work and home life.
"I work until 2:00am on a Monday, I work until about midnight on a Tuesday and then I try and recover for a couple of days before spending the next few days looking for stories," she said.
"There are many challenges. One is that if someone is unhappy they walk in and tell me. There's no wondering about feedback.
"I encourage them to write letters to the editor because that would fill up space. Sometimes that's one of the challenges - filling the paper."

Emily Gladdis bought the Nhill Free Press five years ago, after first working there as a journalist.
"I grew up in a very small town that only has a newsletter, not a newspaper," she said.
"I've set my life up here. I enjoy giving the news to everybody. I have people still dropping [tips] in my mail box at home."
Three reporters cover stories in Nhill and nearby Kaniva and the weekly paper has a circulation of about 1,300.
"If there are visitors to the town the first thing they do is buy a local paper to see what's on in the town," Joy Gurry from Nhill Newsagency said.
Editor takes her kids along to cover events

The paper is a key source of information in the region.
"With the changes that have been happening with more regional papers, where there's less staff, less photographers and so on, we wouldn't see the same coverage here because they simply haven't got the capacity to come out to the small country towns," Hindmarsh Shire's Anne Champness said.
In addition to sales, the Free Press is supported by advertising from local businesses.
"The majority of our revenue would be from advertising," Gladdis said. "We have a good support base from the township; some [businesses] do weekly, monthly, some do fortnightly adverts."
She said her most memorable story was when a local football team reached a grand final.
"We didn't win that year but the excitement of not winning at football was big news," she said.
Gladdis usually takes her two small children with her to cover news events.
"I'm enjoying being able to grow my family as well as running our business," she said.

Paper's core business remains the printed product

David Ward has been editing the Warracknabeal Herald since taking over from his father more than three decades ago.
"I love the family history," he said. "My son Andrew is our production manager and my daughter is with us with sales. They're fifth generation."
Ward publishes three local newspapers, employing more than a dozen people.
"It's very reliant on the seasons - some seasons are really buoyant, and other seasons are down a fair bit, but we're still going."
The Warracknabeal Herald is one of the few regional newspapers still printing on-site.
The 1970s Goss Suburban Press operates five times a week to print the three papers.
"There's certain things you've got to cover sensitively," he said. "I wouldn't say we wouldn't cover it if it was topical and newsworthy at the time [but] you tend to try and avoid sensationalising things.
"You've got a responsibility to the community to be including the community rather than excluding and divisive."
The Herald is published online, and the paper has a Facebook page, but Ward said those were not core to the business.
"Our core is the printed newspaper and we're still selling lots of newspapers."
