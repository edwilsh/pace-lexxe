  <title>Acting Melbourne fire chief quits</title>
  <content>
Acting chief officer Paul Stacchino has quit the Metropolitan Fire Brigade in another blow for the agency amid a major restructure.
The MFB on Tuesday confirmed Mr Stacchino had resigned from the position, which he's held since former chief Peter Rau stepped down due to illness in 2016.
Acting CEO Russel Eddington said Mr Stacchino has "helped steer the organisation through some challenging times" but did not provide a reason for the departure.
