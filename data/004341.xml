  <title>At least 52 ANU students sexually assaulted in university setting last year, survey reveals</title>
  <content>
A national survey by the Human Rights Commission has found 3.5 per cent of Australian National University (ANU) students were sexually assaulted on campus last year.
The sexual harassment and sexual assault figures for the ANU, one of Australia's leading universities, were .
Nationally, 1.6 per cent of survey respondents reported being sexually assaulted in a university setting (including while travelling to or from university) in 2015 or 2016.
ANU's survey results show the rate for the Canberra campus was double that, with 3.5 per cent (or 52 respondents) claiming to have been sexually assaulted on campus last year.

Sexual assault support services:

ANU Counselling Centre: (02) 6125 2442 (9:00am - 1:00pm and 2:00pm - 4:40pm)
Canberra Rape Crisis Centre: (02) 6247 2525 (7:00am - 11:00pm)
National university support line: 1800 572 224 (until November 30, 2017)
1800 RESPECT: 1800 737 732
Lifeline: 131 114
Beyond Blue: 1300 224 636

More than a third of ANU students who responded to the survey also reported some form of sexual harassment on campus, compared with a quarter of students nationally.
Vice-chancellor Brian Schmidt described the results as shocking and apologised to the victims.
"To every member of our community who is affected and who is suffering because of it, I say to you, you do have our support," Professor Schmidt said.
Professor Schmidt said in 74 per cent of the incidents of sexual harassment, the perpetrator was another student and in 5 per cent of incidents it was a lecturer or a tutor.
He also said 82 per cent of harassment reports involved men as the perpetrators.
While the announcement was being made a cohort of students, some of whom had experienced sexual harassment or assault, protested outside about the culture of the ANU.
Some students had tape over their mouths, which they said represented "survivors and survivor advocates who had been silenced by the university".
ANU announced earlier this month that students would have access to a .
They also said yesterday that the university was  after the "shocking" and "ugly" picture of the problem at the ANU was revealed.
