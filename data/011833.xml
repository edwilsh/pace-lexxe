  <title>Players will be keen to stay at Falcons with coach: captain</title>
  <content>
RUGBY LEAGUE: Sunshine Coast captain Dane Hogan says many Falcons players will be eager to stay at the club next season, to work under re-signed coach Craig Ingebrigtsen.
The respected mentor will be at Bokarina for at least another year, after inking a contract extension.
And that's an exciting prospect for those within the team.
"With him going around again, I think a lot of us boys will be keen to play on underneath him," Hogan said.
"He's a good strategist but probably his best asset is the relationship he has with the boys and his communication.
"I probably haven't played underneath a coach (like Ingebrigtsen) that can get the boys up for a game week-in week-out."
Ingebrigtsen steered Easts to two grand finals in the state league before linking with the Falcons at the end of 2015.
He made an immediate impact, taking the team from 12th to third in 2016 and the side is second this season with finals looming.
"His results speak for themselves," Hogan said.
"He's a pretty good coach and I think a lot of the boys would think that and it's good to see he's signed on for another year."
Hogan, who has played in the NRL with the Cowboys, followed Ingebrigtsen from Easts to the Sunshine Coast.
The tough forward admitted he's likely to remain at the Intrust Super Cup club next season, with the coach's presence a big factor in his decision.
"I'm loving my footy on the Sunshine Coast at the moment and I love living up here so I dare say I'll be going around again next year up here."
