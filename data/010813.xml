  <title>ICAC finds Former NSW ministers corrupt</title>
  <content>
Three former NSW Labor ministers engaged in serious corrupt conduct, the Independent Commission Against Corruption has found.
Tony Kelly, Eddie Obeid and Joe Tripodi were found to have engaged in corruption, according to findings from ICAC's investigation, which were released this morning.
The long-awaited report into the controversial water infrastructure company Australian Water Holdings made no corrupt findings against federal senator Arthur Sinodinos.

The trio of former ministers were found to be corrupt in relation to their actions concerning a public-private partnership proposal by the water company, the ICAC found.
The inquiry, codenamed Operation Credo, investigated the connections between members of jailed former Labor minister Eddie Obeid's family and the water infrastructure company.
It also laid bare Australian Water's ties to high-profile Liberal figures, including Sinodinos, a former non-executive chairman of the company and prominent Liberal Party fundraiser Nick Di Girolamo.
