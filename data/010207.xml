IT appears another Bachelor love affair may be over.
Speculation is mounting Richie Strahan and Alex Nation have called time on their relationship, 10-and-a-half months after he
When contacted by phone last night, a downcast Strahan danced around the issue and refused to shut down speculation that the couple had broken up. Nation too was silent, not responding to calls for comment.

There has been radio silence online from the pair, who previously posted regular images together on social media. And they've not been seen together in public since the Logie Awards in April.

While Matty Johnson is currently wooing women on the new season of The Bachelor, the show has had a mixed degree of success in previous seasons.
