Orazio pings his hammy
The Dons forward gun is out of the game with a hamstring injury

ESSENDON forward Orazio Fantasia could be facing an uphill battle to play if the Dons make finals after suffering a suspected high-grade hamstring injury on Saturday.

Fantasia, 21, pulled up sharply after hurting his right hamstring in the first quarter of the Bombers' clash with Carlton at the MCG.

He was running at full pace along the wing when the injury happened, and clutched at the hamstring before hobbling off.

A dejected Fantasia shook his head as he went down into the rooms for treatment.

He returned to the bench a short time later with ice on his leg and a tracksuit top on.

Leading sports medico Dr Peter Larkins told 3AW the injury looked to be "high grade".

The Bombers are looking to cement their place inside the top eight with a big win over the Blues, which could leave Fantasia with just four weeks to get himself right if he's to figure in potential finals action.
