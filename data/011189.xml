  <title>NSW police get new protective vests</title>
  <content>
NSW police will be fitted out with new light-armour vests to protect them from bullets and stabbings.
The move follows a similar rollout in Western Australia in July when frontline officers received stab-proof vests as part of new safety measures.
NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller and Police Minister Troy Grant will announce the rollout of the new vests on Thursday.
