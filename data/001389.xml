  <title>Paddlers compete in gruelling Molokai channel race</title>
  <content>
PADDLING: A selection of tough Sunshine Coasters endured the gruelling Molokai 2 Oahu World Paddleboard Championships on Monday.
A handful were right in the thick of the action too, with top-10 results.
Lachie Lansdown and Cameron Cole were sixth and seventh amid the men's prone division, clocking 5hrs8min13sec and 5:09.29 respectively.
They finished behind Matt Bevilacqua, who claimed his third straight victory in the 53km race at Hawaii, clocking 4:29.20.
Meanwhile, Sunshine Coast young gun Laura Pettigrew was sixth amid the women (7:33.26) and first in her division, behind ironman Harriet Brown (5:14.15).
Brown eclipsed the record of Noosa's Jordan Mercer, which was set in 2011.
Mercer, the six-time reigning champion, was unable to take to the start line this year due to a fractured arm.
Amid the stand-up paddlers, Lincoln Dews was sixth (4:20.46) in the men's field.
