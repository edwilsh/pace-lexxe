Ricciardo's choice words after he's taken out by Verstappen

The Australian crashed out early after colliding with his Red Bull teammate.

Ricciardo blasted the 19-year-old a "f-----g sore loser" and immature over the incident in what appeared to be an attempt to pass.

"Yesterday was hard to take. You build up all day for those couple hours of racing and then it's gone like that," Ricciardo tweeted.
"Max apologised to me after the race and we spoke one on one away from media or anyone.

"The situation was handled and taken care of in the right way to move forward."

"We've effectively lost Daniel and the same move has given Max a penalty and compromised his race, so from a team point of view it's really frustrating," Horner told Sky Sports.
"He [Verstappen] made a mistake today and it was costly to him, for the team and for Daniel.
"Dan had the corner, he should have conceded."
Verstappen offered an apology immediately after the race.
Despite failing to finish, Ricciardo maintained fourth spot on F1 championship standings with 117 points.
He has a one-point buffer from fifth-placed Kimi Raikkonen and is 85 points behind leader Sebastian Vettel.
The next race will be held in Belgium on August 27.
