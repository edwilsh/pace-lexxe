  <title>Minter Ellison's turn at Ten</title>
  <content>
There is a new set of lawyers involved in drafting up documents for Ten Network's pending sale. 
Street Talk understands Minter Ellison has been hired to work on the mooted sale alongside financial adviser Moelis & Co and receiver PPB Advisory. 
It's just the latest in a long line of appointments at Ten, with different sets of advisers working on different generations of the deal over the past six months. 
The latest set is charged with selling the company on behalf of Ten lender Commonwealth Bank of Australia, who took control of the situation

From all reports, there is considerable initial interest in the free to air television network. 

Nine parties are said to have signed non-disclosure agreements and be in receipt of the information memorandum, with first round offers due in late August. 
Tyrekickers include US studio CBS, hedge funds Anchorage Capital Group and Oaktree Capital Management and entities owned by Ten shareholders Lachlan Murdoch and Bruce Gordon are among the interested parties.
