  <title>Turnbull in a bind on marriage vote</title>
  <content>
One of the Turnbull government's most senior moderates has cautioned colleagues contemplating crossing the floor over same-sex marriage to think twice about the consequences.
Threats have been swirling around Malcolm Turnbull's leadership, the coalition agreement with the Nationals, and conservatives defecting to the crossbench should backbenchers force a vote in parliament to allow same-sex marriage.
West Australian Liberal senator Dean Smith is working on a marriage equality bill while his lower house colleagues Trevor Evans, Tim Wilson and Warren Entsch have been discussing options with colleagues.
But cabinet minister Simon Birmingham, a moderate who has long supported marriage equality, issued a caution on Wednesday.
"It's always been ... a right in the Liberal party for individual members to exercise their conscience from the backbench if they choose," he told Sky News.
"But equally, it is, of course, a right that people should exercise carefully, with caution and with consideration for all of the consequences."
The suggestion people might defect from the Liberals was "completely ridiculous".
His warning was echoed by conservative MPs, including Ian Goodenough, who told The West Australian all members should consider party discipline and ensure they "look after the team".
Tasmanian senator Eric Abetz - a staunch opponent of same-sex marriage who would vote against it even if a plebiscite showed support - warned it was a "grave matter" for any government to lose a procedural vote in the lower house.
In September, at the end of the first sitting after the election, the government lost a series of procedural votes as Labor attempted to force debate of a royal commission into banks.
Those MPs pushing for marriage equality argue they have discharged their duty to support a plebiscite and it's not their fault the Senate blocked the legislation.
"I did my best to get the plebiscite through. But be under no illusion, irrespective of what you call it, any form of plebiscite is dead, cremated and cannot be resurrected," Mr Entsch writes in News Corp Australia.
Minister Zed Seselja says that is nonsense, pointing to the government's persistence over workplace relations laws.
"We didn't turn around in that case and adopt Labor policy and nor should we in this case," he told Sky News.
Queensland's Liberal National Party president Gary Spence made a similar argument in a letter to members late on Tuesday after the party's state conference passed a motion calling for a postal plebiscite.
"I am disappointed that views that do not accord with the party's policy have been aired publicly," he wrote.
"I am equally disappointed that members elected under the LNP banner have chosen to take a position that defies LNP policy and the wishes of the LNP's membership."
Mr Turnbull has reportedly called Mr Evans and Senator Smith, urging them to support the government's plebiscite policy.
He reiterated on Wednesday morning the plebiscite remained government policy.
"It's a pretty straightforward issue," he told WA radio station Triple M Albany.
