  <title>Xmas games still on Big Bash agenda</title>
  <content>
PLANS for a Christmas Day Big Bash event and even a Christmas Eve match remain on the table despite missing out as part of a beefed-up fixture for this summer which starts earlier and extends in to February.
As cricket's pay war moved perilously close to conclusion on Monday night, amid a consensus over the sharing of extra cash set to flow from a new BBL TV deal, no-one at Cricket Australia was prepared to push too far on the festive season days.
The Herald Sun revealed last December
Franichses including the Sydney Thunder expressed interest in playing on Christmas Day and while BBL boss Anthony Everard said the Cricket Australia board gave the go ahead to explore the option, it wouldn't happen this year.
"We will continue to gauge the interest of clubs and explore new avenues for the competition," Everard told the Herald Sun.
The BBL teams are currently in a holding pattern for signing new players with an embargo in place until the new Memorandum of Understanding is finalised.
It's believed up to half the available quota of international player spots has been filed among the eight franchises, with the likes of Kevin Pietersen already signed on a multi-year deal by the Melbourne Stars.
But more big-name additions and other player movement will take place once the new MOU is agreed.
Key elements of this year's fixture include eight more regular season games, taking the total to 40. The Melbourne Stars will get to play five games at the MCG.
The location for three games are yet to locked in, including the Melbourne Renegades clash with the Sydney Sixers on January 3, which is likely to be at Geelong.
And with each WBBL team playing 14 games, there will be more than 100 total games this summer.
The end of the WBBL season could also clash with the start of the AFLW competition.
Last year cricketers Jess Cameron and Emma Kearney juggled their football commitments, with Collingwood and the Western Bulldogs respectively, and Everard expects their desire to play both codes won't be severely impacted.
