A series of free film making workshops are hoping to encourage young people to get creative and enter the Green Flicks film competition.
The short film competition is open to 12 to 24-year-old living in Wollongong, Shellharbour, Kiama or the Shoalhaven.

Entrants needs to tell a story about the environment with a theme of "change" to share in a $5000 prize.

For extra help free film-making workshops will run on Tuesday August 8 (Blackbutt Youth Centre, 4.30-6.30pm) and Tuesday August 15 (Shoalhaven City Arts Centre, 4.30-6.30pm).
Across the weekend a mural was painted in Wollongong's McCabe Park to inspire young minds to get involved in the competition.

"We're hoping that the creativity on display this weekend will get people talking, sharing ideas and motivated to submit an entry," said Simon Tedder from the Office of Environment and Heritage.
