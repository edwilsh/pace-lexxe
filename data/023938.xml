BUDDING Queensland astronomers should set their alarm for the early hours of Tuesday to catch a partial lunar eclipse.
About 10 per cent of the moon will be covered by the earth's shadow at about 4.20am on Tuesday, said Kingaroy Observatory astronomer Jim Barclay.
The lunar eclipse will start at approximately 3.20am and ending at 5.18am.
"It will be about 10 per cent of the moon being slightly shadowed," Mr Barclay said.
"It will be visible from all over Queensland. It will only be a small portion but it's worth seeing."

Bureau Of Meteorology forecaster David Grant said it should be a clear sky when the lunar eclipse is at its peak except for possibly along the north tropical coastline.
"It will be clear across the majority of Queensland," Mr Grant said.
"The only piece of cloud cover that could be around would be along the north tropical coastline. That's north of Cardwell, toward Cairns and Cooktown and the Lockhart River."
Mr Barclay said those who forget to set their alarm need not worry as there are more significant eclipses occurring in 2018.
"There are two total lunar eclipses. One on January 31 and another on July 28," he said.
