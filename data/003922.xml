  <title>Man 'dry-retched' after Gateway Motorway death: court </title>
  <content>
A "distraught" New Zealander dry-retched on the side of a busy Queensland motorway after a man he had punched in the face was fatally hit by a truck, a court has heard.
Tamate Henry Heke, who has pleaded not guilty to one count of manslaughter as well as to an alternative charge of unlawful striking causing death, allegedly struck Shane Merrigan before he was hit by an oncoming truck on the Gateway Motorway at Eight Mile Plains on December 1, 2015.Photo: AAP Image
A motorist told his Brisbane Supreme Court trial on Tuesday she saw a "Maori" man punch a Caucasian man in the face, then grab his head, pace up and down, and dry retch after the collision.
