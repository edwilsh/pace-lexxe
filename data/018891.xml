  <title>Exports will continue growing: Palaszczuk</title>
  <content>
The Queensland and federal governments are continuing to trade blows over Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk's proposal to prefer local businesses for goods and services.
Federal Trade Minister Steve Ciobo labelled the move to give Queensland businesses weightings of up to 30 per cent in consideration of government contracts, which was announced at last weekend's Labor conference, as "reckless" and potentially damaging to international trade.
But Ms Palaszczuk said 80 per cent of all extra export dollars earned since 2015 have come from Queensland and exports would continue growing.
"Getting advice from Mr Ciobo about growing trade would be like Laurie Daley telling Kevvie Walters how to win State of Origin," she told AAP on Saturday.
Ms Palaszczuk said Queensland's exports, worth $65.9 billion, were declining when she came to office.
"We have turned that around and it's helped generate 77,300 new jobs," she said.
