  <title>HIGH-RISE MEGA-PROJECT: $200m deal pushes new CBD ahead</title>
  <content>
BREAKING: A memorandum of understanding struck between the Sunshine Coast Council, SunCentral, John Holland Group and the University of the Sunshine Coast to stake a $200 million claim in the new Maroochydore city centre.

Five 'super lots' across about 1.4ha in precinct three will be transformed into a high-rise civic centre, with the Sunshine Coast Council to establish its council chamber, customer service and office space on the site.

Mayor Mark Jamieson confirmed the council would be a "key tenant".

Details of the memorandum of understanding are still to emerge with negotiations ongoing.

University of the Sunshine Coast vice-chancellor Professor Greg Hill confirmed his institution was also eager to establish a campus in the new CBD, with the development ideal for teaching, research and student accommodation facilities.
