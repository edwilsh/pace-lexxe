THE youngest of the Lohan family has returned to the spotlight in a massive way - as a supermodel for cult fashion magazine Vogue.
Dakota, the 21-year-old model who goes by the nickname Cody, has only recently returned to the public eye with his sister Lindsay gushing over her youngest brother's photoshoot for Vogue China.

The 31-year-old actress tweeted out a photo to her 9.3 million followers which pictured her brother modelling an oversized knit and the same bright, red hair that set his sister apart over two decades ago.
Proud of my little brother in Vogue China
While Cody's feature in Vogue China pictures the youngster all grown up, it definitely isn't the first time Lohan has modelled.
For New York Fashion Week way back in 2006, Cody strutted the catwalk for Child Magazine with Lindsay watching her brother in the front row.

Ali Lohan, 23, has also modelled for years after her mum Dina Lohan signed her to Ford Models at the age of three.
And just like Ali entered the world of modelling through family influence, Cody also recently revealed it was his showbiz family that encouraged the youngest of the Lohan family to try his hand at modelling.
"My family gave me the push. I'm a student and a surfer - I've always put both of those interests first - but it was my family and their support that gave me the confidence to undertake modelling. We've always been in the spotlight, but some of us have chosen to live a more private life. I think there's a way to balance both and I look forward to the challenge,"  in December last year after he
Cody signed with the international modelling agency, which represents everyone from Gisele Bundchen to Karlie Kloss and the Hadid sisters, back in March, 2016.
