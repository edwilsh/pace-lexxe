  <title>Trump-Russia: Donald Trump jnr's statement was 'true': White House</title>
  <content>
Washington, DC: The White House says US President Donald Trump had a role in a statement in which his son denied a meeting with a Russian lawyer was related to the 2016 presidential campaign, but a spokeswoman insists the statement is true.
"He certainly didn't dictate (the statement)," said White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders on Tuesday, "but ... he weighed in, offered suggestion like any father would do."

Trump 'weighed in' on son's statement

The White House confirms the President had a role in his son's statement, in which he denied a meeting with a Russian lawyer was related to the 2016 presidential campaign.

"The statement that was issued was true and there were no inaccuracies in the statement," Sanders said, even though emails later released by Donald Trump Jr. showed that the subject of the meeting was to be possible damaging information about Trump's rival for the presidency, Democrat Hillary Clinton.
The Washington Post reported on Monday that Trump's advisers discussed the statement about the meeting and agreed that Trump Jr should issue a truthful account of the episode so that it "couldn't be repudiated later if the full details emerged".

But the president, who was flying home from Germany on July 8, changed the plan and "personally dictated a statement in which Trump Jr said he and the Russian lawyer had 'primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children'", the Post said, citing unnamed people with knowledge of the deliberations.
Trump Jr released emails in July that showed he eagerly agreed last year to meet a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Clinton as part of Moscow's official support for his father.
