  <title>BREAKING: Gladstone local crowned fittest woman on earth</title>
  <content>
CROSSFIT: Gladstone's Tia-Clair Toomey is the fittest woman on earth.

After two previous successive runner-up efforts to Iceland's Katrin Tanja Davidsdottir, Clair-Toomey went one better and announced herself as the new Reebok CrossFit Games 2017 world champion.

The event was held in Wisconsin in the US and Toomey's dream was realised after an epic battle with fellow Australian Kara Webb of Brisbane.

Webb had caught up and the final discipline came to the 89 foot lunge with 2 35-pound kettlebells overhead.

With enormous pressure on Toomey, she was no-repped, but she showed her mental strength.

Toomey, who is also the CrossFit Gladstone trainer with her coach and fiance Shane Orr, and Webb both dived across the line at the same time and the end result was anyone's guess.

CrossFit Games director Dave Castro brought the two Australian women together and after a tense few minutes, he announced Toomey as the winner.

Just six points separated Toomey and Webb at the end of the four-day competition.

"Ten times better. Like 100 times better," Toomey said on the The CrossFit Games site when asked whether it was better than Olympic Games selection.

Close friend and CrossFit Gladstone employee Kristian Brodie, who has been coaching in Toomey's and Orr's absence, said it was like a dream come true.

"I have been friends with them for years and I was just ecstatic and it was extremely nerve-wrecking," Brodie said.

In what seemed like an eternity, Brodie described the final few moments as anxious.

"There was a lot of thought going through and when Castro called out her name and pointed to her as the winner, it was just unbelievable," he said.
