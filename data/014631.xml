  <title>Champions! Matildas rout Brazil</title>
  <content>
THE Matildas have claimed their first trophy in seven years after a 6-1 destruction of Brazil at the Tournament of Nations.
Australia needed just a draw to claim the inaugural edition of the tournament after a giant-killing run, but suffered an early scare when Brazil opened the scoring in the second minute.
But the Matildas quickly assumed dominance and a first half double to Lisa De Vanna - which made her our country's all-time leading scorer with 42 goals - set up a 4-1 lead at the main break.
Caitlin Foord and Katrina Gorry were the other first half goal scorers - and the fun continued in the second.
Foord made it 5-1 and a personal brace by collecting the ball on a breakaway, rounding the goalkeeper and tapping into an empty net.
Sam Kerr was unplayable for most of the game and after being involved in the lead-up to several goals nabbed one for herself to make it 6-1 during the 81st minute. She showed impeccable control to chest a long ball down into her path before poking it past the keeper.

Football: Brazil have scored in the first 68 seconds of their match against the Matildas.

Brazil score in 68 seconds
The rout of the eight-ranked Brazilians came after wins against world No. 1 USA and No. 6 Japan earlier in the tournament.
With two major tournaments in the next two years, a squad full of promise now has the proof of its progress under coach Alen Stajcic.

✔️ 1st win over world No.1 🇺🇸
✔️ Biggest win in 32 years over 🇯🇵
✔️ Biggest win over 🇧🇷 ever
✔️ 11 goals champs:

It will also give the Matildas' world ranking a boost - which will assist in seeding for both the 2018 Asian Cup and 2019 World Cup. The Matildas last hoisted a trophy at the 2010 Asian Cup.
The Australians wore black armbands in respect to legendary football broadcaster Les Murray, who died on Monday.

Les, thank you for fighting for our sport, today we fight for you. Let's go ladiessss 💪🏽
Hayley Raso, who assisted Kerr for the first goal in Australia's 4-2 win over Japan, said pre-game the Matildas wouldn't lack for motivation against Brazil.
The Brazilians knocked Australia out of the 2016 Olympics at the quarter-final stage. "It wasn't the best result so I think there will be a little bit of extra motivation," she said.

Football: Caitlin Foord's second goal has given the Matildas a 5-1 lead and secured the win for the Australians.

Foord puts nail in the coffin
With a goal of consistent efforts front and centre of his mind, Stajcic said he wanted to see a third-straight performance from his team.
"If we want to win World Cups and Olympic Medals we need to put four or five games together," he said.
"Two is good. We have to be a team that string together five or six. Then we can be a contender."
