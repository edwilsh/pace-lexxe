A BODY found on the rocks at Nobbys breakwall at the weekend has been identified.
Detectives identified the man on Monday and will seek to contact the 56-year-old's next of kin.

Police confirmed they are not treating the death as suspicious at this stage, but a post-mortem on Tuesday will reveal more.
The man's body was discovered on Sunday. Authorities quickly closed the breakwall as a crime scene was established.

Meanwhile, there were no suspicious circumstances deemed after another grisly discovery in Carrington on Monday, with police finding a body in a car at the boat ramp on Tully Street shortly before 9am.

A report will be prepared for the coroner.
