  <title>Tas union calls for PTSD law changes</title>
  <content>
Tasmania's largest health union is calling for legislative change to make it easier for paramedics to access post traumatic stress disorder compensation.
The Health and Community Services Union (HACSU) has submitted a discussion paper to the state government and wants the burden of proof under the Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act shifted from workers to employers.
"Unfortunately our members see and experience trauma every day. Presumptive legislation will be a step towards normalising discussion about mental health," HACSU state secretary Tim Jacobson said, adding changes would help avoid legal conflicts.
