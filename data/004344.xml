BREAKING 1.20PM: TWO men are in custody following what Rockhampton Police believe is the biggest alleged drug bust in Central Queensland history.

Rockhampton police allegedly caught two 36-year-old males with 5kgs of the drug 'ice' in their vehicle in a Rockhampton McDonalds drive-thru.

Rockhampton Police Criminal Investigation Bureau officer-in-charge Detective Senior Sergeant Luke Peachey said the two men were travelling to Brisbane when they were caught in the George St McDonalds drive-thru at 4am today.

Det Snr Sgt Peachey said the seized drugs have an estimated wholesale value of about $900,000 and says it is the biggest seizure in CQ history that he has seen.
