  <title>Clive Palmer dismisses a push to freeze his assets as a 'political witch-hunt'</title>
  <content>
Former federal MP and businessman Clive Palmer has labelled an attempt to freeze his assets a political witch-hunt and says it could entice him to re-enter the political fray.
In a surprise move, lawyers acting on behalf of Commonwealth-appointed seeking an injunction to restrain Mr Palmer from selling or spending hundreds of millions of dollars in assets.
Mr Palmer told media outside court, he was beginning to think he should again stand for election.
"This is the sort of case, the sort of thing that tempts you to get back into politics, because this is a wholly political exercise against me," he said.
"If you have a look at support for me generally, as a brand around Australia, it probably runs between five and 10 per cent.
"I'm sure that's what the Liberal Party polling is telling them."
The move is an attempt to claw back almost $70 million in taxpayer funds paid to when the refinery collapsed last year.
The application applies to 21 defendants, including Mr Palmer and his nephew and former QNI director, Clive Mensink.
Mr Palmer represented himself in court and argued the matter should be delayed because Mr Mensink and four other overseas defendants had not been served legal documents.
Authorities have been unsuccessful in trying to contact Mr Mensink and he is the subject of an arrest warrant issued by the Federal Court.
Mr Palmer told today's hearing he had not heard from his nephew since February and told the court he believed he had left Australia for good.
Justice John Bond said he thought it unlikely Mr Mensink had "no knowledge" of what was going on and decided he could be served via his lawyers and Mr Palmer.
"So the proposition you're wanting me to accept is that despite the things that are happening in court Mr Mensink is swanning about the world uncontactable by us ... or people acting for him and he's not likely to contact anyone?" he said.
Mr Palmer replied: "His attitude seems to be that he's left Australia for good."
Barrister Shane Doyle, who appeared for the special purpose liquidators, wanted the matter heard as early as Friday.
Justine Bond ruled Mr Mensink could be served the lawsuit in his absence.
The hearing continues.
