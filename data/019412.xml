  <title>Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey go into battle for Stephen King's Dark Tower</title>
  <content>
Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey fight it out in a good-versus-evil battle over the fate of the universe in their respective roles as the Gunslinger and the Man in Black in the movie adaptation of Stephen King's best-selling book series The Dark Tower.

But the first meeting between the two stars was not quite so dramatic. "Weirdly enough, Matthew and I met at the Golden Globes in the bathroom," Elba says of the awards in Los Angeles. "We were both in the toilet and I looked over and saw Matthew and he looked over and I said to him 'The water is cold today' and he said 'And deep', and that was it! I have no idea why I'm telling you this story," he adds, chuckling, "but I'm just glad I finally got to work with him!"The Dark TowerPhoto: Sony Pictures
The career of the 44-year-old English actor who is the only child of African immigrants has skyrocketed since his breakthrough roles in the television series The Wire (2002-08) and Luther (2010-15). And after appearing in blockbuster films such as Thor, Prometheus, The Jungle Book and Beasts of No Nation, Elba recently made his directorial debut with the coming indie drama Yardie. What's more, he is criss-crossing the globe as a top DJ, a passion he discovered at 14 when he began helping at his uncle's wedding DJ business. He DJ'd last year at a packed gig at the Sydney's Goodbar club in Paddington while he was in Australia filming Thor: Ragnarok, and when we catch up, he has just returned from a gig in Ibiza, Spain.
"DJs really need to understand what is going on with the energy in the room when you play music," Elba says of his unlikely combined career path. "Similarly, as an actor, I use that empathy to really evoke emotion from my characters, and it's interesting that it's almost the same thing as when I'm DJ'ing and asking, 'What song is everybody in this room going to enjoy?'."Photo: Jessica Miglio
In The Dark Tower, Elba's Roland is the last Gunslinger standing after his eternal nemesis, Walter, the Man in Black, has killed his father and wiped out the rest of those guarding the Dark Tower, which holds together the universe. Hopeless and alone, he finds his purpose again when a young boy (Tom Taylor) with visions of doom tracks him down and they try to stop Walter from bringing down the tower.
Danish director Nikolaj Arcel (The Royal Affair) admits to being a passionate fan of the book series since childhood and stayed in close email contact with Stephen King throughout the arduous shoot in South Africa's barren Karoo desert and Cedarburg mountain range, as well as during the green-screen work on sound stages in Los Angeles. "We traded emails constantly and he was very supportive," Arcel says. "The greatest day was when he wrote me that he'd seen the film and he was very happy with it, because I know he hasn't always felt that way about movies based on his books."

Ironically, Arcel cast two leading actors who had never read the books. "But when it was presented to me," Elba says, "I saw it as an opportunity to make something new."

As Elba leans back in a folding director's chair on the rooftop patio of a boutique hotel in Manhattan, New York City, McConaughey joins him for a joint interview and the chemistry between them is fun and playful, in contrast with their characters in the film.The Dark TowerPhoto: AP
McConaughey is asked if he watched Harry Potter films for tips on playing "pure evil" and replies: "I chose not to go towards Voldemort, although I'm a fan of Professor Snape. But I looked at things where there was fun to be had, like Malcolm McDowell in A Clockwork Orange, and I came up with the philosophical jumping off point that people that are really evil, like Hitler, don't think they are evil; they think they are enlightening people, and that is what is so evil about them."
Elba briefly met King on set and seems chuffed that "he was so complimentary and supportive of me playing one of his most beloved characters". McConaughey emailed him before filming began. "He wrote back one very succinct sentence: that Walter has the world on a string and a Cheshire grin along the way," McConaughey says. "And that was all he felt he needed to let me know, and that was all I really felt I needed at the time."Photo: AP
Elba says he wasn't concerned about being unfamiliar with the series. "Nikolaj was like an encyclopedia so we were in good hands. There are a lot of remakes and a lot of reboots, especially in the sci-fi/fantasy world, but it's very rare that something comes along that's original, so I was excited I got the chance to play a character so reimagined, because all the imagery of the Gunslinger shows him as a blonde-haired, blue-eyed, white, Clint Eastwood-type in a cowboy hat, and it was a bold move to put a black actor in that role."
Arcel says he also enjoyed casting the Oscar-winning McConaughey - a 38-year-old Texan - against type as Roland's evil nemesis. "Matthew is usually seen as a handsome leading man, so it seemed so atypical for him to do this kind of part. He was initially hesitant but became really excited when I told him he was basically playing the devil. He had a lot of fun playing the personification of evil."The Dark Tower
King's career has spanned 50 years and more than 80 books but The Dark Tower has long been considered at the centre of his canon, full of references that have spilt over into many of his later books. He has said in the past that he was inspired by blending together three unlikely sources: J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Sergio Leone's 1966 spaghetti western film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, with Clint Eastwood, and the 1855 Robert Browning poem Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came.
Since 2007, the project had stalled, shifting from a movie trilogy starring Russell Crowe to a single movie that at one point had director J.J. Abrams attached. Now the film has the potential to not only become a franchise but will also spin off into the TV series Castle Rock, still being overseen by Abrams and encompassing characters from The Dark Tower and other King stories in its own universe, akin to the worlds of Marvel and DC. Elba confirms he is also likely to make an appearance in the TV series, which will focus on the origins of the battle between Walter and Roland.Photo: Sony Pictures

"In my mind this is the pinnacle of both television and film working together," says the actor, who is also now equally known for both mediums. "What could be better than that?"

The Dark Tower opens in cinemas on August 17.
â€‹IN THE KING'S REALM

Stephen King began writing The Dark Tower books aged 22 and described them in a recent interview as "the centrepiece of my fictional universe, with characters who show up in other books or characters from other books showing up in [Tower's] Mid-World, too". He has had more than 57 books adapted into films or television shows, but The Dark Tower film pays homage to the great author by offering Easter eggs that King fans can look out for. The film includes references to: 

It (book published 1986) - The Dark Tower's young Jake Chambers (Tom Taylor) finds the ruins of an amusement park named after Pennywise the Dancing Clown, the favourite form of the shape-shifting evil in that book. That personification of evil is also known as the Crimson Tide, an entity that is referenced in The Dark Tower.
The Shining (1977) - Jake is dealing with visions and nightmares of other dimensions, which turn out to be a psychic ability known as "the shine", in reference to The Shining. In the office of Jake's therapist is a framed photo of the Overlook Hotel as seen in Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film.
Shawshank Redemption (1982) - In one scene where the Gunslinger leans at a door next to a poster of actress Rita Hayworth, it references the wrongly convicted Andy Dufresne (played in the 1994 film by Tim Robbins) using the same poster to hide the escape tunnel he's digging.
Cujo (1981) - In a street scene, a couple are seen walking their St Bernard dog past the Forbidden Planet comic shop in New York in a homage to the novel about a rabid dog trapping a mother and son in their car.
Christine (1983) - One of Jake Chambers' toys is a red, 1958 Plymouth Fury, the same make and model as the bloodthirsty vehicle from the book about a teenager and his possessed ride.
Mr. Mercedes (2014) - A malicious smiley face left on the wall in Jake's room after he's taken by the Man in Black is a reference to the calling card used by the serial killer in that novel.
Misery (1987) - Watch closely and you'll see the Man in Black is a fan of the fictional book Misery's Child, written by author Paul Sheldon (played by James Caan in the film) before crazy fan Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) kidnaps him.
