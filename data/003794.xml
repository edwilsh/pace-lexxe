  <title>CLP to increase consultation in effort to recreate image after crushing election defeat</title>
  <content>
A boost to fundraising, tighter vetting of candidates and restrictions on former members running again are measures being considered by the Northern Territory Country Liberals Party (CLP) as part of a review of its crushing election defeat last year.
The ABC has been provided with a copy of the draft recommendations, some of which have already been made public, but there are others which have received less attention.
One idea that has already caused a stir is the proposal that MLAs who served in the former Mills and Giles CLP government be "discouraged" from seeking preselection in future elections.
"Central council must exercise an active role of undertaking a forensic examination of the suitability of candidates submitted by the branches," the review stated.
"Those former members of the CLP parliamentary wing who defected to the crossbenches and stood as independents against endorsed CLP candidates not be invited to re-join the CLP.
"Former members of the Mills and Giles government who lost their seats should be discouraged from standing for pre-election for future elections."
While the party may want to draw a line in the sand with the division and scandal that surrounded the former government, excluding all the former MLAs would reduce the experience of any new field of CLP candidates.
New party director Brad Vermeer emphasised the recommendations were preliminary, and still needed to be discussed by the party's central council in September, when the full review would be presented to members.
"Hopefully at the other end we'll have a set of priorities and a set of goals that we can work to right up to the next election," he said.
"We are focused now on making sure our preselection processes are as stringent as possible."
While in office, several CLP MLAs defected to the crossbenches and then ran against CLP candidates last year.
A number of those independents have said they have no intention of re-joining the CLP, and the review suggests they should be blocked from doing so.
The list of draft recommendations also includes a code of conduct for candidates, which is still being drafted, and that the CLP central council does a "forensic examination of the suitability of the candidates submitted by the branches".
"We're focused on looking for people who want to work for Territorians not for themselves, people able to work in a team and are able to contribute to a team," Mr Vermeer said.
"The Country Liberals are focused on the future and putting forward a new fresh face and showing we've learnt the lessons of the past to Territorians."
Leadership increasing consultation with the party

The review also proposes a evaluation of the party's policies, and suggests membership and recruitment drives and broader community participation in the party.
It also recommends the party accept the responsibility to recruit Indigenous members "as a priority".
It also proposes fundraising be considered an "immediate priority" to help the party successfully contest the next election.
The party has faced scrutiny over its links to the .
Mr Vermeer said the fundraising measures being considered did not include setting up an associated entity.
Under another idea, the parliamentary wing would have to consult central council before agreeing to any changes under the Electoral Act.
During the term of the former Country Liberals government, the electoral law was changed to exclude candidates and their supporters from canvassing votes within 100 metres of a polling booth.
"Those things were brought in without a large amount of consultation of the organisational wing of party," Mr Vermeer said.
He said since the election, the parliamentary members Gary Higgins and Lia Finocchiaro had generally increased consultation with the rest of the party.
