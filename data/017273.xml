  <title>Apple's months-long AirPod shortage is finally starting to end</title>
  <content>
Apple's futuristic wireless earbuds, AirPods, have been hard to find since they first went on sale last December.

Previously, if you ordered a pair from Apple.com, it would take six weeks to arrive at your door, although some Apple stores and other retailers had stock from time-to-time.

"We have increased production capacity for AirPods and are working very hard to get them to customers as quickly as we can, but we are still not able to meet the strong level of demand," Apple CEO Tim Cook .

Seems like the increase in production capacity is working - MacRumors  on Friday that AirPods now show a four week waiting period , the first reduction in wait time since they went on sale.

They still cost $US159. If you're not sure you want to wait a month,  about how to find and buy a pair without waiting.
