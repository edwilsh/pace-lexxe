Corey Maynard will make his debut for the Demons against the Giants

FORMER basketballer Corey Maynard will make his debut with Melbourne on Saturday against Greater Western Sydney.

The midfielder, who joined Melbourne this season as a Category B rookie after playing college basketball in America and representing Australia at junior level, has been in outstanding form in the VFL.

He was a travelling emergency for last week's game against North Melbourne.

Melbourne coach Simon Goodwin said it was exciting for the Demons to name a player to debut for such a crucial game at this stage of the season

"He has really developed nicely during the year and played some strong VFL footy," Goodwin said.

Maynard, who is the brother of Collingwood defender Brayden, will be the fourth player to make his debut for Melbourne this season.

The Demons will also bring back co-captain Nathan Jones and Bernie Vince and are weighing up whether to include Sam Weideman or Cam Pedersen to replace Jesse Hogan who fractured a collarbone last Saturday against the Kangaroos.
