  <title>Bell Potter raids Canaccord's corporate finance unit</title>
  <content>
Bell Potter has swooped on three members of Canaccord's corporate finance team. 
Bell's staff were told of the hires on Tuesday. They have picked up Canaccord's executive director investment banking Matt Storey and ECM execution and advisory staff Leon Dowman and William Hughes. 
The trio will start at Bell after a period of gardening leave. 
A memo to Bell staff, obtained by Street Talk, said: "It's exciting for the Bell Potter business and no doubt will add significantly to our overall origination and broader corporate capability. 

"It is also in keeping with Colin Bell and Alastair Provan's philosophy that Bell Potter is a growth business and we are always open to the idea of adding quality people throughout the organisation when the opportunity presents."
