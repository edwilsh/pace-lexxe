  <title>Aussie team to honour Cuthbert</title>
  <content>
AUSTRALIAN athletes will wear black armbands to honour Betty Cuthbert for the remainder of the world championships.
The IAAF approved the mark of respect while a minute's silence also took place inside the Olympic Stadium before the start of last night's session.
More than 50,000 fans stood as one as a moving tribute with photos of Cuthbert's career appeared on the large scoreboards.
GOLDEN GIRL:

I am so sad to hear of the passing of Betty Cuthbert. She was as a giant in our sport and someone I always admired...

Australia's 2012 Olympic hurdles champion Sally Pearson who spent time with Cuthbert after her career triumph tweeted: "I am so sad to hear of the passing of Betty Cuthbert. She was as a giant in our sport and someone I always admired."
Marathoner Jess Trengove spoke on behalf of the Australian team.
"Betty was a legend of the sport and Team Australia extends our sympathies to her family and friends at this sad time," she said.
"You can be sure that the green and gold will be doing all that they can to honour her legacy here in London. She was one of the best we've ever seen compete for Australia and she inspires athletes to this day when they put on the national uniform."
Lauren Wells was the only Australian in action last night but the 400m hurdles veteran failed to progress.
Lining up in her fourth world championships, Wells struggled into seventh place in a time of 56.49 sec.
