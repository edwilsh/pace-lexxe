  <title>Teen left hanging upside down in bungee jump gone wrong</title>
  <content>
A teenager has been left dangling upside down for at least 20 minutes in a bungee jump gone wrong.
Roger Rodriguez, 19, has said he will never bungee jump again after he was suspended 10m above the ground on Wednesday night at a California county fair.
"I was about to pass out," Mr Rodrigues told the Ventura County Star.
Ride operators say it was a mechanical failure that prevented them from being able to pull Mr Rodriguez back up or lower him down.
The teen said he began to get a headache as he waited for emergency crews to arrive.
The Ventura Fire Department eventually got Mr Rodriguez back to the ground using a ladder.
Two fair goers who were trapped in the steel bungee box above were also rescued.
