CUP Day is not just about fashion, fun and sipping champers in marquees, there is also some excellent horse racing. If you're not a regular punter, this basic betting lingo should get you over the line.
What is a "win" bet?
A win bet pays when your chosen horse finishes first in a race
What is a "place" bet?
A place bet requires your horse to finish first, second or third in a race
What is an "each way" bet?
Each way betting is a combination of win and place bets. If your horse finishes first you collect both the win and place dividends. If your horse finishes in second or third place, you still collect the place dividend.

This requires you to select the winners of two nominated races. Each of the two double races is known as a leg. Double bets must be placed before the commencement of the first leg.

To win a trifecta bet you need to have correctly selected the horses that finish in first, second and third place in a race.
