Fairfax Media photographers from the Hunter have been chosen among the best in Australia ahead of the annual PANPA awards this year. 
Shooters Max Mason-Hubers, Marina Neil and Jonathan Carroll were all shortlisted in the prestigious newspaper industry awards. 
Neil is a shortlist in the community portrait section for her images of six-year-old Kody O'Brien, who Fairfax Media reported last August needed a $20,000 device to help stop his seizures. 
Mason-Hubers received two nominations in the regional news section, for his photography in the wake of Bernie Sessions death and the Hard Grime festival at Maitland gaol. 
Carroll's football photography is up for the regional sport category, while his Space Cowboy series of interstellar slow captures also stood out to judges in the regional features and lifestyle section.

Fairfax Media's Hunter mastheads also received recognition in the hotly contested newspaper and website of the year divisions. 
The Newcastle Herald is shortlisted for both regional daily newspaper of the year and regional news site of the year, while the Maitland Mercury will contend in the non-daily community newspaper of the year category. 
The Singleton Argus is also a finalist for its Kids in our Community liftout in the pre-print or supplement section of the awards, while the Newcastle Herald's Beresfield printery is a regional finalist in the technical excellence section. 
The PANPA awards will be held in Darling Harbour on September 6.
