  <title>Work for dole scheme racist: union chief</title>
  <content>
Australia's top union official is expected to step up her attack on the federal government's work for the dole scheme, labelling it a racist policy that unfairly targets remote indigenous communities.
In a speech to the Garma Festival on Sunday, Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary Sally McManus will say the controversial Community Development Program denies participates living in remote regions, 85 per cent of whom are Aboriginal, the same basic workplace rights afforded to other Australians.
"The discrimination of the Community Development Program is a stark reminder that systemic racism endures," she is expected to tell the festival in northeast Arnhem Land.
"The workers are being paid $10 per hour - way less than the minimum wage of $18.86, with no rights, no leave, no superannuation, no workers compensation."
Since Ms McManus was elected as the first female union chief in March, she has ramped up a national campaign against the $1.5 billion initiative, which covers more than 35,000 mostly Aboriginal people.
Jobseekers must do 25 hours of work per week, 52 weeks per year, to receive welfare payments, which is up to three times longer than other unemployed people.
"For non-remote programs, it's 15 hours a week, six months of the year. And CDP workers, in our poorest communities, are being fined at a rate 70 times higher than metropolitan work-for-the-dole programs," Ms McManus will say.

The coalition government has come under fire for issuing more than 200,000 fines to CDP workers who breach their requirements since it began in July 2015. A review is underway.
This year the ACTU set up the First Nations Workers' Alliance to represent CDP participants, who it says are being exploited by businesses for free labour in jobs that were once paid award wages.
A spokesman for Indigenous Affairs Minister Nigel Scullion said under the scheme jobseekers living in the biggest cities and remote communities have mutual obligations of up to 25 hours work per week.
The minister's spokesman said a new CDP model will be developed in partnership with Aboriginal groups and introduce weekly payments, top up arrangements to better support the transition to employment and more funding for local community activities.
