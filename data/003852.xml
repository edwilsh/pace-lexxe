  <title>Desert volunteer program finds 'stand-in grandparents' for outback children</title>

It is almost 700 kilometres to the nearest large town and over 100 kilometres to the house next door, but for the Warr family, 'Ethabuka' is home.
Matt and Amanda Warr have managed Bush Heritage Australia's Ethabuka Reserve for the last two-and-a-half years.
Situated 60 kilometres east of the Northern Territory border, on Wangkamadla land in the Simpson Desert, Ethabuka could be considered one of Australia's most remote stations.
For the young couple, life in the desert is like nothing they had previously experienced.
"It can be challenging at times," Mrs Warr said.
"From where we've grown up [in Stanthorpe], we were in a climate where if you went a few months without rain you were in drought, and to come out here we didn't have any rain for the first 18 months. It's definitely a different experience."

A cattle station come nature reserve

Unlike many of its neighbouring stations Ethabuka Reserve is cattle-free, and operates as a haven for desert wildlife.

"In one way it's sort of still like a cattle station - we still have to do all of the maintenance work of boundary runs, fencing, grading tracks for bush fires, but at the same time we get the added bonuses of seeing and experiencing the native animals," Mrs Warr said.
Managing the vast 215,500-hectare reserve is not something they do alone.
For eight months of the year, volunteers make the journey to Queensland's west to help the young couple with the reserve and their children.
"They're wonderful couples. Most of them are retired, and they come out for four weeks at a time," Mrs Warr said.
"Some of them they've come back a couple of years in a row ... [and] they sort of become like family."

Becoming quasi-grandparents

Grant Irving and wife Kim are one couple that have been so transfixed by Ethabuka, they've returned for three years in a row.
Life in the desert is a far cry from their rural Victoria home of Mirboo North.
"It's dairy country with a bit of potato growing. It rains a lot. There's a lot of green hills," Mr Irving said.

But for Mr Irving, the remoteness of Ethabuka is half the fun.
"I think of the adventure and the stark contrast to our day-to-day life."
"Life out here is pretty basic. It's not complicated by any means. It's a matter of surviving in the elements, and that's very attractive," he said.
"The remoteness and isolation is quite addictive."
But aside from the big sky country that Mr Irving finds so attractive, he is also drawn back by the chance to reconnect with the Warr family, who have since become close friends.
"Matt and Amanda are very similar ages to Kim and my children, and it's interesting to see their life - raising small children in such a remote area," he said.

Mr Irving said watching Isabella, 3, and Madeline, 2, grow had become a real highlight.
"My wife and I  - we don 't have grandchildren yet - so in some respects they are quasi-grandchildren."
Mrs Warr agreed.
"Our kids don't get to see their grandparents very often. Maybe twice a year for about three or four days, so it is nice having somebody can call their adopted grandparents."
Not only do the children benefit from contact with the volunteers, Mrs Warr said she and her husband also thrived off the new friendships.
"Having someone to stand there and have a chat with while you're making Worcestershire sauce instead of standing there by yourself. It's lovely."
But while life in the desert may seem like an isolating lifestyle, Mrs Warr said she thought it made her 'one of the lucky ones'.
"We're not sending our kids to daycare. We're doing everything together and I just love this place. It's a beautiful part of the world."
