  <title>Moeen Ali bags hat-trick as England takes series lead</title>
  <content>
CRICKET: England has taken a 2-1 series lead after a hat-trick from Moeen Ali completed an emphatic win over South Africa in the third Test at The Oval.
The off-spinner became the 13th Englishman to achieve the feat when he ended the match on day five in London with the wickets of Dean Elgar and Kagiso Rabada at the end of one over before snaring Morne Morkel lbw on review with the first ball of his next.
England won the game by 239 runs ahead of Friday's final Test  at Old Trafford.
It was the first time in nearly 60 years that a Test has ended with a hat-trick, with Australia left-arm wrist-spinner Lindsay Kline the last bowler to finish a match in similar fashion, against South Africa at Cape Town in 1957-58.
Ali's hat-trick was also the first in The Oval's 100-Test history.
