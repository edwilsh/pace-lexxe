A KAHIBAH man accused of robbing a man of more than $2000 and dragging him alongside his car for about 50 metres at Horseshoe Bend on Saturday has been refused bail.
Mason Thomas Webb, 25, of Hamilton Street, appeared in handcuffs in Toronto Local Court on Monday charged with aggravated robbery and inflict actual bodily harm, good in custody suspected of being stolen and cause bodily harm by misconduct.
He did not enter any pleas. 
Mr Webb was arrested on Sunday, about 24 hours after a man was allegedly robbed of $2200 in cash and assaulted in Owen Street, Horseshoe Bend.
According to court documents, the alleged victim suffered abrasions to his right leg, right shoulder and bleeding and bruising to his nose, mouth and right ear when he was allegedly dragged along the outside of the passenger side of a vehicle for about 50 metres before he fell to the roadway. 
Police allege Mr Webb was driving that vehicle. 
He applied for bail, but it was refused by Magistrate Allan Railton, who cited the seriousness of the allegations.
