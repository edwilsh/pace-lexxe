  <title>Flight diverted, road warning as fog hits city</title>
  <content>
COMMUTERS are being urged to slow down and turn on their headlights as thick fog engulfs many parts of the city.
The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a road weather alert for the Melbourne area due to reduced visibility making conditions dangerous.
There are also reports of flight delays at Melbourne Airport, with one Qantas flight diverted.
Sarah Fulton from Airservices Australia confirmed the fog is causing delays and diversions from Melbourne but the airport remains open despite earlier reports it had been closed.
Ms Fulton said some Melbourne-bound flights had been diverted to Sydney due to the low visibility.
"In particular it is the domestic and smaller regional aircrafts that are being affected," Ms Fulton said.
"Most international aircrafts have been able to arrive and depart the airport because they have more advanced technology," she said.
Airservices Australia urged passengers travelling in or out of Melbourne airport today to check with their individual airline regarding delays.
A Melbourne Airport spokeswoman said flights were operating in and out of Tullamarine despite the reduced visibility.
The State Emergency Service advises people to reduce speed and maintain a greater distance between them and the vehicle in front on them.
Motorists are also urged to turn on their headlights.
Dean Stewart, a forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology said light winds and clear skies overnight had contributed to the thick fog this morning.
"It's quite extensive across the Melbourne metro area," he said.
The thickness of the fog varied across the city with Melbourne Airport experiencing visibility as low as 200m, Mr Stewart said.
"It looks like the fog will last quite a while this morning before it turns into low cloud later in the day," he said.
There is also a frost warning for most areas of Victoria.
Once the fog lifts the sun will return with a top of 15C expected later today.
Melbourne experienced glorious sunshine yesterday as it welcomed the month of August.
The mostly sunny day reached a top of 15C and had Melburnians out and about catching the warm rays.
The remainder of the week is also looking brighter with average temperatures of about 15C but showers forecast for the weekend.
Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Dean Stewart said August was expected to be a drier month than usual. "There is an increased chance of below average rainfall across the state for August," he said.
