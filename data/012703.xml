  <title>Man charged over Noll firework saga</title>
  <content>
A man has been charged for allegedly throwing a firework on stage during a Shannon Noll concert on the NSW mid-north coast.
Noll was performing at the South West Rocks Country Club on Friday when the firework was thrown his way.
Police said a band member attempted to put out the wick with his foot, but it exploded and burnt a hole in his shoe.
He also suffered superficial burns to his foot and was taken to Kempsey District Hospital.
"I'm all about having fun at a show but tonight was completely idiotic!" Noll posted on Facebook following the gig.
"I hope security caught the dickhead who threw it!"
A 27-year-old man was charged with affray and negligently handling an explosive, police said on Thursday.
