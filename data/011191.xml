  <title>Vic train passengers get explosion scare</title>
  <content>
Passengers have rushed to the back of a Melbourne train when its power line connectors exploded during the morning commute, leaving them stranded.
Two videos show what looks like flames and smoke coming from the roof of the train, which is stopped near Flinders Street Station, but a Metro Trains spokeswoman said there was no fire.
"The train has never been on fire, the MFB have left," she told AAP.
"It was an overhead wire issue, it was electrical, the train was not on fire."
Firefighters arrived after the train's power connectors exploded first at 7.21am, and then again about 20 minutes later.
Metro has helped passengers to walk off the train, and the train behind it.
"We are currently assisting passengers off the train, the train is still there so we anticipate around 45-minute delays on the Sandringham line," the spokeswoman said.
