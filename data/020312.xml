  <title>Samo shows the way for GPS</title>
  <content>
THE remarkable Radike Samo and his ageless afro worked for nine hours concreting on Saturday before providing the cement for a smashing major semi-final boilover for GPS at Ballymore on Sunday.
University's serene 15-1 run through the season was upended by Samo's physical edge and the example it set for the rest of an inspired GPS side chasing the club's first premiership since 1996.
The former Wallabies forward is 41 but is still full of feared, old school hardness. How many pampered modern players would have worked a day job pouring concrete for nine hours from 5am on match eve?
Samo produced a dominant 80 minutes with bullocking runs, thumps in defence and the final barging try after being considered a 20-minute super sub at best when the season started.
"It's kind off hard to retire. I thought about it but I love playing," Samo said.
"Training just twice a week I can do it being at home with the family a lot.
"You play semis like there is no second chance and it's always an awesome feeling to be part of a win, especially with a young team."
Just as a more physical Brothers side derailed Uni at the end of last season, the more abrasive Jeeps have upset Uni twice in three weeks and the students seem befuddled at how to respond.
Uni must rebound in Sunday's preliminary final at Ballymore against Sunnybank, who knocked out Wests 24-22 after the full-time hooter with a scrum pushover try from No. 8 Jeff Faamausili.
Uni were on the attack after pegging back a 10-point deficit, to trail 28-24, when the key moment of the major semi-final arrived at the 67-minute mark.
Centre Nathan Russell was rushed into a spilt ball 10m out by impressive GPS winger Chris Kuridrani, who dashed 45m in counter before positioning fullback Todd Winkley for a similar sprint and the deciding try.
Halfback Nick Frisby, two-try centre Konelio Maaloga and captain Dan Gorman were other standouts for GPS while replacement prop Reuben Leilua's two close-range tries kept Uni in the hunt.
Uni flyhalf James Dalgleish did set up a nice Russell try but was too ragged with his passing and was outshone by opposite James Tuttle.
