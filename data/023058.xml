  <title>China smooths road ahead of Donald Trump's Beijing visit</title>
  <content>
Beijing: Mean tweets and the veiled threat of a trade war put aside, China is preparing to host US President Donald Trump on a visit this year.

Mr Wang said in his meeting with Mr Tillerson that China and the US had avoided conflict for 40 years but acknowledged "some sensitive problems".
With Beijing also set to stage the 19th Party Congress, a key meeting of the Communist Party leadership, in October or November, analysts expect Mr Trump's visit, with the unpredictability it could entail, to come later in November. He is due to visit the Philippines and Vietnam in November.

Chinese President Xi Jinping needs stability and to project the image of a powerful leader at the congress. 
China's decision to back the United States in the United Nations Security Council, delivering a new round of sanctions that will cut $US1 billion ($2.5 billion) in exports from North Korea, has avoided the untimely prospect of a damaging trade battle with the US.

North Korea on Monday condemned the sanctions as violating "our sovereignty and our right to survive and develop", and said it wouldn't negotiate while it was threatened by the US.

Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the sanctions resolution was "a win for China", because it had avoided agreeing to oil sanctions.Photo: AP
"It appears Beijing bought time and averted more sanctions on Chinese banks facilitating North Korean access to the international financial system," she said.

Although China has called for a return to six-party talks with North Korea, and Mr Wang met with his North Korean counterpart Ri Yong-ho at the ASEAN gathering in Manila, she doubts there will be any progress on dialogue before the Trump visit.
"China probably wants to avert more US secondary sanctions. It wants to be portrayed as part of the solution rather than part of the problem," she said.
The sanctions will remove a third of North Korea's foreign currency income, and are the seventh round of restrictions since North Korea's first nuclear test in 2006.
Lu Chao, a Korean expert at Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, was quoted by Chinese media as saying  were the "most serious in history".
Many Chinese companies in Liaoning and Jilin provinces would also be impacted by the seafood ban in particular, he said.
Leonid Petrov, a North Korea expert at the Australian National University, said China had given the appearance it had delivered on its promise to Trump.
Mr Petrov said the extension of the sanctions to cover the sale of iron ore, lead and seafood would impact on Chinese provinces such as Liaoning, bordering North Korea, which may have been conducting trade without Beijing's oversight.
"It sends a signal that they should stop doing it," he said.
Chinese exports of iron ore to North Korea increased 60 per cent in the first half of 2017, jumping shortly after UN sanctions on coal took effect in February.
But a clamp down by Beijing appears to have followed this surge, as Chinese customs data shows iron ore to North Korea falling 10 per cent in June.
Mr Petrov said the ban on fishing exports will bite in North Korea, which had relied on stealing fish from the Chinese, Russian and Japanese exclusive economic zones before selling the poached products back to the same countries. 
South Korean media reported that North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho bumped into South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha at the Manila forum, only to reject the South's offer of reopening talks as "lacking sincerity".
Mr Ri was avoided by Mr Tillerson, who skipped a group dinner attended by his North Korean counterpart.
