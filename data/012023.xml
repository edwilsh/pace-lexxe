  <title>Two Joeys sent home from tournament in Thailand for alleged shoplifting</title>
  <content>
Two Australian youth team players were kicked out of last month's 2017 ASEAN Under-15 championships in Thailand after allegedly being caught stealing from a local shop. 
Fairfax Media understands two youngsters were sent back home to Australia during the tournament in which the Joeys finished third in the East Asian regional titles. It's understood the players were allegedly caught but not detained by police and did not require consulate assistance in Thailand.

Plays of the Week

Nail-biting finishes, ripping yorkers and hat-trick heroes, these are the plays of the week.

The Joeys were based in the coastal Chonburi region of Thailand, where all their seven games were played.
Australia's performance at the ASEAN tournament fell short of expectations as they finished second in their group, losing to host nation Thailand. Australia won their four other games against Myanmar, Laos, Singapore and Indonesia. The Joeys lost their semi-final against Vietnam before salvaging some pride by beating Malaysia in the third place play-off. 
Australia finished with the best attack, scoring 27 goals in the tournament but had the worst defence of any of the teams that reached the knock-out stages, conceding 10 times. 
Fairfax Media has sought comment from Football Federation Australia.
