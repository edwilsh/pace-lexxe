  <title>Paul Pisasale allegedly used council car to visit brothels</title>
  <content>
Former Ipswich mayor Paul Pisasale was driven in a council car to brothels and massage parlours, his former driver has reportedly claimed.
The former driver, Stephen Potts, told  he would drive Mr Pisasale, 65, to massage parlours across Brisbane "two or three times a week on average".
He claimed he drove Mr Pisasale to meet with developers at establishments - in Woolloongabba, Redbank, Tallebudgera, and at Tweed Heads in New South Wales - known to offer young sex workers. 
Mr Potts said he worked for Mr Pisasale from September 2014 until mid-way through 2016, and said he had given the Crime and Corruption Commission Queensland (CCCQ) a detailed account of his allegations.
Mr Potts claimed he drove Mr Pisasale to massage parlour Cloud 9 in East Brisbane on four occassions in 2015, on the first visit following a car belonging to developer Chris Zenonos to the address.
Cloud 9 has been the subject of many complaints about illegal prostitution since 2013 and was raided in 2015.
The developer denied he went inside the shop.
"What's that got to do with me if I went on my own?" he told The Brisbane Times.
