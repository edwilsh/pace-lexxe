  <title>Son's emotional plea after Sydney hit-and-run breakthrough</title>
  <content>
A son has made a tearful appeal to the public to help find the hit-and-run driver who killed his mother
A week before Christmas last year 66-year-old Javaher Rahimi was on her evening walk when she was struck by a car at the intersection of Hawksview and Cecil streets in Guildford.
She sustained serious injuries and later died in Westmead Hospital.
Initially police were told the vehicle in involved was yellow Ford Falcon, but today it was confirmed the car was a yellow Mitsubishi.
Ms Rahimi's son Mohamed Rahimi today described his mother as "the best" and pleaded for the driver to give himself up.
"I tried to ring her phone but nobody answered," Mohammad Rahimi said at the time.

"The third time we rang, the police answered. They came here and they said that unfortunately, my mum had passed away."
