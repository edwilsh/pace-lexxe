  <title>Cadman to step up for Palmerston Sprint</title>
  <content>
THE plan was to start him in the Northern Territory's biggest race, but the $135,000 bet365 Palmerston Cup (1200m) at Fannie Bay tomorrow is a decent alternative.
Merv Rumble's five-year-old gelding Cadman will make his final appearance of the Darwin Cup Carnival when he takes his place in the biggest sprint race on the NT calendar.
The good news is that Cadman is only lumping 54kg in the race. The bad news is that he has drawn barrier 12.
"It's exciting to get a run in the Palmerston Sprint and like every other horse in the race, he's got a chance," Rumble said. "I've put a lot of work into him since we got to Darwin, but he is well and he'll have a good jockey in Felicia Bergstrand riding him in the Palmerston."
Rumble decided to abort plans to start him in Monday's $200,000 Carlton Mid Darwin Cup (2000m) after Cadman's run in the Bridge Toyota Cup (1600m) on July 19, in which he finished fifth.
"He carried 60kg that day and he was in it with about 50m to go, but he didn't go on and it was clear that he had had enough," Rumble said.
"I could have raced him over a mile against weaker opposition in another race before the end of the Carnival, but I'm not complaining about getting a start in the Palmerston.
"However, I had prepared him to run 2000m with the Cup in mind, so adjusting back to 1200m won't be easy - although he has the miles in his legs and he's fit."
Rumble, who is based in Warren, near Dubbo, in country NSW, decided to make the long trip back to the NT once again this year after Cadman's excellent display during the 2016 Darwin Cup Carnival.
Cadman, who has only had 15 career starts, had six starts at Fannie Bay last year from 1200-1300m for five wins and a fourth. He didn't race again until May 1 - Alice Springs Cup Day - where he finished fifth behind Short Shift against a decent bunch of sprinters over 1000m.
It was then off to Darwin where he finished second behind Harrebs Time in the QBE Cup (1200m) on June 17.
That was followed by a surprising 10th behind Unbreakable in the UBET ROANT Gold Cup (1300m) on July 1..
"If Cadman didn't get a start in the Palmerston Sprint, then I probably would have given him a final run in the Darwin Corporate Cup before heading home," Rumble said.
"We've been on the road since March 19 and we've got no runners on Cup Day, so we'll be heading home on Monday."
