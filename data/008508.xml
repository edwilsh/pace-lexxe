A BRISBANE mum has been convicted of assaulting her baby but acquitted of twice trying to kill the five-month-old girl by smothering her.
Ashleigh Meagan Watterson was in the Supreme Court in Brisbane this afternoon at 3.54pm when the 12-member jury returned their verdict on the four charges.
She was found guilty of assault occasioning bodily harm, but cleared of two charges of attempted murder and an alternate charge of causing grievous bodily harm.
She showed no emotion when the verdict was handed down.
