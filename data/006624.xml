  <title>Cape York mob beef up sale</title>
  <content>
CATTLE mustered from remote stations across the Cape York Peninsula have boosted numbers and drove down prices at the Mareeba saleyards.
Road trains filled with steers and heifers delivered 1119 head to yesterday's Prime and Store Sale.
Two major exporters, two feedlotters and a small group of local traders were there to snap up the huge yarding.
Queensland Rural livestock specialist Jacko Shephard said the mixed quality of cattle up for auction was reflected in this week's prices.
"There were some very good bullocks that didn't reach the prices I thought they would," he said. "All in all, the market is still not that bad.
"The producers are just starting to get a break now and I'd hate to see it drop back."
Butcher steers lost 31 cents per kg and butcher heifers dipped 22c/kg.
"Numbers increased ... due to an influx of second and third grade captured cattle out of the Cape and Peninsula area," the report said.
The highest butcher steer snatched 245c/kg as the highest heifer reached 229c/kg.
A pen of prime heifers fetched the best value recorded at 222c/kg.
A pen of 10 charbray cows and calves went for $1400.
