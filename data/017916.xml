  <title>HOW THE LEFT HATES: BANNING MICHAEL DANBY'S ADS</title>
  <content>
How intolerant of debate is the Left?   
Morry Schwartz is publisher of the Leftist The Saturday Paper, which runs the usual Leftist conspiracies and sneers of Miek Seccombe and Paul Bongiorno, among others.
, a pro-Israel advocate on the party's Right. Here's some of it:
Martin McKenzie-Murray to Michael Danby - 1 August 2017
G'day -

I'm the chief correspondent here at The Saturday Paper, and was hoping to put a few questions to Michael [Danby] about Sam Dastyari -

Kind regards,

Marty

The Saturday Paper

Michael Danby to Morry Schwartz - 2 August 2017

Your newspaper won't even take paid advertisements from me!

You refused to publish my insiders account of why Labor passed the metadata legislation when I was a member of the Intelligence Committee.

But when it interests you I'm meant to spill my guts about parliamentary colleagues?

Be fair, reverse your policy of censorship, build a relationship & maybe in 4 or 5 years I'll trust you enough to reply.

Morry Schwartz to Michael Danby - 2 August 2017

Dear Michael,

Sorry you are upset, but if you look at the type and tenor of the ads in the paper, which are harder and harder to get, I think you'll understand why I didn't accept your ads.

As to not accepting your articles, you are not alone. We have limited space and we carefully balance the contents of each issue.

From my side it's all warmth towards you,

Morry

Henderson:
So, The [Boring] Saturday Paper will not accept an advertisement from an elected Labor MP since - allegedly - Mr Danby's advertisements do not fit "the type and tenor" of The Saturday Paper.
Now, what "type and tenor" would that be? - MWD hears you ask. Well, last Saturday's edition contains advertisements for Breguet watches, a leftist Australia Institute conference featuring, et al, Jackie Lambie (yawn), the Queensland Ballet, the Melbourne Festival, the State Library of NSW, Aesop, the Seymour Centre, the Queensland Art Gallery, ABC Books, the Whitlam Institute & Western Sydney University, The Saturday Paper (publisher Morry Schwartz), the Anna Schwartz Gallery and The Monthly (publisher Morry Schwartz). Apart from Breguet, Aesop and the Australia Institute - the remaining advertisements are either from taxpayer funded institutions or Swartz family interests.
Why would running a Danby ad make it harder for Schwartz to get ads from those other sources?
Boy, the Left must really, really hate debate.
But we knew that.
