The region's two major roads will be closed for maintenance on Sunday night.
The M1 between Bulli Tops and Memorial Drive, and Picton Road from the M1 to Wilton Road will both be closed on Sunday night.
The closure will start at 8pm and the roads will reopen at 4am on Monday, in time for the morning peak.
Separate diversions for light vehicles and heavy vehicles will be in place, which will add time to motorists' journeys.
