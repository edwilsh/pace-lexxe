  <title>Northbourne Avenue traffic disrupted as light rail work continues</title>
  <content>
Construction work for the light rail is set to close a Northbourne Avenue intersection overnight for the next month.

Works are typically scheduled between 8pm and 6am each day.
The intersection will be closed to cross-street traffic and right-turning traffic on both streets.
Motorists travelling north or south on Northbourne Avenue won't be affected, and will still be able to turn left from both streets.
The intersection will be closed so workers can install Telstra conduits before the track slab is laid in coming months.

Traffic management measures, including signs and personnel, will be in place to help motorists, pedestrians and cyclists.
No bus stops or routes will be affected as part of this closure.
