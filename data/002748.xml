  <title>Jennifer Lawrence prepares for trouble in the ominous first teaser for 'mother!'</title>
  <content>
Throughout his career, director Darren Aronofsky has loved to look at the darker side of life - whether it's "Pi," "Requiem for a Dream," or "Black Swan."

And it looks like we're in for another horrific story from the Oscar nominee.

The teaser for his anticipated next movie, "mother!" has gone online and it seems to be preparing us for a lot of chilling moments.

The little bit we know about the movie so far is it has an incredible cast - Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris, and Michelle Pfeiffer - and is a psychological thriller about a couple whose lives are interrupted by uninvited guests.

If it's anything like Aronofsky's previous work, expect a movie that will completely mess with your heart (we can't wait!).

"mother!" opens in theatres September 15.
