  <title>SA's diesel generators put out less in extreme heat but nothing to worry about, Treasurer says</title>

The capacity of diesel generators being installed in Adelaide before this summer to stabilise the electricity supply will change depending on the conditions, the state's Treasurer Tom Koutsantonis has said.
"It is completely normal," Mr Koutsantonis said.
"It is a well-known occurrence within electricity generation and what's why we went for a much larger capacity generator because we needed to have more than 200 megawatts (MW) to avoid load shedding and even in cases of extreme heat these generators will provide us more than 200MW."
Earlier this week the South Australian Government announced nine hybrid turbines would initially be installed at two locations, the Adelaide desalination plant site in Lonsdale and the General Motors Holden site in Elizabeth before summer.

Fast facts:

Nine new generators across two Adelaide sites by summer
A permanent location will be chosen at a later stage
Initially diesel with later conversion to gas
Capable of providing up to 276 MW quickly
SA Government will own them
They are emergency back-up to help avert blackouts
Cost not confirmed, but less than $360 million

The turbines will operate on diesel fuel over the next two summers before being relocated to a new site to become a power plant and be switched to gas.
The Government said the turbines would be capable of quickly producing up to 276MW of energy, more than the 250MW originally outlined in the Government's plan.
The state-owned generators will be tested monthly and only used when required to prevent an electricity supply shortfall.
News Limited has reported this morning the diesel generators' capacity drop by 25 per cent in temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius, the exact conditions they are designed to work in to protect the state against widespread blackouts.
"[There will be] no issues at all," Mr Koutsantonis said.
"Every generator has a different capacity depending on the conditions.
"You buy a generator and it says it can do 250MW, that's in normal conditions. The hotter it is, the less it generates."
Mr Koutsantonis said he was not surprised the Opposition was trying to frighten people into thinking the generators would not work in extreme heat or by the "beat-up" by the newspaper.
He said the generators were on ships from Europe en route to Adelaide for installation.
