  <title>Elderly Vic man robbed, scooter keys taken</title>
  <content>
Two thugs have thrown an elderly Victorian man off his mobility scooter before taking his valuables and keys and telling him to "walk away".
The 69-year-old was travelling through Rosebud on his scooter with his dog on Wednesday morning when he was confronted by two men on the foreshore, police say.
The offenders demanded his wallet, and when he said he didn't have one, they took him off his scooter and stole his phone, ring and watch.
They then took the keys to his scooter and he was forced to walk to a shopping centre to call police.
