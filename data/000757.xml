  <title>Bull impresses at under-23 world championships</title>
  <content>
CANOE: Alyssa Bull is primed for a strong performance at the world championships in the Czech Republic later this month after capturing medals in the under-23 edition in Romania.
The 21-year-old claimed gold (K1 1000) and silver (K1 500) in Romania to confirm her status as one of the rising stars in the sport.
But her focus is still on the K2 and her partnership with fellow Sunshine Coaster Alyce Burnett.
The pair shocked many to reach the final at the Rip Olympics last year.
"I do love the K2. I hate going out there by myself, I'm more of a teamwork person," she said.
"I do miss having AB behind me pushing me down the course, but it is nice to know every now and then you can get out and do it by yourself.
"This year's focus at worlds is the K2 500 and I think it is going to be that way for this four-year cycle. I'm really looking forward to it."
A former ironwoman, Bull won a round of the elite summer surf lifesaving series as a teenager in 2013 but switched to kayaking a couple of seasons later.
The move paid off as she rapidly climbed the rungs of the sport, mainly alongside Burnett.
She's still improving as an individual competitor too and her performances in the junior world titles have provided her with a morale boost ahead of the world championships proper.
"It's pretty cool to be able to go back to your age group and have a race, but I miss doing it with my buddy AB," she said.
"Sometimes it's nice to be able to put a good race together in the K1, it makes you a little bit more confident and excited to do it in the front of the K2 as well."
Another Coaster, Bill Bain, finished eighth in the men's under-23 K1 1000 final.
