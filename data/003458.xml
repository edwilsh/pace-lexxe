  <content>

Maryborough Labor MP Bruce Saunders, who has access to the latest Commonwealth Games briefings as a member of a parliamentary tourism committee, has given a stunning inside view of the frantic preparations for next April's event.

"I'm on the Commonwealth Games committee and inside the Labor Party and we're pulling our hair out at the moment," Mr Saunders said yesterday towards the end of his regular Triple M Fraser Coast radio spot.

"I'll be quite honest with people, these trains were supposed to be up and running before the Commonwealth Games.
