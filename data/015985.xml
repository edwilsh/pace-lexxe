  <title>Fine defaulters face jail despite Dhu case</title>
  <content>
Law reform advocates in Western Australia are calling for change to stop fine defaulters being put behind bars, three years since the death of a 22-year-old Aboriginal woman in custody.
Ms Dhu, whose first name is not used for cultural reasons, died on August 4, 2014 after being locked up at South Hedland Police Station for unpaid fines totalling $3622, stemming from charges including assaulting police.
The Human Rights Law Centre said Ms Dhu should never have been taken into custody and urged the state government to stop locking up people who cannot pay fines.
