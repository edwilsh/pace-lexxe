BREAKING: A overturned wide-load vehicle is causing massive disruptions on the Toowoomba Range this morning.

A heavy vehicle with a wide load overturned on the eastbound top section of the range about 3am.

Toowoomba Police are on scene directing traffic, with one lane open.

A police spokesman said there was the potential for it to cause disruptions to traffic all day.

"We will probably have to block the up and down section of the range for recovery," he said.

Diversions will be put in place while the recovery is underway, which will be later today.
