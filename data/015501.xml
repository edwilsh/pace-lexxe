  <title>Northern Marianna Islands look to revive traditional languages</title>
  <content>
The loss of traditional language is a phenomenon felt throughout the region and the world, but the Northern Mariana Islands are hoping to reverse the trend by encouraging the use of two of its native tongues.
The Chamorro and Carolinian Language Commission is re-building its board after years of not having any commissioners.
They'll liaise with other government departments to promote the use of native languages in everyday life.
The commission's Executive Director Cindy Reyes says previous surveys have shown only 20 to 25% of people on the largest of the islands, Saipan, are speaking either language.
