Danger decision, fixture revealed

Matthew Kreuzer could yet face the Bombers this week

MATTHEW Kreuzer's recovery from concussion is progressing "slowly" but the in-form Carlton ruckman could still play in Saturday's clash against Essendon at the MCG. 

However, Blues leader Ed Curnow (bruised larynx) has been ruled out for the rest of the season.

Kreuzer suffered a mild concussion after being tackled by Geelong superstar Patrick Dangerfield last Saturday night, .

Kreuzer did not take part in the Blues' training session on Tuesday but will be given every chance to prove he's fit to take on the Bombers. 

"He's progressing slowly. He'll have a concussion test tomorrow. He's on very light duties at the moment and he'll be a test for the end of the week," Carlton football boss Andrew McKay told the club's website on Tuesday evening.

Curnow has not played since suffering a knock to his throat in the Blues' round 14 loss to Richmond.

Carlton was initially hopeful the leadership group member would return for last round's clash against Geelong, but last week pushed his comeback date back to round 23.

McKay said the Blues had now decided to rule Curnow out for the rest of the season.

"Ed Curnow saw the specialist late last week and follow-up scans revealed a little bit more damage than what we first thought," McKay said. 

"He has a slight split in that cartilage around the larynx, so he's out for the rest of the year unfortunately. But he'll be back for pre-season fit and healthy to go."

Key defender Alex Silvagni (knee) is expected to miss another three weeks, but Carlton is confident Ciaran Byrne (groin) will play at some level this week and Dylan Buckley (hamstring) faces a fitness test after making an unexpectedly quick recovery.
