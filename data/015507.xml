  <title>Done deal: Socceroo joins dad to take on A-League</title>
  <content>
WELLINGTON Phoenix have made a major statement of intent ahead of this year's A-League campaign, signing fringe Socceroos playmaker and former Western Sydney and Adelaide player Dario Vidosic.
The versatile Vidosic, who can play on either flank, at No.10 or even as a deep-lying striker, departed the Wanderers in 2016 after one season in red and black to sign for Chinese club Liaoning Whowin.
He quickly moved on to Korean outfit Seongnam FC, before signing for the Nix on Friday, where he'll be joined by father and assistant coach Rado. The 30-year-old has signed a one-year deal.
Vidosic, who has also played for clubs in Germany and Switzerland since breaking onto the scene as a teenager for Brisbane Roar, said the presence of his father and head coach Darije Kalezic were crucial for his move.
"He has such a great football background in Holland - it's a style of football that I've been searching for a while," Vidosic said of the Bosnian-Swiss coach.
"I thought the best place for me would be here, to enjoy my football again, and just to play with a smile on my face."
The acquisition of Vidosic, who will join first-team Phoenix training in around three weeks after a brief injury layoff, serves as a direct replacement for the Melbourne Victory-bound Kosta Barbarouses.
