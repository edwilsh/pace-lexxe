Two people have been run down by a car near Melbourne's Flinders Street Station with police hunting for the driver.
The pedestrian and cyclist, both believed to be men, were hit about 6.30pm on Thursday at the intersection of Flinders and Swanston streets.
The driver sped away and is yet to be found.
One person was treated at the scene and the other taken to The Alfred hospital in a stable condition with non-life threatening injuries, an ambulance spokeswoman said.
