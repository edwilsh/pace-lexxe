  <title>Winx heads all-star cast for Randwick trials</title>
  <content>
ALL eyes will be on superstar Winx on Tuesday morning when the champion mare ramps up her spring preparation in a barrier trial at Royal Randwick.
The 1000m heat on the course proper will be Winx's second trial in her campaign after she received  in her first appearance on July 24.
RACE WATCH:
HOT TIPS:
Of course Winx has never won a barrier trial in 15 attempts, stark contrast to her race record of 27 starts for 21 wins.
The six-year-old, set to resume in the Group 2 Warwick Stakes (1400m) at Randwick on August 19, has eight rivals in her heat on Tuesday.
WHO'S RUNNING?:
Possible The Everest contender Pariah, classy colt Invader and proven performers Antonio Giuseppe and Happy Clapper will also line up against Winx.
It will be an important set of trials, littered with Group 1 performers, with the likes of Foxplay, Redzel, Russian Revolution, Who Shot Thebarman, Comin' Through, Spectroscope, Siege Of Quebec and Ghisoni among those warming up for the spring.
Meanwhile, Hartnell has completed his first major hitout of his spring preparation completing an 800m jump out at Flemington on Friday.
In thick fog, the seven-year-old didn't appear to be tested by jockey Kerrin McEvoy finishing fourth behind Heatherly with Everest hopeful Redkirk Warrior running second.
