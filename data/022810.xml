  <title>Art Series Hotels sells to Mantra for $52 million</title>
  <content>
Melbourne's wealthy Deague family has sold the management and leasehold rights of its well-known Art Series Hotels to Mantra Group for $52.5 million.
The Deague Group, a privately held property business, opened its first hotel in 2009 in inner-city Prahran and named it after Australian artist Adam Cullen, whose works hang on the hotel's walls.

Inside Sofitel Sydney Darling Harbour

A peek inside Sydney's first 5-star luxury hotel to open in almost 20 years.

Since then, the group has expanded across Victoria, South Australia and Queensland and now has seven four- to five-star boutique hotels with more than 1000 suites named after notable painters like John Olsen and Charles Blackman.

ASX-listed Mantra Group - which controls the Peppers, Mantra and Breakfree hotel brands - said it funded the acquisition of the leasehold, management rights and Art Series brand with cash and debt facilities.
The deal also includes freehold title to key commercial areas in the hotels, receptions and administration offices.

Mantra Group's existing hotel portfolio covers 128 properties with more than 21,500 rooms under management in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and Hawaii.

The transaction would contribute about $7 million to Mantra's underlying earnings before interest and tax in its first full year of ownership, group chief executive Bob East said.Photo: Supplied
"This acquisition enhances our existing portfolio and presents a unique opportunity for Mantra Group to increase its footprint across three key locations (Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide) in a single transaction," he said.
Investment bank Citi recently downgraded its earnings expectations for Mantra on the back of declining occupancy on the Gold Coast, hit by the Dreamworld disaster, and subdued demand in Melbourne which makes up 13 per cent of the group's rooms.
The deal includes a hotel under development in the Deague's latest property venture in Box Hill, expected to open this November, which would be loss-making in its first year of ownership, Mr East said.
The Deague's $330 million twin-tower project, Whitehorse Towers, includes 511 apartments, shops, commercial space and a luxury 100-room hotel, The Chen, named after Chinese Australian artist Zhong Chen.
The Art Series Hotels are currently being managed by Event Hospitality, the managers behind Rydges and QT branded hotels.
The Deague Group, controlled by siblings Will, Jono, Anthony and Camilla, has about 1750 apartments under construction, as well as offices and business parks.
Chief executive Will Deague said the hotel series was "always a real estate play" and had generated sales in excess of $570 million.
Some of that came in 2015 when the group offloaded the 229-room Olsen in Chapel Street and the 113-room Culleen to the Singapore-based fund of British investment giant M&G Investments for a combined $146 million.
The Chen in Box Hill and The Johnson in Brisbane sold to individual Chinese investors for about $30 million each, he said.
The family will retain ownership of its 128-room Schaller Studio hotel in Bendigo and is building a 165-room luxury hotel on the river in Brisbane as part of the Howard Smith Wharves redevelopment.
Art Series Hotels include:
The Cullen, Prahran, Melbourne VIC
The Larwill Studio, North Melbourne VIC
The Olsen, South Yarra, Melbourne VIC
The Blackman, St Kilda Road, Melbourne VIC
The Chen, Box Hill, Melbourne VIC (under construction)
The Johnson, Spring Hill, Brisbane QLD
The Watson, Walkerville, Adelaide SA
