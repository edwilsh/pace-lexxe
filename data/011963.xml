  <title>Australian cricket's pay dispute finally over</title>
  <content>
Australian cricket's bitter pay war appears to finally be over.
Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland and his Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA) counterpart Alistair Nicholson have called a press conference for 4.30pm in Melbourne.
It is believed the pair has reached an agreement on a new memorandum of understanding (MOU).
The ACA had vowed no player would make themselves available for selection until the new MOU was signed.
The stand-off saw the Australia A tour of South Africa cancelled and threatened the upcoming tour to Bangladesh, with players due to fly to Dhaka on August 18.
