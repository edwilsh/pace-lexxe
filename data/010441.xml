  <title>Men charged for central Qld bomb hoaxes</title>
  <content>
Two men have been charged for staging bomb hoaxes on a major shopping centre and a service station in central Queensland.
Threatening phone calls were made to the staff of KFC at Stockland Rockhampton on June 22, sparking an evacuation of the shopping centre.
Later that evening a second hoax call was made to a local service station.
A 24-year old and 22-year-old man will appear in Rockhampton Magistrates Court on Thursday.
