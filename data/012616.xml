  <title>Stipes deem winner Cellarman ineligible</title>
  <content>
A WINNING horse at Gosford last Saturday had to be subsequently disqualified this week after it was found to be ineligible for the race.
Racing NSW stewards fined Chris Waller $200 for nominating Cellarman for the Class 2 Handicap, which the horse went on to win before being subsequently disqualified.
RACE WATCH:
TOP TIPS:
Cellarman had only won one race before Saturday's outing but it was a Listed race, meaning the horse was automatically considered a Class 5 horse.
Stewards told Racing Confidential it was a data issue and that internal mechanisms, which are in place to reject such nominations, weren't triggered. They are undergoing an internal review to ensure it doesn't happen again.
Sir Magic is the new winner of the race.O'Shea charged over strangles case
RACING NSW stewards have issued charges against former Godolphin Australia employees  and John O'Shea as the strangles inquiry gets set to continue on Friday.
Former Godolphin Australia managing director Plumptre and former head trainer O'Shea were presented with the following charges in relation to Godolphin racehorse Polemic being infected with strangles, a highly contagious infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract, in August 2016.
Plumptre was issued with one charge under AR64K (2) for not reporting to Racing NSW as soon as possible that Polemic was confirmed as being infected with strangles from on or about August 5 last year.
O'Shea was issued with two charges - the first under AR175(l) for being a party to Plumptre committing a breach of AR64K (2) for not reporting to Racing NSW as soon as possible that Polemic was confirmed as being infected with strangles from on or about August 4 last year.
O'Shea has also been charged under AR175(g) of providing false and/or misleading evidence in a stewards' interview on June 16 and a stewards' inquiry on June 27.
The hearing of the charges has been scheduled to be conducted at Racing NSW headquarters at 10:30am on Friday.Track switch
