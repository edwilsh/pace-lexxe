THEY are the world's smallest monkey but they are proving a big hit at Tasmania Zoo.
Four impossibly cute pygmy Marmoset monkeys arrived at the Launceston wildlife park from Mogo Zoo in New South Wales this week.
The little primates, all females, weight just 100g and are already eating out of the hands of zoo staff and entertaining visitors with their high-energy antics.
The monkeys are native to South America but have adapted to their new heated Tasmanian home with ease.
"They have settled in really well. They are very friendly and eating well," head keeper Emma Morgan said today.
Their favourite foods include sap from acacia trees, beetles, crickets and millworms.
The little monkeys' biggest threats in the wild are habitat destruction and the black market.
"They are sold as finger monkeys and the black market trade is particularly strong in Colombia," Ms Morgan said.
In the jungle their main predators are birds of prey, snakes and larger primates.
Tasmania Zoo hopes to import some male pygmy Marmosets and breed the petite primates in captivity.
