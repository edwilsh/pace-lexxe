  <title>Beaches lift on emotional wave</title>

BIG PLAY: Adrian Delore scored two tires and made a clutch tackle at the death.

â€‹COACH Johan Lourens couldn't think of a better performance - or game - after Southern Beaches hung on for an emotional 20-14 triumph over Wanderers at Alan Davis Field on Saturday and take a stranglehold of third place.
Both sides went at it from the get go in a fierce contest that ebbed and flowed.
After trailing 8-5 at half-time, Beaches found their groove to lead 20-9.
In the end, it took a desperate tackle by fullback Adrian Delore to nudge Wanderers breakaway Tom Eymael into touch on the last play of the game to seal the win.
"It was one of the best games I have watched this year," Lourens said. "It was an absolute slog. Neither team stopped. It was one of those games, I want to watch it again. It was that good."
Beaches were without captain Va Talaileva (concussion) and experienced breakaway Marlon Solofuti (overseas) but the rest of the pack lifted.
"Forwards win games of rugby and our tight-five really stepped up," Lourens said.
The win moved Beaches to 53 points, eight clear of Maitland, and also secured the Tony Wansey Sheild. Wansey, who has been an integral member at both clubs, has fallen on ill health. 

"Tony means a hell of a lot to the club," Lourens said. "There is not a player in the club that Tony hasn't affected in some way."

At Marcellin Park, Max Stafford and Pat Batey scored two tries each as Maitland disposed of Nelson Bay 45-15. Chase Hicks scored a brace to help steer The Waratahs to an emphatic 52-22 win over Singleton at Waratah Oval.
