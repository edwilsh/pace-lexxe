  <title>Toomey flexes her muscles at world CrossFit Games</title>
  <content>
CROSSFIT: Maroochy River product Tia Clair Toomey has been flexing her muscles at the Crossfit Games.
The 23-year-old Rio Olympics weight-lifter has been amid the thick of the action in the women's event and was leading the standings heading into the final round of competition at Wisconsin, to be held early on Monday morning (AEST).
The competition consists of several strength and endurance events, with points accumulated throughout.
Amid the first six rotations, she won the muscle-up clean ladder and was second in the 1RM snatch and the Heavy 17-6.
Compatriot Kara Webb, who was coming second overall, won the latter event and she lauded Clair-Toomey for pushing her to her limit.
"That girl gets me moving hey," she said.
"It is so cool having Aussie chicks up the top.
"She keeps me on my toes and I;m really grateful for her because it makes me get more uncomfotable than I'd like to."
Clair Toomey was second at the CrossFit Games in 2016 and in 2016.
Toomey, who is now based in Gladstone but still calls the Sunshine Coast home, owns a gym and only started weightlifting in earnest less than three years ago.
She was 14th at the Games in Brazil.
